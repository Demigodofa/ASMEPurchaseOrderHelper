SA-487 /SA-487M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Steel Castings Suitable for Pressure Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers low-alloy steels and marten­
sitic stainless steels in the normalized and tempered, or 
quenched and tempered, condition suitable for pressure­
containing parts. The weldability of the classes in this speci­
fication varies from readily weldable to weldable only with 
adequate precautions, and the weldability of each class should 
be considered prior to assembly by fusion welding. 
1.2 Selection will depend on design, mechanical, and ser­
vice conditions. Users should note that hardenability of some 
of the grades mentioned may restrict the maximum size at 
which the required mechanical properties are obtained. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
• are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. C9mbining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the standard. 
1.3.1 Within the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

8. Quality 
8.1 The surface of the casting shall be free of adhering sand, 
scale, cracks, and hot tears as determined by visual examina­
tion. Other surface discontinuities shall meet the visual accep­
tance standards specified in the order. Visual Method SP-55 or 
other visual standards may be used to define acceptable surface 
discontinuities and finish. Unacceptable visual surface discon­
tinuities shall be removed and their removal verified by visual 
examination of the resultant cavities. When methods involving 
high temperatures are used in the removal and repair of 
discontinuities, the casting shall be preheated to at least the 
minimum temperature in Table 4. 
8.2 The castings shall not be peened, plugged, or impreg­
nated to stop leaks. 
9. Repair By Welding 
9.1 For castings other than those intended for use under 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, repairs shall be made 
using procedures and welders qualified under Practice A488/ 
A488M. 
9.2 On castings intended for use under the ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code, repairs shall be made by procedures 
and welders qualified under Section IX of that code. 
9.3 After repair welding, all castings shall be post-weld heat 
treated in accordance with Table 4 or reheat treated in 
accordance with Table 1. 
9.4 Weld repairs shall be inspected using the same quality 
standards as are used to inspect the castings. Re-examination of

Steel Forgings for Pressure Vessels 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers quenched and tempered 
vacuum-treated carbon and alloy steel forgings for pressure 
vessels such as those used in reactor systems. Specifically, it 
covers forgings for vessel closures, shells, flanges, tube sheets, 
rings, heads, and similar parts. 
1.2 All grades are considered weldable under proper condi­
tions. Welding technique is of fundamental importance, and it 
is presupposed that welding procedure and inspection will be in 
accordance with approved. methods for the grade of material 
used. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.4 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch­
pound units. 
Norn I-Grades 1 and lA are composed of different chemistries but 
have the same mechanical requirements.

safety concerns, if any, associated with _its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the

the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out­
lines additional ordering information, manufacturing 
requirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, 
marking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi­
tional supplementary requirements. 
4.3.1 When specified by the purchaser, it is permissible to 
perform Magnetic particle examination using the AC yoke in 
accordance with Practice A966/ A966M instead of using Prac­
tice A275/A275M (see 9.2.1). 
4.4 The optional minimum silicon content as expressed in 
Footnote B to Table 1, if required. 
4.5 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict

7.1.6.3 Method 3-Test specimens shall be taken from a 
representative separate test forging made from the same heat of 
steel and shall receive substantially the same reduction and 
type of hot working as the production forgings that it represents 
and shall have the same Tc as the as-quenched production 
forgings. The separate test forging shall be heat treated in the 
same furnace charge and under the same conditions as the 
production forgings. Test specimens shall be removed from the 
region midway between the mid-thickness and the surface, and 
not closer than Tc to a second heat treated surface with the 
same limitation on forging thickness as in 7.1.6.2. 
Alternatively, an extra production forging of the same configu­
ration (right and left handed configurations being considered 
equivalent) as that ordered, may be tested as described in 
Method 2. 
7.1.6.4 Method 4-A thermal buffer ring, at least Tc by Tc 
in cross section, or segments of such a ring at least 3 Tc in 
length, shall be welded to the test"end of a forging prior to heat 
treatment for mechanical properties. The buffer material may 
be any weldable carbon or low-alloy steel and shall be joined 
to the forging with a partial-penetration type weld which 
completely seals the buffered surface. The test coupons shall be 
removed from the forging in the region buffered by the ring or 
ring segments. If ring segments are used, the test coupons shall 
be removed from the forging in the area under the buffer ring 
segment at a minimum distance of Tc from each end of that 
segment. In either case, the test specimens shall be located at 
a minimum distance of V2 in. [13 mm] from the buffered 
surface of the forging, and at least V4 Tc from a quenched 
surface of the forging. Where this method of testing is 
employed, the limitations for Tc given in 7.1.6.2 shall gener­
ally apply. 
NoTE 5-For forgings with a maximum Tc of 2 in. [50 mm], the 
specimens shall be taken at midthickness and at least 2 in. from a second 
surface. This provision is applicable to all four methods in 7 .1.6. 
7.1.7 Tension specimens shall be the standard 0.5 in. 
[12.5 mm] round by 2 in. [50 mm] gauge length, as shown in 
Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
7.2 Impact Test-The steel shall conform to the require­
ments of Table 3, or Supplementary Requirement SlO may be 
specified instead of these requirements. 
7.2.1 Number, Location, and Orientation of Specimens: 
7.2.1.1 One set of three Charpy V-notch specimens shall be 
taken from each tensile specimen location required in 7 .1.2. 
Orientation shall be the same as in 7 .1.4. When S 10 is 
specified, the required number of tests shall be governed by 
NB, NC, ND, NE, NF, or NG 2300, as applicable. 
7 .2.1.2 The requirements of 7 .1.3 also apply to impact 
specimens. 
7.2.1.3 The longitudinal axis and mid-length of the impact 
specimen shall be located similarly to the longitudinal axis of 
the tension test specimens as defined in 7.1.6. The axis of the 
notch shall be normal to the nearest heat-treated surface of the 
forging. When Supplementary Requirement S 10 is specified 
the orientation shall be governed by NB, NC, ND, NE, NF, or 
NG 2300. 
7.2.2 Impact specimens shall be Charpy V-notch as shown 
in Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
8. Workmanship and Quality Level Requirements 
8.1 See requirements in 9.1, 9.2.2, 9.3.1.1, and 9.3.2.2. 
9. Nondestructive Inspection Requirements 
9.1 General Requirements-Dimensional and visual 
inspections, and magnetic particle and ultrasonic inspection 
shall be conducted by the manufacturer. Forgings shall be free 
of cracks, thermal ruptures, or other injurious indications. 
9.2 Magnetic Particle Inspection: 
9.2.1 Following final machining by the manufacturer all 
accessible surfaces of each forging shall be examined by the 
continuous current magnetic particle method. This examination 
shall be in accordance with Practice A275/A275M unless the 
purchaser has required the use of the AC yoke in accordance 
with Practice A966/A966M instead (see 4.3.1). 
840 
9.2.2 The following conditions are subject to rejection or 
removal: 
9.2.2.1 Indications with major dimension exceeding 3/16 in. 
[4.8 mm]. 
9.2.2.2 Four or more indications exceeding V!6 in. [1.6 mm] 
in major dimensions that are aligned and separated by V16 in. 
[1.6 mm] or less end to end. 
9.2.2.3 Ten or more indications exceeding V16 in. [1.6 mm] 
in major dimensions contained in any 6 in.2 [39 cm 2 ] of

9.3.1.3 Indications whose amplitude equals or exceeds that 
of the back reflection established in an indication-free area of 
the forging. 
9.3.2 Angle Beam Inspection: 
9.3.2.1 Calibration notches shall be cut into the inside- and 
outside-diameter surfaces with a depth equal to 3 % of the 
nominal section thickness (or 3 /s in. [9.5 mm], max), a length of 
approximately 1 in. [25 mm], and a width not greater than 
twice its depth. Adjust instrument controls to obtain an 
indication from the inside-diameter notch approximately 75 % 
of full screen height. Measure the amplitude of indication from 
the outside-diameter notch. Draw a straight line on the shield in 
front of the cathode ray tube from this peak to that of the 
inside-diameter notch and continue it as a horizontal line to the 
initial pulse. This line constitutes the angle beam reference 
line. 
9.3.2.2 A forging containing a discontinuity which results in 
an indication exceeding the amplitude of the reference line is 
subject to rejection. 
Norn 6-Signals from discontinuities within approximately ¼ in. 
[6.4 mm] of inside and outside surfaces are reinforced by wave trapping 
during angle beam inspection; they are therefore amplified in respect to 
internal discontinuities. 
9.3.3 The report of the ultrasonic inspection shall be in 
compliance with Section 8 of Practice A388/A388M.

melting is employed, the heat shall be defined as all of the 
ingots remelted from a single primary heat. 
4.4 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When 
steel of different grades is sequentially strand cast, identifica­
tion of the resultant transition material is required. The 
producer shall remove the transition material by an established 
procedure that positively separates the grades. 
4.5 Tubes shall be made by the electric-resistance-welded 
process and shall be made from hot- or cold-rolled steel as 
specified. 
4.5.1 The weld shall not be located within the radius of the 
comers of any shaped tube unless specified by the purchaser. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5 .1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1 or Table 2 (See 
Specification A1040). If no grade is specified, Grades MT 1010 
to MT 1020 may be furnished. Analyses of steels other than 
those listed are available. To determine their availability, the 
purchaser should contact the producer. 
5.2 When a carbon steel grade is ordered under this 
specification, supplying an alloy grade that specifically re­
quires the addition of any element other than those listed for 
the ordered grade in Tables 1 and 2 is not permitted. 
5.3 Mechanical tubing with improved ductility may be 
produced from Drawing Steel (Types A and B), Deep Drawing 
Steel, or Extra Deep Drawing Steels identified in Specifications 
A1008/A1008M, A1011/A1011M, or Al039/A1039M. Those 
Specifications offer guidance in the form of nonmandatory 
Typical Ranges of Mechanical Properties. 
6. Heat Analysis 
6.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the 
steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of the ele­
ments specified; if secondary melting processes are employed, 
the heat analysis shall be obtained from one remelted ingot or 
the product of one remelted ingot of each primary melt. The 
heat analysis shall conform to the requirements specified,

A Flash-In-Tubing is produced only to outside diameter tolerances and wall thickness tolerances and the inside diameter welding flash does not exceed the wall thickness 
or %2 in. (2.4 mm], whichever is less. 
8 Flash Controlled to 0.010 in. (0.25 mm] maximum tubing consists of tubing which is commonly produced only to outside diameter tolerances and wall thickness 
tolerances, in which the height of the remaining welding flash is controlled not to exceed 0.010 in. 
c Flash Controlled to 0.005 in. [0.13 mm] maximum tubing is produced to outside diameters and wall thickness tolerance, inside diameter and wall thickness tolerances, 
or outside diameters and inside diameter tolerances, in which the height of the remaining flash is controlled not to exceed 0.005 in. Any remaining flash is considered to 
be part of the applicable inside diameter tolerances.

beveled protractor equipped with a level, and noting the 
angular deviation on opposite ends, or at any point throughout 
the length. 
9.6 Straightness-The straightness tolerance is 1/16 in./3 ft 
[1.7 mm/1 m]. The test method for straightness measurement is 
at the manufacturer's option, unless a specific test method is 
specified in the purchase order. 
10. Tubing Sections Other Than Square and Rectangular 
10.1 In addition to square and rectangular tubing, many 
producers supply a variety of special sections, such as oval, 
streamlined, hexagonal, octagonal, round inside and hexagonal 
or octagonal outside, ribbed inside or out, triangular, rounded 
rectangular and D shapes. Manufacturing practices limit the 
size range and section available from the various producers. 
These special sections may be made through turkshead rolls or 
through a die with or without use of a mandrel. Since the 
sections are special, dies and other tools are not held available. 
Therefore, when inquiring for shapes other than square and 
rectangular, it is essential to give full details as to dimensions 
and finish. 
11. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
851 
11.1 The tubing shall be free of injurious defects and shall 
have a workmanlike finish.

15.1 Tubes that fail to meet the requirements of this 
specification shall be set aside and the producer shall be 
notified. 
16. Product and Package Marking 
16.1 Civilian Procurement-Each box, bundle, lift, or piece 
shall be identified by a tag or stencil with manufacturers name 
or brand, specified size, type, purchaser's order number, and 
this specification number. Bar coding is acceptable as a 
supplementary identification method. Bar coding should be 
consistent with the Automotive Industry Action Group [AIAG] 
858 
standard prepared by the Primary Metals Subcommittee of the 
AIAG Bar Code Project Team. 
16.2 Government Procurement-When specified in the con­
tract or order, and for direct procurement by or direct shipment 
to the Government, marking for shipment, in addition to 
requirements specified in the contract or order, shall be in 
accordance withr.IlL=STD-129 for Military agencies and m 
accordance with Fed. Std. No. 123 for civil agencies. 
16.3 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 16.1 
and 16.2, bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identifi­
cation method. The purchaser may specify in the order a 
specific bar coding system to be used. 
17. Packaging 
17.1 Civilian Procurement-On tubing 16 gauge, 0.065 in. 
[1.7 mm] and lighter, the producer will determine whether or 
not the tubing will be boxed, crated, cartoned, packaged in 
secured lifts, or bundled to ensure safe delivery unless other­
wise instructed. Tubing heavier than 16 gauge will normally be 
shipped loose, bundled, or in secured lifts. Special packaging

shapes when in the round form shall meet the following 
destructive weld tests. 
S6.2 Flattening Test-A test 4 to 6 in. [100 to 150 mm] in 
length shall be flattened between parallel plates with the weld 
90° from the direction of applied force (at the point of 
maximum bending) until opposite walls of the tubing meet. 
Except as allowed in S6.2.1, no opening in the weld shall take 
place until the distance between the plates is less than two 
thirds of the original outside diameter of the tubing. No cracks 
or breaks in the base metal shall occur until the distance 
between the plates is less than one third of the original outside 
diameter of the tubing, but in no case less than five times the 
thickness of the tubing wall. Evidence of lamination or burnt 
material shall not develop during the flattening process, and the 
weld shall not show injurious defects. 
S6.2.1 When low D-to-t ratio tubing is tested, because the 
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the 
-inside-surface-ar-the six arnitwelve o'clock-locmions, cracRs at" 
these locations shall not be cause for rejection if the D-to-t ratio 
is less than 10. 
S6.3 Flaring Test-A section of tube approximately 4 in. 
[100 mm] in length shall stand being flared with a tool having 
a 60° included angle until the tube at the mouth of the flare has 
been expanded 15 % of the inside diameter, without cracking 
or showing flaws. 
S6.4 In order to properly evaluate weld quality, the producer 
at his option may normalize the test specimen prior to testing. 
S6.5 Number of tests and retests: 
S6.5.1 Two flattening and two flaring tests shall be made 
from each lot as specified. Each tested specimen shall conform 
to the respective requirement (See Note Sl). 
S6.5.2 If the results of the testing do not conform to the 
requirements, retests shall be made on four additional 
specimens, each of which shall conform to the respective 
requirement.

follows: 
where: 
2St P=­ D 
P = minimum hydrostatic test pressure, psi or MPa, 
S = allowable fiber stress of 14 000 psi or 96.5 MPa, 
t = specified wall thickness, in. or mm, and 
D = specified outside diameter, in. or mm. 
S7 .2 The minimum hydrostatic test pressue shall be main­
tained for not less than 5 s. 
S8. Nondestructive Electric Test 
S8.l Each tube shall be tested with a nondestructive electric 
test in accordance with Practice E213, Practice E273, Practice 
E309, or Practice E570. It is the intent of this test to reject tubes 
containing injurious defects. 
S8.2 For eddy-current testing, the calibration tube shall 
contain, at the option of the producer, any one of the following 
discontinuities to establish a minimum sensitivity level for 
rejection. For welded tubing, they shall be placed in the weld 
if visible. 
S8.2.l Drilled Hole-A hole not larger than 0.031 in. [0.78 
mm] in diameter shall be drilled radially and completely 
through the tube wall, care being taken to avoid distortion of 
the tube wlille drilling. - -- - -
S8.2.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool or 
file with a ¼-in. [6.4-mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the tube. Said notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.101 mm], whichever is greater. 
S8.2.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.78 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
tube axis on the outside surface of the tube, to have a depth not 
exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.101 mm], whichever is greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
S8.3 For ultrasonic testing, the longitudinal calibration ref­
erence notches shall be at the option of the producer, any one 
of the three common notch shapes shown in Practice E213 or 
Practice E273. The depth of notch shall not exceed 12½ % of 
the specified wall thickness of the tube or 0.004 in. [0.101

APPENDIX 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. MEASURING MICROINCH FINISH 
Xl.1 The procedure for making microinch readings on 
interior surfaces of cold worked tubing (not polished or 
ground) ½-in. [12.7-mm] inside diameter and larger is as 
follows: 
Xl.1.1 Measurements on tubing with longitudinal or no 
predominant lay should be circumferential on the inside 
surface of the straight tube, prior to any fabrication, on a plane 
approximately perpendicular to the tube axis. Measurements 
on tubing with circumferential lay should be longitudinal. 
Xl.1.2 Measurements should be made not less than 1 in. 
[25.4 mm] from the end. 
Xl.1.3 Measurements should be made at four positions 
approximately 90° apart or over a complete circumference if 
the trace should otherwise overlap. 
X 1.1.4 The length of trace should be in accordance with the 
latest revision of Section 4.5 of ASME B46.1 (not less than 
0.600 in. [15.24 mm] long). 
Xl.1.5 A minimum of three such measurements should be 
made spaced not less than ¼ in. [6.4 mm] apart along the 
longitudinal axis. 
Xl.1.6 The numerical rating shall be the arithmetical aver­
age microinch of all readings taken. Each reading to be 
averaged should be the mean position of the indicator during 
the trace; any momentary meter excursions occupying less than 
10 % of the total trace should be ignored. 
Xl.1.7 A deviation in numerical rating in various parts of a 
tube may be expected. Experience to date indicates that a 
variation of about ±35 % is normal. 
Xl.2 Instruments should meet the specifications given in the 
latest revision of ASME B46.1. 
Xl.3 Mecharucal tracing is preferred. If hand tracing is 
used, the speed of trace should not vary by more than ±20 % 
from the required to give the appropriate cutoff. The 0.030-in. 
[0.76 mm] roughness width cutoff should be used. 
Xl.4 Microinch [0.0000254 mm] determinations only refer 
to roughness of areas that do not contain a defect, injurious or 
otherwise. Such defects as seams, slivers, pits, laps, etc., are 
subject to ordinary visual inspection in accordance with 
applicable specifications or trade customs, and have no rela­
tionship to roughness.

60 [415] 6Q-80 [415-550] 
65 (450] 65-85 [450-585] 
70 [485] 70-90 [485-620] 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.4 For plates produced from coil and furnished without 
heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the additional 
requirements, including additional testing requirements and the 
reporting of additional test results, of Specification A20/ A20M 
apply. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Develovment of International Standards. Guides and Recom­
mendations iss~ed by the World Trade Organization Technical

11. Method of Impact Testing 
11.1 The impact test shall be made in accordance with 
the simple beam, Charpy type of test described in the latest 
issue of Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
11.2 Precaution shall be taken so that when broken, 
the test specimens shall be within ± 3°F [l.7°C] of the 
specified test temperature. 
12. Inspection 
12.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall 
have free entry, at all times while work on the contract 
of the purchaser is being performed, to all parts of the 
manufacturer's works that concern the manufacture of the 
material ordered. The manufacturer shall afford the inspec­
tor all reasonable facilities to satisfy the inspector that 
the material is being furnished in accordance with this 
specification. All tests (except product analysis) and 
inspection shall be made at the place of manufacture prior 
to shipment, unless otherwise specified, and shall be con­
ducted so as not to interfere unnecessarily with the opera­
tion of the works. 
12.2 The manufacturer shall report to the purchaser or 
the purchaser's representative the heat treatments applied 
to the material and to the test blocks and the results of the 
chemical analysis and mechanical tests made in accordance 
with this specification and the heat number or his heat 
identification. 
13. Rejection 
13.1 Unless otherwise specified, any rejection based 
on tests made in accordance with Section 5 and 7 shall be 
including the impact test temperature, and test coupon 
stress relief details if applicable, 
14.1.4 Results of any additional or supplementary 
requirements specified by the purchaser, and 
14.1.5 The year date and revision letter, if any, of 
the specification. Note, this information is not required to 
be marked on the forgings. 
15. Product Marking 
15.1 Each forging shall be legibly stamped by the man­
ufacturer with the heat number or his heat identification, 
the manufacturer's name (see Note 1) or trademark, and 
this specification number, A 522 or A 522M as applicable, 
8Nl, or 9NI, and QT or NNT as applicable. 
NOTE 1 - For purposes of identification marking, the manufacturer 
is considered the organization that certifies the piping component was 
manufactured, sampled, and tested in accordance with this specification 
and the results have been determined to meet the requirements of this 
specification. 
15.2 Forgings impact tested at a temperature other than 
that specified in Table 3, by the use of Supplementary 
Requirement S2, shall be marked with the letters LTV 
following the specification number, as well as the tempera­
ture scale used. For forgings to A 522, these letters shall 
be followed by the impact test temperature in degrees 
Fahrenheit. A prefix 0 to the test temperature indicates a 
temperature below 0°F, for example A 522 Type 1 
LTV0300F indicates -300°F. For forgings to A 522M, the 
letters LTV shall be followed by the impact test tempera­
ture in degrees Celsius. A prefix 0 to the test temperature 
indicates a temperature below 0°C, for example A 522M 
Type 1 LTV0150C indicates -150°C.

4. General Requirements 
4.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the applicable requirements of the current edition of Specifi­
cation A530/ A530M unless otherwise provided herein. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Process: 
5.1.1 The steel shall be killed steel made by one or more of 
the following processes: electric-furnace, basic-oxygen, or any 
other commercially viable process. 
5.1.2 The steel shall be made to fine grain practice. 
5.1.3 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. 
When steel of different grades are sequentially strand cast, 
identification of the resultant transition material is required. 
The producer shall remove the transition material by any 
established procedure that positively separates the grades. 
5.1.4 Pipe NPS 1 ½ [DN 40] and under may be either hot 
finished or cold drawn. 
5.1.5 Unless otherwise specified, pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] and 
over shall be furnished hot finished. When agreed upon 
between the manufacturer and purchaser, cold-drawn pipe may 
be furnished. 
5.2 Heat Treatment-All hot-finished and cold-drawn pipe 
shall be reheated to a temperature above 1550°F [845°C] and 
followed by cooling in air or in the cooling chamber of a 
controlled atmosphere furnace. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements 
prescribed in Table 1. 
7. Heat Analysis 
7.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the 
steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of the ele­
ments specified in Section 6. The chemical composition thus 
determined, or that determined from a product analysis made 
by the manufacturer, if the latter has not manufactured the 
steel, shall be reported to the purchaser or the purchaser's 
representative, and shall conform to the requirements specified 
in Section 6. 
8. Product Analysis 
8.1 At the request of the purchaser, analyses of two pipes 
from each lot (Note 2) shall be made by the manufacturer from 
the finished pipe. The chemical composition thus determined 
shall conform to the requirements specified in Section 6. 
Norn 2-A lot shall consist of 400 lengths, or fraction thereof, for each 
size NPS 2 [DN 50] up to but not including NPS 6 [DN 150], and of 200 
lengths, or fraction thereof, for each size NPS 6 [DN 150] and over. 
8.2 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 8.1 does 
not conform to the requirements specified in Section 6, 
analyses shall be made on additional pipe of double the original 
number from the same lot, each of which shall conform to 
requirements specified. 
9. Physical Properties 
9.l Tensile Properties-The material shall conform to the 
requirements as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. 
9.2 Bending Properties: 
9.2.1 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] and under, a sufficient length 
of pipe shall stand being bent cold through 90° around a 
cylindrical mandrel, the diameter of which is twelve times the 
nominal diameter of the pipe, without developing cracks. 
When ordered for close coiling, the pipe shall stand being bent 
cold through 180° around a cylindrical mandrel, the diameter 
of which is eight times the nominal diameter of the pipe, 
without failure. 
9.2.2 For pipe whose diameter exceeds 25 in. [635 mm] and 
whose diameter to wall thickness ratio is 7.0 or less, bend test 
specimens shall be bent at room temperature through 180° 
without cracking on the outside of the bent portion. The inside 
diameter of the bend shall be 1 in. [25 .4 mm]. This test shall be 
in place of Section 10. 
Norn 3-Diameter to wall thickness ratio = specified outside diameter/ 
nominal wall thickness. 
Example: For 28 in. [710 mm] diameter 5.000 in. [125 mm] thick pipe the 
diameter to wall thickness ratio = 28/5 = 5.6. 
10. Flattening Test Requirements 
10.1 For pipe over NPS 2 [DN 50], a section of pipe not less 
than 2½ in. [63.5 mm] in length shall be flattened cold between 
parallel plates until the opposite walls of the pipe meet. 
Flattening tests shall be in accordance with Specification 
A530/A530M, except that in the equation used to calculate the 
H~valu8,th?-foll~wing~ constants shall be used: 
887 
0.07 for Grade I 
0.08 for Grade II 
10.2 When low D-to-t ratio tubulars are tested, because the 
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the 
inside smface at the 6 and 12 o'clock locations, cracks at these 
locations shall not be cause for rejection if the D-to-t ratio is 
less than ten. 
11. Hydrostatic Test Requirements 
11.1 Each length of pipe shall be subjected to the hydro­
static pressure, except as provided in 11.2. 
11.2 When specified in the order, pipe may be furnished 
without hydrostatic testing and each length so furnished shall 
include with the mandatory marking the letters "NH." 
11.3 When certification is required by the purchaser and the 
hydrostatic test has been omitted, the certification shall clearly

Xl. DIMENSIONS AND WALL TfilCKNESSES 
Xl.1 Following are Tables Xl.1 and Xl.2, cited in the text 
of this standard. 
TABLE X1.1 Table of Minimum Wall Thicknesses on Inspection for Nominal (Average) Pipe Wall Thickness 
NoTE 1-Tue following equation, upon which this table is based, may be applied to calculate minimum wall thickness from nominal (average) wall 
thickness: 
tn X 0.875 = tm 
where: 
tn = nominal (average) wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
tm = minimum wall thickness, in. [mm]. 
NOTE 2--Tue wall thickness is expressed to three decimal places, the fourth decimal place being carried forward or dropped, in accordance with 
Practice E29. This table is a master table covering wall thicknesses available in the purchase of different classifications of pipe, but it is not meant to imply 
that all of the walls listed therein are obtainable under this specification.

Specification for 
General Requirements for Specialized Carbon and Alloy 
Steel Pipe 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers a group of requirements 
which, with the exceptions of Section 6.3, Section 14, Section 
21, and Section 22, are mandatory requirements to the ASTM 
pipe product specifications noted below unless the product 
specification specifies different requirements, in which case the 
requirement of the product specification shall prevail. 
1.2 Sections 6.3 or 21 are mandatory if the product speci­
fication has a requirement for product analysis or flattening 
tests. 
1.3 Section 22 is mandatory if the product specification has 
a hydrostatic test requirement without defining the test param­
eters. 
1.4 Section 14 is for infonnation only. 
1.5 In case of conflict between a requirement of the product 
specification and a requirement of this general requirement 
specification, only the requirement of the product specification 
need be satisfied.

1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation (SI) of the product specification is specified in the 
order. 
Norn 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
1.7 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It shall be the responsibility of the purchaser to specify 
all requirements necessary for product under this specification. 
Such requirements to be considered include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (feet, meters, or number of lengths), 
4.1.2 Specification number with grade or class, or both, as 
applicable and year date, 
4.1.3 Manufacture (hot-finished or cold drawn), 
4.1.4 Size (NPS [DN] and weight class or schedule number, 
or both; outside diameter and nominal wall thickness; or inside 
diameter and nominal wall thickness), 
4.1.5 Length (specific or random), 
4.1.6 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test 
Methods A1058 when material is ordered to an M suffix (SI 
units) product standard. If the choice of test track is not 
specified in the order, then the default ASTM test track shall be 
used as noted in Test Methods A1058, 
4.1.7 Supplementary Requirements, and 
4.1.8 Additional requirements. 
5. Process 
5.1 The steel shall be made from any process. 
5.2 If a specific type of melting is required by the purchaser, 
it shall be stated on the purchase order. 
5.3 The primary melting may incorporate separate degas­
sing or refining and may be followed by secondary melting, 
using electroslag remelting or vacuum remelting. 
5.4 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When 
steel of different grades is sequentially strand cast, identifica­
tion of the resultant transition material is required. The 
producer shall remove the transition material by an established 
procedure that positively separates the grades. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 Chemical Analysis-Samples for chemical analysis and 
method of analysis shall be in accordance with Test Methods, 
Practices, and Terminology A751.

6.3 Product Analysis-Product analysis requirements and 
options, if any, are contained in the product specification. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7.1 Method of Mechanical Tests-The specimens and the 
mechanical tests required shall be made in accordance with 
Annex A2 of Test Methods and Definitions A370 if inch-pound 
units are specified, or to the requirements described in the 
applicable track of Test Methods A1058, if SI units are 
specified. 
7.2 Specimens shall be tested at room temperature. 
7.3 Small or subsize specimens as described in Test Meth­
ods and Definitions A370 or Test Methods A1058 may be used 
only when there is insufficient material to prepare one of the 
standard specimens. When using small or subsize specimens, 
the largest one possible shall be used. 
8. Tensile Requirements 
8.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in the individual specifications. 
8.2 The yield strength corresponding to a permanent offset 
of 0.2 % of the gage length or to a total extension of 0.5 % of 
the gage length under load shall be determined. 
8.3 If the percentage of elongation of any test specimen is 
less than that specified and any part of the fracture is more than 
¾ in. [19.0 mm] from the center of the gage length, as 
indicated by scribe marks on the specimen before testing, a 
retest shall be allowed. 
9. Permissible Variation in Weight 
9.1 The weight of any length of pipe NPS 12 [DN 300] and 
under shall not vary more than 10 % over or 3.5 % under that 
specified. For sizes over NPS 12 [DN 300], the weight of any 
length of pipe shall not vary more than 10 % over or 5 % under 
that specified. Unless otherwise specified, pipe of NPS 4 [DN 
100] and smaller may be weighed in convenient lots; pipe in 
sizes larger than NPS 4 [DN 100] shall be weighed separately. 
10. Permissible Variations in Wall Thickness 
----~ro;--1~seamless an e e no ller metal added)-The 
minimum wall thickness at any point shall be within the 
tolerances specified in Table 1, except that for welded pipe the

weld area shall not be limited by the over tolerance. The 
minimum wall thickness on inspection for - 12.5 % is shown 
in Table Xl.1. 
10.2 Forged and Bored-The wall thickness shall not vary 
over that specified by more than Vs in. [3.2 mm]. There shall be 
no variation under the specified wall thickness. 
10.3 Cast-The wall thickness shall not vary over that 
specified by more than V16 in. [1.6 mm]. There shall be no 
variation under the specified wall thickness. 
11. Permissible Variations in Inside Diameter 
11.1 Forged and Bored, and Cast-The inside diameter 
shall not vary under that specified by more than V16 in. [1.6 
mm]. There shall be no variation over the ·specified inside 
diameter. 
12. Permissible Variations in Outside Diameter 
12.1 Variations in outside diameter, unless otherwise 
specified, shall not exceed the limits prescribed in Table 2. The 
tolerances on outside diameter include ovality except as 
provided for in 12.2. 
12.2 Thin-wall pipe usually develops significant ovality 
(out-of-roundness) during final annealing, straightening, or 
both. The diameter tolerances of Table 2 are not sufficient to 
provide for additional ovality expected in thin-wall pipe and 
are applicable only to the mean of the extreme (maximum and 
minimum) outside diameter readings in any one cross-section. 
However, for thin-wall pipe the difference in extreme outside 
diameter readings (ovality) in any one cross-section shall not 
exceed 1.5 % of the specified outside diameter. 
13. Permissible Variations in Length 
13.1 Seamless and Welded (no filler metal added)-If defi­
nite cut lengths are ordered, no length of pipe shall be under the 
length specified and not more than ¼ in. [6 mm] over that 
specified. 
13.2 Forged and Bored, Cast, and Cast Cold-Wrought-If 
definite cut lengths are ordered, no length of pipe shall be 
length-spec-ifi-€:d-and-ne1-mere-than-¼-in:;-[-3--nnrrJuVi~----------r~ 
that specified.

13.3 For pipe ordered to random lengths, the lengths and 
variations shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and 
purchaser.

13.4 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise agreed 
upon. 
14. Standard Weight 
14.1 A system of standard pipe sizes has been approved by 
the American National Standards Institute as ASME B36.10 
and B36.19. These standard sizes do not prohibit the produc­
tion and use of other sizes of pipe produced to the various 
specifications referenced to this Specification. 
14.2 For nonstandard sizes of pipe, the calculated weight 
per foot, shall be determined from the following equation: 
W=C(D-t)t (1) 
where: 
C = 10.69 [0.0246615], 
W = weight, lb/ft [kg/m], 
D = specified or calculated (from specified inside diameter 
and wall thickness) outside diameter, in. [mm], and 
t = specified wall thickness, in. (to 3 decimal places) [mm 
to 2 decimal places]. 
Nam 2-The weights given in the American National Standards and 
the calculated weights given by Eq 1 are based on the weights for carbon 
steel pipe. The weight of pipe made of ferritic stainless steels may be 
about 5 % less, and that made of austenitic stainless steel about 2 % 
greater than the values given. 
15. Ends 
15.1 Unless otherwise specified, the pipe shall be furnished 
with plain ends. All burrs at the ends of the pipe shall be 
removed. 
16. Straightness 
16.1 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight. 
18. Retests 
18.1 If the results of the mechanical tests of any group or lot 
do not conform to the requirements specified in the individual 
specification, retests may be made on additional lengths of pipe 
of double the original number from the same group or lot, each 
of which shall conform to the requirements specified. Only one 
retest of any group or lot will be permitted. Nonconformance 
will be cause for the rejection of the group or lot. 
18.2 Any individual length of pipe that meets the test 
requirements is acceptable. Individual lengths that do not 
. conform to the test requirements may be resubmitted for test 
provided the reason for nonconformance is established and the 
nonconforming portion removed. 
19. Retreatment 
19.1 If individual lengths of pipe selected to represent any 
group or lot fail to conform to the test requirements, the group 
or lot represented may be reheat treated and resubmitted for 
test. The manufacturer may reheat treat the pipe, but not more 
than twice, except with the approval of the purchaser on the 
basis of satisfactory metallurgical evidence that the cause of 
failure of the test is curable and the quality of the material is 
satisfactory. 
20. Test Specimens 
20.1 Test specimens shall be taken from the ends of as-heat 
treated finished pipe prior to any forming operations, or being 
cut to length. They shall be smooth on the ends and free from 
burrs and flaws, except for specimens for the flattening test 
when made from crop ends. 
20.2 Specimens cut either longitudinally or transversely 
shall be acceptable for the tension test. 
20.3 If any test specimen shows flaws or defective 
machining, the specimen may be discarded and another sub­
stituted. 
21. Flattening Test Requirements 
16.2 For metal-arc welded pipe, the maximum deviation 
from a 10-ft [3.0-m] straightedge placed so that both ends are 
in contact with the pipe shall be 1/s in. [3.2 mm]. For metal-arc 
welded pipe with lengths shorter than 10 ft [3.0 m], this 
maximum deviation shall be pro-rated with respect to the ratio 
of the actual length to 10 ft [3.0 m]. 21.1 Seamless and Centrifugally Cast Pipe-A section of 
pipe not less than 2½ in. [63 mm] in length shall be flattened

product specification weld seam defects in welded pipe, shall 
be permitted subject to the approval of the purchaser and with 
the further understanding that the composition of the deposited 
filler metal shall be suitable for the composition being welded. 
Defects shall be thoroughly chipped or ground out before 
welding and each repaired length shall be reheat treated or 
stress relieved as required by the applicable specification. Each 
length of repaired pipe shall be tested hydrostatically as 
required by the product specification. 
17 .2 Repair welding shall be performed using procedures 
and welders or welding operators that have been qualified in 
accordance with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
Section IX.

H= (1 + e)tl(e + t/D) (2) 
where: 
H = distance between flattening plates, in. [mm], 
t = specified wall thickness, in. [mm], 
D = specified or calculated (from the specified inside diam­
eter and wall thickness) outside diameter, in. [mm], and 
e = deformation per unit length ( constant for a given grade 
of steel; 0.07 for medium carbon steel (maximum 
specified carbon 0.19 % or greater), 0.08 for ferritic 
alloy steel, 0.09 for austenitic steel, and 0.09 for 
low-carbon steel (maximum specified carbon 0.18 % or 
less)).

During the second step, which is a test for soundness, the 
flattening shall be continued untii' the specimen breaks or the 
opposite walls of the pipe meet. 
21.2 Welded Pipe-A section of welded pipe not less than 4 
in. [100 mm] in length shall be flattened cold between parallel 
plates in two steps. The weld shall be placed 90° from the 
direction of the applied force (at the point of maximum 
bending). During the first step, which is a test for ductility, no 
cracks or breaks on the inside or outside surfaces, except as 
provided for in 21.3.4, shall occur until the distance between 
the plates is less than the value of H calculated by Eq 2. During 
the second step, which is a test for soundness, the flattening 
shall be continued until the specimen breaks or the opposite 
walls of the pipe meet. 
21.3 Seamless, Centrifugally Cast, and Welded Pipe: 
21.3.1 Evidence of laminated or defective material or weld 
that is revealed during the entire flattening test shall be cause 
for rejection. 
21.3.2 Surface imperfections not evident in the test speci­
men before flattening, but revealed during the first step of the 
flattening test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish 
requirements. 
21.3.3 Superficial ruptures resulting from surface imperfec­
tions shall not be a cause for rejection. 
21.3.4 When low D-to-t ratio tubular products are tested, 
because the strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably 
high on the inside surface at the six and twelve o'clock 
locations, cracks at these locations shall not be cause for 
rejection if the D to t ratio is less than 10. 
22. Hydrostatic Test Requirements 
22.1 Except as provided in 22.2 and 22.3, each length of 
pipe shall be tested by the manufacturer to a hydrostatic 
pressure which will produce in the pipe wall a stress not less 
than 60 % of the minimum specified yield strength for carbon 
and ferritic alloy steel pipe, or 50 % of the specified minimum 
yield strength for austenitic alloy steel pipe. The test pressure 
or stress shall be determined by the following equation: 
P = 2St/D or S = PD/2t (3) 
22.2 Regardless of pipe-wall stress-level determined by Eq 
3, the minimum hydrostatic test pressure required to satisfy 
these requirements need not exceed 2500 psi [17.0 MPa] for 
outside diameters (see Din 22.1) of 3.5 in. [88.9 mm] or less, 
nor 2800 psi [19.0 MPa] for outside diameters over 3.5 in. 
[88.9 mm]. This does not prohibit testing at higher pressures at 
the manufacturer's option or as provided in 22.3. 
22.3 With concurrence of the manufacturer, a minimum 
hydrostatic test pressure in excess of the requirements of 22.2 
or 22.1, or both, may be stated on the order. 
22.4 The test pressure shall be held for a minimum of 5 s, 
without resultant leakage through the pipe wall. For welded 
pipe, the test pressure shall be held for a time sufficient to 
permit the inspector to examine the entire length of the welded 
seam. 
22.5 The hydrostatic test may not be capable of inspecting 
the end portion of the pipe. The length of pipe that cannot be 
tested shall be determined by the manufacturer and, when 
specified in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
23. Material Test Report 
23.1 The producer or supplier shall furnish a material test 
report certifying that the material was manufactured, sampled, 
tested and inspected in accordance with the specification, 
including year date, the supplementary requirements, and any 
other requirements designated in the purchase order or 
contract, and that the results met the requirements of that 
specification, the supplementary requirements and the other 
requirements. A signature or notarization is not required on the 
material test report, but the document shall be dated and shall 
clearly identify the organization submitting the report. Not­
withstanding the absence of a signature or notarization, the 
organization submitting the report is responsible for the con­
tents of the report. 
23.2 In addition, the material test report shall include the 
following information and test results, when applicable: 
23.2.1 Heat Number, 
23.2.2 Heat Analysis,

of the specification have not been completed. The purchaser 
must certify that all requirements of the specification have been 
completed before removal of the letter (that is, X, Y, or Z). 
23.5 When certification is required for material that has not 
been hydrostatically tested, the certificate of test shall state 
"Not hydrostatically tested", and the letters "NH" shall be 
appended to the product specification number, material grade 
and class shown on the certificate. 
23.6 A material test report, certificate of compliance, or 
similar document printed from or used in electronic form from 
an electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission shall be 
regarded as having the same validity as a counterpart printed in 
the certifier's facility. The content of the EDI transmitted 
document shall meet the requirements of the invoked ASTM 
standard(s) and conform to any existing EDI agreement be­
tween the purchaser and supplier. Notwithstanding the absence 
of a signature, the organization submitting the EDI transmis­
sion is responsible for the content of the material test report. 
24. Inspection 
24.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry at all times while work on the contract of the purchaser 
is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's works 
that concern the manufacture of the material ordered. The 
manufacturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities 
to satisfy him that the material is being furnished in accordance 
with this specification. All required tests and inspection shall 
be made at the place of manufacture prior to shipment, unless 
otherwise specified, and shall be conducted so as not to 
interfere unnecessarily with operation of the works. 
26.3 For anstenitic steel pipe, the marking paint or ink shall 
not contain any harmful metal, or metal salts, such as zinc, 
lead, or copper, which cause corrosive attack on heating. 
26.4 Pipes which have been weld repaired in accordance 
with 17.1 shall be marked WR. 
26.5 When it is specified that certain requirements of a 
specification adopted by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Committee are to be completed by the purchaser upon receipt 
of the material, the manufacturer shall indicate that all require­
ments of the specification have not been completed by a letter 
such as X, Y, or Z, immediately following the specification 
number. This letter may be removed after completion of all 
requirements in accordance with the specification. An expla­
nation of specification requirements to be completed is pro­
vided in 25.1. 
26.6 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 26.1, 
26.2, 26.3, 26.4 and 26.5, bar coding is acceptable as a 
supplemental identification method. The purchaser may 
specify in the order a specific bar coding system to be used. 
27. Packaging, Marking, and Loading 
27.1 When specified on the purchase order, packaging, 
marking, and loading for shipment shall be in accordance with 
the procedures of Practices A 700.

conformance to requirements, however, this does not authorize 
submission of known defective material, either indicated or 
actual, nor does it commit the Government to accept the 
material. Except as otherwise specified in the contract or 
purchase order, the manufacturer may use his own or any other 
suitable facilities for the performance of the inspection and test 
requirements unless disapproved by the purchaser at the time 
the order is placed. The purchaser shall have the right to 
perform any of the inspections and tests set forth when such 
inspections and tests are deemed necessary to ensure that the 
material conforms to the prescribed requirements. 
28.1.3 Sampling for Flattening and Flaring Test and for 
Visual and Dimensional Examination-Minimum sampling for

chemical analysis shall be selected from each of two pipes 
chosen from each lot. A lot shall be all material poured from 
one heat. 
28.1.5 Sampling for Tension and Bend Test-One sample 
shall be taken from each lot. A lot shall consist of all pipe of the 
same outside diameter and wall thickness manufactured during 
an 8-h shift from the same heat of steel, and heat treated under 
the same conditions of temperature and time in a single charge 
in a batch type furnace, or heat treated under the same 
condition in a continuous furnace, and presented for inspection 
at the same time. 
28.1.6 Hydrostatic and Ultrasonic Tests-Each pipe shall be 
tested by the ultrasonic (when specified) and hydrostatic tests. 
28.1.7 Pipe shall be free from heavy oxide or scale. The 
internal surface of hot finished ferritic steel pipe shall be

SA-533/SA-533M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Quenched and 
Tempered, Manganese-Molybdenum and Manganese­
Molybdenum-Nickel 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers one type of manganese­
molybdenum and four types of manganese-molybdenum­
nickel alloy steel plates for use in the quenched and tempered 
condition for the construction of welded pressure vessels. 
1.2 Material under this specification is available in five 
types, designated "A", "B", "C", "D", and "E". The material is 
also available in three classes having the following strength 
levels. 
Class Tensile Strength, 
ksi [MPa] 
1 80-100 [550 to 690] 
2 90-115 [620 to 795] 
3 100-125 [690 to 860] 
1.3 The maximum thickness of Class 1 and Class 2 plates is 
limited only by the capacity of the composition to meet the 
specified mechanical property requirements; however, current 
practice normally limits the maximum thickness to 12 in. [300 
mm] for Types A through D and to 7 in. [180 mm] for Type E. 
1.4 The maximum thickness of Class 3 plates is 2½ in. [65 
mm] for Types A through D and 2 in. [50 mm] for Type E. 
1.5 The minimum nominal thickness of plates of all classes 
is 0.25 in. [6.5 mm]. 
1.6 These alloy steel plates in the as-rolled condition are 
sensitive to cracking during transit and handling, particularly in 
thicknesses over about 1 or 2 in. [25 or 50 mm]. They should 
be shipped in the as-rolled conditions only by mutual agree­
ment of manufacturer and the purchaser. 
properties may be affected by high levels of radiation. Appen­
dix Xl provides some information pertinent to this usage. 
1.8 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation.

(Nonmandatory Information) 
XI. NUCLEAR REACTOR BELTLINE CONSIDERATIONS-RESIDUAL ELEMENTS 
Xl .1 Reactor design requires review and control of residual 
elements that affect the material properties. Copper and phos­
phorus are limited to levels determined by the total fluence to 
be encountered during plant life. Vanadium and sulfur can 
affect the upper energy shelf level. In the case of sulfur, control 
of this element or its morphology in the plate, or both, may 
offer alternative means of control. The limits required shall be 
specified in the ordering data. The following table itemizes
