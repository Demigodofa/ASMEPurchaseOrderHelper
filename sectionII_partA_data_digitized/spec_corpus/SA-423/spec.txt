SA-423 /SA-423M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Seamless and Electric-Welded Low-Alloy Steel Tubes 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
low-alloy steel tubes for pressure containing parts such as 
economizers or other applications where corrosion resistance is 
important. 
1.2 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are ½ to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside 
diameter and 0.035 to 0.500 in. [0.9 to 12.7 mm] inclusive, in 
minimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may 
be furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than ¼ in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.4 This specification covers three grades, two types, and 
two manufacture finishes: 
1.4.1 Grades 1, 2, and 3 are identified in Table 1 (Chemical 
Requirements), and Table 3 (Tensile Requirements), 
1.4.2 Type (seamless or electric-resistance welded), 
1.4.3 Manufacture (hot finished or cold finished). 
1.5 Optional supplementary requirements S 1 and S2 are 
provided and, when desired, shall be so stated in the order. 
1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
708 
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

of flat-rolled stock or tubes which do not meet the requirements 
of the specification shall be rejected. 
NOTE 1-For flattening, flaring, and flange requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting of the same nominal size and wall 
thickness that are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
the same size and from the same heat which are heat treated in the same 
furnace charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace 
the number of tubes of the same size and from the same heat in a lot shall 
be determined from the size of the tubes as prescribed in Table 2. 
NoTE 2-For tensile and hardness test requirements, the term lot applies 
to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall 
thickness that are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of

SA-437 /SA-437M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Stainless and Alloy-Steel Turbine-Type Bolting Specially 
Heat Treated for High-Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers stainless and alloy-steel bolt­
ing material and bolting components specially heat treated for 
high-temperature service, such as steam turbine, gas turbine, 
and similar uses. See Specification A962/A962M for the 
definition of bolting. This material requires special processing 
and should not be used in general-purpose applications. Bolt­
ing furnished as bars shall be hot wrought and may be further 
processed by centerless grinding or by cold drawing. 
1.2 The high-temperature properties of the bolting materials 
and components covered by this specification are dependent 
upon special heat treatment, which is required. Although the 
high-temperature properties are not specified, they are implied 
by control of the chemistry, heat treatment, and room­
temperature properties of the bolting material. 
1.3 Three levels of bolting strength are covered, designated 
Grades B4B, B4C, and B4D. 
1.4 The following referenced general requirements are in­
dispensable for application of this specification: Specification 
A962/ A962M. 
1.5 Supplementary requirements are provided for use at the 
option of the purchaser. The supplementary requirements shall 
apply only when specified individually by the purchaser in the 
purchase order or contract. 
1.6 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units; however, unless the purchase order or contract 
specifies the applicable M specification designation (SI units), 
the inch-pound units shall apply. 
1. 7 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
718 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. 
2. Referenced Documents

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-437 /SA-437M 
methods, finish, thread dimensions, macroetch (Grade B4D 
only), marking, certification, optional supplementary 
requirements, and others. Failure to comply with the require­
ments of Specification A962/A962M constitutes nonconfor­
mance with this specification. In case of conflict between this 
specification and Specification A962/ A962M, this specification 
shall prevail. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 Grades B4B and B4C shall be heated to a temperature 
range of 1875 to 1925 °F [1025 to 1050 °C] and liquid 
quenched to below 600 °F [316 °C]. The material Grades B4B 
and B4C shall then be uniformly reheated for tempering at a 
tempering temperature at least 100 °F [55 °C] higher than the 
proposed operating temperature but not less than 1150 °F [620 
0 C], then air or furnace cooled to room temperature. The 
material shall be at the tempering temperature for a minimum 
of 2 h. Double tempering may be used to enhance properties. 
5.2 Grade B4D shall be heated to a temperature range of 
1700 to 1750 °F [925 to 954 °C] and oil quenched. The 
material shall then be uniformly reheated or tempered at a 
temperature of 1200 °F [650 °C] minimum, followed by air or 
furnace cooling to room temperature. 
5.3 Stress relieving treatment of the bar material is required 
after any stretcher, roller, or rotary-straightening or cold­
finishing operations performed after heat treatment for me­
chanical properties. Local gagging or press straightening to 
conect camber limitations in excess of¼ in. in any 5 ft [6 mm 
in any 1.5 m] shall be followed by a stress relieving heat 
treatment. The minimum stress relieving temperature shall be 
100 °F [55 °C] below the minimum tempering temperature as 
shown in 5.1 for Grades B4B and B4C or in 5.2 for Grade 
B4D.
