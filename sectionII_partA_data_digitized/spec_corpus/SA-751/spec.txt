Test Methods and Practices for 
Chemical Analysis of Steel Products 
INTRODUCTION 
These test methods and practices were prepared to answer the need for a single document that would 
include all aspects of obtaining and reporting the chemical analysis of steel, stainless steel, and related 
alloys. Such subjects as definitions of terms and product (check) analysis variations (tolerances) 
required clarification. Requirements for sampling, meeting specified limits, and treatment of data 
usually were not clearly established in product specifications. 
It is intended that these test methods and. practices will contain all requirements for the 
determination of chemical composition of steel, stainless steel, or related alloys so that product 
specifications will need contain only special modifications and exceptions. 
1. Scope 
1.1 These test methods and practices cover definitions, 
reference methods, practices, and guides relating to the chemi­
cal analysis of steel, stainless steel, and related alloys. They 
include both wet chemical and instrumental techniques. 
1.2 Directions are provided for handling chemical 
requirements, product analyses, residual elements, and refer­
ence standards, and for the treatment and reporting of chemical 
analysis data. 
1.3 These test methods and practices apply only to those 
product standards which include these test methods and 
practices, or parts thereof, as a requirement. 
1.4 In cases of conflict, the product specification require­
ments shall take precedence over the requirements of these test 
methods and practices. 
1.5 Attention is directed to ISO/IEC 17025 when there may 
be a need for information on criteria for evaluation of testing 
laboratories. 
1.6 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

2.2 ISO Standards: 
ISO/IEC 17025 General Requirements for the Competence 
of Testing and Calibration Laboratories 
3. Terminology 
3.l Definitions: 
3 .1.1 For definitions of terms used in these test methods and 
practices, see Terminology A941. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.1 product, check, or verification analysis, n-a chemical 
analysis of the semifinished or finished product, usually for the 
purpose of determining conformance to the specification re­
quirements. 
3.2.1.1 Discussion-The range of the specified composition 
applicable to product analysis is normally greater than that 
applicable to heat analysis in order to take into account 
deviations associated with analytical reproducibility (Note 1) 
and the heterogeneity of the steel. 
NoTE 1-All of the chemical analysis procedures referenced in these 
test methods include precision statements with reproducibility data, with 
the exception of Test Methods E50. 
3.2.2 product analysis tolerances, n-a permissible varia­
tion over the maximum limit or under the minimum limit of a 
specified element and applicable only to product analyses, not 
cast or heat analyses (Note 2). 
NoTE 2-The term "analysis tolerance" is often misunderstood. It does 
not apply to cast or heat analyses determined to show conformance to 
specified chemical limits. It applies only to product analysis and becomes 
meaningful only when the heat analysis of an element falls close to one of 
the specified limits. For example, stainless steel UNS 30400 limits for 
chromium are 18.00 to 20.00 %. A heat that the producer reported as 
18.01 % chromium may be found to show 17.80 % chromium by a user 
performing a product analysis. If the product analysis tolerance for such a 
chromium level is 0.20 %, the product analysis of 17.80 % chromium 
would be acceptable. A product analysis of 17.79 % would not be 
acceptable. 
3.2.3 proprietary analytical method, n-a non-standard ana­
lytical method, not published by ASTM, utilizing reference 
standards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST), when available, or other sources refer­
enced in Section 10. 
3.2.4 referee analysis, n-performed using ASTM test 
methods listed in 9.1.1, NIST reference standards or methods, 
and reference standards agreed upon between parties. 
3.2.4.1 Discussion-The selection of a laboratory to per­
form the referee analysis shall be a matter of agreement 
between the supplier and the purchaser. 
3.2.5 certified reference material, n-a specimen of material 
specially prepared, analyzed, and certified for chemical content 
under the jurisdiction of a recognized standardizing agency or 
group, such as the NIST, for use by analytical laboratories as an 
accurate basis for comparison. 
3.2.5.1 Discussion-Reference samples should bear suffi­
cient resemblance to the material to be analyzed so that no 
significant differences are required in procedures or corrections 
(for example, for interferences or inter-element effects). 
3.2.6 working reference materials, n-reference materials 
used for routine analytical control and traceable to NIST 
standards and other recognized standards when appropriate 
standards are available.

4. Concerning Specification of Chemical Composition 
Req1drements 
4.1 It is recommended that Guide B1282 be consulted as a 
guide for specifying the chemical compositions for steels. 
4.2 The recommended practice for specifying chemical 
composition limits is to limit the number of significant figures 
for each element so that the number of figures to the right of the 
decimal point conforms to the following: 
Chemical Concentration 
Maximum Number of 
Figures to Right of Decimal Point 
Up to 0.010 %, incl. 0.XXXX or may be expressed as ppm 
Over 0.010 % to 0.10 %, incl 0.XXX 
Over 0.1 O % to 3.0 %, incl 0.XX 
Over 3.0 % O.X 
4.3 For those cases in which the composition range spans 
either 0.10 or 3.0 %, the number of figures to the right of the 
decimal is to be determined by that indicated by the upper 
limit. 
4.4 Technical considerations may dictate the employment of 
less than the number of figures to the right of the decimal as 
previously recommended. 
NoTE 3-The recommendations should be employed to reduce the 
number of significant figures, such as from 18.00 to 18.0 %, but a 
significant figure should never be added unless there is a technical reason 
for so doing. 
5. Cast or Heat Analysis 
5.1 The producer shall perform analyses for those elements 
specified in the material specification. The results of such 
analyses shall conform to the requirements specified in the 
material specification. 
5.1.1 For multiple heats, either individual heat or cast 
analysis, or an average heat or cast analysis, shall be reported. 
If significant variations in heat or cast size are involved, a 
weighted average heat or cast analysis, based on the relative 
quantity of metal in each heat or cast, shall be reported. 
5.1.2 For consumable electrode remelted material, a heat is 
defined as all the ingots remelted by the same process from a 
primary heat. The heat analysis shall be obtained from one 
remelted ingot, or the product of one remelted ingot, from each 
primary melt. If this heat analysis does not meet the heat 
analysis requirements of the specification, one sample from the 
product of each remelted ingot shall be analyzed, and the 
analyses shall meet the heat analysis requirements. 
5.2 If the test samples taken for the heat analysis are lost, 
inadequate, or not representative of the heat, a product analysis 
of the semifinished or finished product may be used to establish 
the heat analysis. 
5.2.1 If a product analysis is made to establish the heat 
analysis, the product analysis shall meet the specified limits for 
heat analysis and the product analysis tolerances described in 
Section 6 do not apply. 
5.3 Unless otherwise specified, compositions shall be 
reported in mass fraction percent (wt%). 
6. Product Analysis Requirements 
6.1 For product analysis, the range of the specified chemical 
composition is normally greater ( designated product analysis 
tolerances) than that applicable to heat analyses to take into 
account deviations associated with analytical reproducibility 
and the heterogeneity of the steel. If several determinations of 
any element in the heat are made, they may not vary both 
above and below the specified range. 
6.2 Product analysis tolerances may not be used to deter­
mine conformance to the specified heat or cast analysis unless 
permitted by the individual material specification. 
6.3 Product analysis tolerances, where available, are given 
in the individual material specifications or in the general 
requirement specifications. 
7. Unspecified Elements (Note 4) 
7 .1 Reporting analyses of unspecified elements is permitted. 
NoTE 4--All commercial metals contain small amounts of various 
elements in addition to those which are specified. It is neither practical nor 
necessary to specify limits for every unspecified element that might be 
present, despite the fact that the presence of many of these elements is 
often routinely determined by the producer. 
7.2 Analysis limits shall be established for specific elements 
rather than groups of elements such as "all others," "rare 
earths," and "balance." 
8. Sampling 
8.1 Cast or Heat Analyses: 
8.1.1 Samples shall be taken, insofar as possible, during the 
casting of a heat, at a time which, in the producer's judgment, 
best represents the composition of the cast. 
8.1.2 In case the heat analysis samples or analyses are lost 
or inadequate, or when it is evident that the sample does not 
truly represent the heat, representative samples may be taken 
from the semifinished or finished product, in which case such 
samples may be analyzed to satisfy the specified requirements. 
The analysis shall meet the specified limits for heat analysis. 
8.2 Check, Product, or Verification Analyses-Unless other­
wise specified, the latest revision of Practice B1806 shall be 
used as a guide for sampling. 
9. Test Methods 
9.1 This section lists some test methods that have been 
found acceptable for chemical analysis of steels. 
9 .1.1 The following ASTM wet chemical test methods have 
been found acceptable as referee test methods and as a base for 
standardizing instrumental analysis techniques.

10. Reference Materials 
10.1 For referee analyses, reference standards of a recog­
nized standardizing agency shall be employed with preference 
given to NIST standard reference materials when applicable. 
(NIST does not produce reference standards suitable for all 
elements or all alloys.) 
10.1.1 When standard reference materials for certain alloys 
are not available from NIST, reference materials may be 
produced by employing ASTM standard procedures and NIST 
standard reference materials to the extent that such procedures 
and reference standards are available. Several independent 
laboratories should be used for certification of these standards 
and their results statistically reviewed and merged. 
10.1.2 Test methods not published by ASTM, such as a 
definitive analytical method, may be used when the method is 
validated by analyzing certified reference materials along with 
the candidate reference material. Examples of definitive ana­
lytical methods include gravimetric, coulometry, titrimetric 
based on normality, and mass spectrometry. 
10.2 Working reference materials may be used for routine 
analytical control. 
11. Significant Numbers 
11.1 Laboratories shall report each element to the same 
number of significant numbers as used in the pertinent material 
specifications.

4.1.5 The minimum tempering temperature shall be 1100°F 
[590°C]. 
5. Chemical Requirements 
5.1 Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam­
pling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall 
comply with Table 1. 
5.2 Product Analysis-The purchaser may use the product 
analysis provision of Specification A788/A788M to obtain a 
product analysis from a forging representing each heat or 
multiple heat. 
6. Mechanical Requirements 
6.1 General Requirements-The forgings shall conform to 
the tension test requirements of Table 2. The forgings shall also 
conform to the impact test requirements of Table 3. The largest 
obtainable round tension test specimen as specified in Test 
Methods and Definitions A370 shall be used. Impact speci­
mens shall be Charpy V-notch, Type A, as in Test Methods and 
Definitions A370. The usage of subsize impact specimens must 
have prior purchaser approval. 
6.1.1 When agreed upon between the purchaser and the 
producer and specified on the order, impact tests may be made 
at temperatures different from those shown in Table 3 provided 
the test temperature is at least as low as the intended service 
temperatures and the provided impact energy requirements of 
Table 3 are met. Such forgings shall be suitably marked in 
accordance with 9.1 to identify the test temperature. 
6.2 Test Location-Test coupons shall be taken so that the 
longitudinal axis and mid-length of tension and impact test 
specimens shall be positioned in accordance with one of the 
following methods: 
6.2.1 Method I-Forgings with 2 in. [50 mm] maximum 
thickness. The specimens shall have their longitudinal axis at 
the midthickness or the center of the cross section and with the 
midlength of the specimen at least 2 in. [50 mm] from any 
second surface. 
6.2.2 Method 2-Grade I and Grade II forgings with thick­
nesses greater than 2 in. up to 4 in. [50 to 100 mm] inclusive, 
or Grade III and IV forgings with thicknesses greater than 2 in. 
up to 6 in. [50 to 150 mm] inclusive. The specimens shall have 
their longitudinal axis at least ¼ T of maximum heat-treated 
thickness from any surface and with the midlength of the 
specimen at least one T from any second surface. This is 
normally referred to as ¼ T by T when T is the maximum 
heat-treated thickness. A thermal buffer may be used to adhere 
to the condition in 6.3. Unless otherwise agreed upon, the

Standard Specification for 
Through-Thickness Tension Testing of Steel Plates for 
Special Applications 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers the procedures and accep­
tance standards for the determination of reduction of area using 
a tension test specimen whose axis is perpendicular to the 
rolled surfaces of steel plates 1 in. [25 mm] and greater in 
thickness. The principal purpose of the testing is to provide a 
measure of the resistance of a steel plate to lamellar tearing. 
(See Appendix XL) 
1.2 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded as standard. Within the text, the SI units are 
shown in brackets. The values stated in each system are not 
exact equivalents; therefore, each system must be used inde­
pendently of the other. Combining values from the two systems 
may result in nonconformance with the specification. 
1.3 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound and 
SI unit~. However, unless the order specifies the applicable 
"M" specification designation (SI units), the material shall be 
furnished to inch-pound units. 
2. Referenced Documents 
2.l ASTM Standards: 
A370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Testing 
of Steel Products 
3. Ordering Information 
3.1 The inquiry and order shall include the following, if 
required: 
3.1.1 Supplementary requirements that are available to meet 
end use requirements (see SI through S5). 
3.1.2 Special requirements agreed upon between the manu­
facturer and the purchaser. 
4. Tension Tests 
4.1 Number of Tests: 
4.1.l Two tests shall be required from each plate-as-rolled, 
except for plates subjected to heat treatment by quenching and 
tempering. 1\vo tests shall be required from each quenched­
and-tempered plate. The tests shall be representative of the 
plate in its final condition. 
4.1.2 When plates are furnished by the manufacturer in an 
unheat-treated condition and qualified by heat-treated speci­
mens (including normalized, normalized and tempered, and 
quenched and tempered), two tests shall be required from each 
plate-as-rolled. 
NoTE 1-The term "plate-as-rolled" refers to the unit plate rolled from 
a slab or directly from an ingot. It does not refer to the condition of the 
plate. 
4.2 Location of Test Coupons-Take one test coupon at each 
end of each plate as defined in 4.1. Take the test coupons from 
the center of the plate width. 
4.3 Orientation of Test Specimens-The longitudinal axis of 
the reduced section of the test specimens shall be perpendicular 
to the rolled surface of the plate. 
4.4 Preparation of Test Specimens: 
4.4.1 Welded Prolongations-When required, join welded 
prolongations to the surface(s) of the plate being tested. The 
joining method used shall be one which results in a minimal 
heat-affected zone in the portion of the plate to be tested. 
Shielded metal arc, friction, stud, or electron-beam welding 
methods have proven to be suitable. 
4.4.2 Standard Test Specimens: 
4.4.2.1 Three types of standard round tension test specimens 
are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. For Types 1 and 2 specimens, 
locate the center of the length of the reduced section at the 
approximate mid-point of the plate thickness. For Type 3 
specimens, locate the weld fusion line of one plate surface 
within ¼ in. [6 mm] of one end of the reduced section. 
4.4.2.2 For plates from 1 in. [25 mm] to 1 ¼ in. [32 mm] 
inclusive in thickness, use either the 0.350-in. [8.75-mm] Type 
1 specimen or the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] Type 2 specimen.

thickness, use the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] Type 2 specimen. 
4.4.2.4 For plates greater than 2 in. [50 nun] in thickness, 
use the Type 3 specimen. 
4.4.3 Alternative Test Specimens-The alternative test 
specimens in Fig. 2 and Table 2 may be used in place of the 
standard specimens in Fig. 1 and Table 1. 
4.4.3.1 For plates over 2 in. [50 mm] in thickness, Type A or 
Type B specimens may be used. The Type A specimen provides 
a reduced section length greater than the plate thickness. The 
Type B specimen provides a reduced section length of 2¼ in. 
[57 mm] with its center at the mid-thickness of the plate. Over 
a minimum plate thickness determined by the specimen end 
configuration, no welded prolongations may be needed for the 
Type B specimen. For plates over 4¼ in. [108 mm] in 
thickness, the Type C specimen may be used. For plates over 6 
in. [150 mm] in thickness, a series of two or more Type A or 
Type C specimens with reduced sections of 4 in. [100 mm] or 
less may be used to cover the full thickness of the plate. The 
number of tests required will depend upon the thickness of the 
plate being tested and the reduced section length selected.

4.4.3.2 For plates over 1 in. [25 mm] in thickness, a series 
of button-head specimens shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2 may be 
used. The test specimen type to be used, Type D, Type E, or 
Type F, is determined by the nominal plate thickness as 
described in Table 2. A series of two or more Type F specimens 
may be used to cover the full thickness of the plate. The length 
of the reduced section (A), as shown in Fig. 2 and specified in 
Table 2, is the length of the reduced section excluding the 
machined radius (R). Within the plate thickness dimension 
specified for each test specimen type, either the button-head 
thickness, the reduced section length, or the machined radius 
may be varied. In all cases, the minimum length of the reduced 
section must be as specified in Table 2 to maintain a minimum 
length to diameter ratio (see Appendix X2.2). 
5. Acceptance Standards 
5.1 Each tension test shall have a minimum reduction of 
area no less than 20 %. If the reduction of area of both tests is 
less than 20 %, no retest shall be permitted. If the reduction of 
area of one of the two tests from a plate is less than 20 %, one 
retest of two additional specimens taken from a location 
adjacent to the specimen that failed may be made, and both of 
these additional specimens shall have a reduction of area of 
20 % or more.

(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. LAMELLAR TEARING ADJACENT TO WELDS 
XU Introduction 
Xl.1.1 Lamellar tearing is a particular type of cracking that 
occurs under the weld of a steel plate weldment. It is generally 
caused by strain induced in the thickness direction resulting 
from shrinkage of the weld deposit and by the restraint 
imposed by the components that comprise the weldment. High 
restraint increases the possibility of lamellar tearing. However, 
lamellar tearing is not solely confined to highly restrained 
weldments. Lamellar tearing may also result from loads on the 
plate surface. 
Xl.2 Characteristics of Lamellar Tearing 
Xl.2.1 Lamellar tearing normally occurs in susceptible 
material underneath the weld, in a direction generally parallel 
1248

=== Page 1315 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-770/SA-770M 
to the plate surface and often slightly outside the heat-affected 
zone. Lamellar tearing generally has a step-like appearance 
consisting of "terraces" (cracks running parallel to the plate 
surface) and "walls" (cracks which connect the individual 
terraces). The tearing may remain completely subsurface or 
appear at plate edges or at weld toes. 
Xl.3 Inclusions 
Xl.3.1 The step-like cracking characteristic of lamellar 
tearing is usually considered to result from small elongated 
nonmetallic inclusions that are normally present in the steel. 
Strains in the through-thickness direction can cause individual 
inclusions to fractures or decohere from the surrounding steel 
matrix, thus initiating a void. Further strain can cause the 
remaining metallic ligaments to shear or rupture, resulting in 
the step-like fracture appearance. 
Xl.3.2 A high or concentrated inclusion content in the steel 
produces planar regions of poor ductility parallel to the steel 
surface. On the other hand, a reduction in the magnitude and 
concentration of these inclusions to a low level tends to 
preclude any easy fracture path along the low ductility inclu­
sions and the steel exhibits improved ductility in a through­
thickness direction. 
Xl.3.3 The extent of nonmetallic inclusions depends on the 
type of steel. In silicon semikilled or fully killed steels, these 
inclusions are primatily oxides (present as silicates) and 
sulfides (present as manganese sulfides). For aluminum-silicon 
killed steels, these inclusions are primarily sulfides (manganese 
sulfides). To improve the through-thickness ductility and thus 
the resistance of the steel to lamellar tearing, it is necessary to 
reduce the level of the nonmetallic inclusions. To provide a 
high resistance to lamellar tearing may require the use of 
special steel-making processes that can reduce the oxygen and 
sulfur contents in the steel to very low levels. 
Xl.4 Steel Manufacturing Processes 
Xl.4.1 Special steel-making processes are available for 
improving the through-thickness ductility. The more common 
processes, used singly or in combination, are: (J) low sulfur 
practices; (2) inclusion shape control; (3) electroslag or 
vacuum arc remelting; atld (4) vacuum degassing. The steel­
making processes are not all intended for the same purpose, but 
will improve the through-thickness ductility to various degrees 
depending on the process used. 
Xl.5 Through-Thickness Ductility Requirements 
Xl.5.1 Susceptibility to lamellar tearing depends on many 
factors (for example, restraint, welding conditions, etc.) and, 
consequently a specific through-thickness ductility require­
ment does not provide a guarantee against lamellar tearing. The 
most widely accepted method of measuring the material 
ductility factor of susceptibility to lamellar tearing is the 
reduction of area of a round tension test specimen oriented 
perpendicular to the rolled surface of a plate. 
X2. TESTING PARAMETERS AFFECTING REDUCTION OF AREA VALUES 
X2.1 Variability of Through-Thickness Properties 
X2.1.1 Through-thickness tension test results, and in par­
ticular the reduction of area determination as provided for in 
this specification, are subject to substantially greater scatter 
than would normally be expected from standard tension tests of 
a plate in the longitudinal or transverse direction. This scatter 
of test results is due in part to the inherent variability of the 
distribution of the nonmetallic inclusions discussed in Xl.3. 
For example, those nonmetallic inclusions that form during the 
solidification phase of the steelmaking process tend to occur 
with a higher frequency in the area of final solidification. 
X2.l.2 Test specimen design may also have an effect on the 
test results. Some of these factors are discussed in X2.2. 
Operator technique will also be a factor in increasing scatter, 
particularly in the measurement of the final diameter of the test 
specimen. Because of the effect of inclusions on the fracture 
process, the appearance of the final fracture may be quite 
different than the classical cup-cone fractures common to 
longitudinal and transverse tension testing. For those materials 
with approximately 20 % reducti.on of area, the final diatneter 
measurement may require a substantial amount of judgment on 
the part of the test operator. 
X2.1.3 In view of the potential variability of the through­
thickness reduction of area test results, it is recognized that two 
tests per plate are not sufficient to fully characterize the 
through-thickness ductility of that plate. The number of tests 
and test positions have not been established that would provide 
a good estimate of both the meat1 and the variability of 
through-thickness tensile reduction of values of a plate. There­
fore, an average value requirement is not included in this 
specification. The intent of this specification is to qualify a 
plate according to the described testing procedures using only 
a minimum value requirement. The potential variability of the 
test results also increases the possibility that subsequent testing 
of a steel plate qualified according to this specification may 
produce results that do not meet the specified acceptance 
standard. 
X2.2 Effects of Test Specimen Design 
X2.2.1 Two main factors considered in the selection of test 
specimen geometry were the diameter and the slenderness 
ratio. It is generally accepted that there is a diameter effect on 
reduction-of-area values such that a smaller diameter specimen 
generally yields a higher average reduction in area value. It is 
also accepted that smaller diameter test specimens will tend to 
give greater variability to the resulting reduction in area values. 
Because these relationships between the test specimen diam­
eter and the average and variability of the test result have not 
been satisfactorily quantified at this time, the same minimum 
requirement has been applied to all test specimen diameters. 
X2.2.2 The slenderness ratio (reduced section length/ 
reduced section diameter) is lmown to affect the reduction in 
1249

=== Page 1316 ===

SA-770/SA-770M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
area values when below a minimum value. This minimum 
value may be from 1.5 to 2.5, depending on the material. 
Below this minimum value, the reduction at the failure point in 
the reduced section is restrained by the larger cross section 
away from the reduced section. A minimum slenderness ratio 
of 2 was selected for the standard Type 2 specimen to allow a 
0.500-in. (12.5-mm] diameter specimen to be used on a 1-in. 
[25-mm] plate. A minimum slenderness ratio of 2.5 was 
selected for the collar-button specimens (Types D, E, and F) to 
ensure that this effect is minimized for these test specimens.

between the purchaser and producer except that during 
production heat treatment, no portion of the furnace shall 
be below the minimum specified temperature nor above 
the maximum specified temperature for the grade being 
processed. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Chemical Analysis - Chemical analysis of materi­
als covered by this specification shall be in accordance 
with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A 751. 
5.2 Heat Analysis - An analysis of each heat shall be 
made by the manufacturer to determine the percentages of 
1253

=== Page 1320 ===

SA-781/SA-781M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
the elements specified in the individual specification for 
the grade being poured. The analysis shall be made from 
a test sample preferably taken during the pouring of the 
heat. When drillings are used, they shall be taken not less 
than ¼ in. [6.4 mm] beneath the surface. The chemical 
composition thus determined shall conform to the require­
ments in the individual specification for the grade being 
poured. 
5.3 Product Analysis - A product analysis may be 
made by the purchaser from material representing each 
heat, lot, or casting. The analysis shall be made on represen­
tative material. Samples for carbon analysis of carbon and 
alloy steel shall be taken no closer than ¼ in. [6 mm] to 
a cast surface, except that castings too thin for this shall 
be analyzed on representative material. The chemical com­
position thus determined shall meetthe requirements speci­
fied in the applicable specification for the grade involved, 
or shall be subject to rejection by the purchaser, except 
that the chemical composition determined for carbon and 
low alloy steel castings may vary from the specified limits 
by the amounts shown in Table 1. The product analysis 
tolerances of Table 1 are not applicable as acceptance 
criteria for heat analysis by the casting manufacturer. When 
comparing product and heat analysis for other than carbon 
and low alloy steels, the reproducibility Data R 2 , in Test 
Methods E 353 or E 354, as applicable, shall be taken into 
consideration. 
5.4 Unspecified Elements - When chemical analysis 
for elements not specified for the grade ordered is desired, 
Supplementary Requirement S13 may be specified. 
5.4.1 Grade substitution, for stainless steel or nickel 
base alloy castings, is not permitted. Grade substitution 
occurs when the material supplied: 
( 1) contains an element, other than nitrogen, that is not 
specified in the ordered grade; and, 
(2) the amount of that element equals or exceeds the 
minimum requirement for the element in another grade for 
which it is specified. 
For this requirement, a grade is defined as an alloy 
described individually in a table of chemical requirements 
within any specification listed within the scope of 
A 781/A 781M. 
6. Mechanical Test Requirements 
6.1 The individual product specifications vary as to 
whether mechanical tests are required; for this reason, and 
to determine specific test requirements, the individual prod­
uct specification should be reviewed. 
6.2 Unless otherwise specified by the purchaser, when 
mechanical properties are required by the product specifi­
cation, test coupons may be cast integrally with the cast­
ings, or as separate blocks, in accordance with Fig. 1, 
Fig. 2, or Fig. 3, except when Supplementary Requirement 
S 15 is specified. The test coupon in Fig. 3 shall be 
employed only for austenitic alloy castings with cross sec­
tions less than 2½, in. [65 mm]. 
7. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
7.1 All castings shall be made in a workmanlike manner 
and shall conform to the dimensions on drawings furnished 
by the purchaser before manufacture is started. If the pat­
tern is supplied by the purchaser, the dimensions of the 
casting shall be as predicated by the pattern. 
8. Quality 
8.1 The surface of the casting shall be free of adhering 
sand, scale, cracks, and hot tears as determined by visual 
examination. Other surface discontinuities shall meet the 
visual acceptance standards specified in the order. Practice 
A 802/ A 802M or other visual standards may be used to 
define acceptable surface discontinuities and finish. Unac­
ceptable visual surface discontinuities shall be removed 
and their removal verified by visual examination of the 
resultant cavities. 
8.2 When additional inspection is desired, Supplemen­
tary Requirements Sl, S2, S3, S4, or S5 may be specified. 
8.3 Rejectable indications shall not be peened, plugged, 
or impregnated. 
9. Repair 
9.1 Repair by welding shall be in accordance with the 
requirements of the individual specification using proce­
dures and welders qualified in accordance with Practice 
A 488 / A 488M. 
10. • Inspection 
10.1 The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's 
inspector all reasonable facilities necessary to satisfy that 
the material is being produced and furnished in accordance 
with the applicable specification. Foundry inspection by 
the purchaser shall not interfere unnecessarily with the 
manufacturer's operations. All tests and inspections, with 
the exception of product analysis (5.3), shall be made at 
the place of manufacture unless otherwise agreed. 
11. Rejection 
11.1 Subsequent to acceptance at the manufacturer's 
works, material that is found to be unacceptable as deter­
mined by requirements specified in the order may be 
rejected by the purchaser. The manufacturer should be 
notified of such rejection. If the manufacturer is dissatisfied 
with the results of any tests performed by the purchaser, 
he may make claim for a rehearing.

the riser at the top is therefore dependent 
on the amount of taper added to the riser. 
Use of and size is at the option of the foundry. 
The minimum height of the riser shall be 2 in.

A The range denotes the composition limits up to which tolerances are computed by the equation, and 
above which the tolerances are given by a constant. 
8 The subscript L for the elements in each equation indicates that the limits of the element specified by 
the applicable specification are to be inserted into the equation to calculate the tolerance for the upper 
limit and the lower limit (if applicable), respectively. Examples of computing tolerances are presented in 
footnote C. 
c To illustrate the computation of the tolerance, consider the manganese maximum of 0.70 for an 0.30 
carbon grade 65-35 in Specification A 27/A 27M. The maximum permissible deviation is (0.08 x 0.70 + 
0.01) = 0.066 .. Therefore, the highest acceptable product analysis is 0.766. Similarly, for a 0.20 carbon 
grade 70-40 in· Specification A 27/A 27M, the maximum manganese content is 1.40; thus, the highest 
acceptable product analysis is (1.40 + 0.09) = 1.49.

APPENDIXES 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. ALLOY DESIGNATIONS FOR CAST 
STAINLESS STEELS 
Xl.1 Cast stainless steels are usually specified on the 
basis of composition using the alloy designation system 
established by the Alloy Casting Institute (ACI). The ACI 
designations, for example, CF8M, have been adopted by 
ASTM and are preferred for cast alloys over the designa­
tions used by the American Iron and Steel Institute for 
similar wrought steels. 
Xl.2 This nomenclature system has served successfully 
to accommodate changes in old alloys and to designate 
new ones.

Carbon Content Number------~ 
Special Elements Letter III 
Xl.2.1 Service Classification Letter - The first letter 
of the cast stainless steel designation system identifies the 
intended service application of the alloy. The letter Cindi­
cates corrosion-resistant service, and the letter H indicates 
the heat-resistant service at and above 1200°F [649°C]. 
Xl.2.2 Ternary Diagram Location Letter- The second 
letter indicates the approximate location of the nickel and 
chromium contents of the alloy grade on the FeCrNi ternary 
diagram shown in Fig. Xl.1. 
Xl.2.3 Carbon Content Number- For C service classi­
fications, this single or dual digit numeral represents the 
maximum carbon content in units of 0.01 %. For H service 
classifications, this number represents the midpoint of the 
range of carbon content in terms of 0.01 % with a 
±0.05% limit. 
Xl.2.4 Special Elements Letter-Additional letters fol­
lowing the numeral represent special chemical elements in 
the alloy grade, such as M for molybdenum, C for colum­
bium, Cu for copper, W for tungsten. There are two excep­
tions; the letter A indicates Controlled Ferrite, and the 
letter F indicates Free Machining. 
Xl.3 In Fig. Xl.1, unlettered Ni-Cr ranges are associ­
ated with the nearest lettered location. They may be the 
result of differences between corrosion and heat-resistant 
types, or because of the influence of additional elements, 
for example, the precipitation hardening grade CB- 7Cu-1 
and CB-7Cu-2.

X2.1 Table X2.1 is provided for the user of the above 
listed specifications as an aid in selecting cast alloys that 
are similar in chemical composition to wrought alloys. It 
is not intended to imply that the cast alloy would have the 
same mechanical, physical or corrosion properties as the 
indicated wrought alloy.

Resolved Notes (AI-verified)
NOTE 1 (page 1305)
NoTE 1-All of the chemical analysis procedures referenced in these 
test methods include precision statements with reproducibility data, with 
the exception of Test Methods E50. 
3.2.2 product analysis tolerances, n-a permissible varia­
tion over the maximum limit or under the minimum limit of a 
specified element and applicable only to product analyses, not 
cast or heat analyses (Note 2).

NOTE 1 (page 1312)
NoTE 1-The term "plate-as-rolled" refers to the unit plate rolled from 
a slab or directly from an ingot. It does not refer to the condition of the 
plate. 
4.2 Location of Test Coupons-Take one test coupon at each 
end of each plate as defined in 4.1. Take the test coupons from 
the center of the plate width. 
4.3 Orientation of Test Specimens-The longitudinal axis of 
the reduced section of the test specimens shall be perpendicular 
to the rolled surface of the plate. 
4.4 Preparation of Test Specimens: 
4.4.1 Welded Prolongations-When required, join welded 
prolongations to the surface(s) of the plate being tested. The 
joining method used shall be one which results in a minimal 
heat-affected zone in the portion of the plate to be tested. 
Shielded metal arc, friction, stud, or electron-beam welding 
methods have proven to be suitable. 
4.4.2 Standard Test Specimens: 
4.4.2.1 Three types of standard round tension test specimens 
are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. For Types 1 and 2 specimens, 
locate the center of the length of the reduced section at the 
approximate mid-point of the plate thickness. For Type 3 
specimens, locate the weld fusion line of one plate surface 
within ¼ in. [6 mm] of one end of the reduced section. 
4.4.2.2 For plates from 1 in. [25 mm] to 1 ¼ in. [32 mm] 
inclusive in thickness, use either the 0.350-in. [8.75-mm] Type 
1 specimen or the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] Type 2 specimen.

NOTE 1 (page 1313)
NoTE 1-For Type 3 only one welded prolongation may be needed, 
depending upon plate thickness.

4.4.2.3 For plates over 1 ¼ in. to 2 in. [50 mm] inclusive in 
thickness, use the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] Type 2 specimen. 
4.4.2.4 For plates greater than 2 in. [50 nun] in thickness, 
use the Type 3 specimen. 
4.4.3 Alternative Test Specimens-The alternative test 
specimens in Fig. 2 and Table 2 may be used in place of the 
standard specimens in Fig. 1 and Table 1. 
4.4.3.1 For plates over 2 in. [50 mm] in thickness, Type A or 
Type B specimens may be used. The Type A specimen provides 
a reduced section length greater than the plate thickness. The 
Type B specimen provides a reduced section length of 2¼ in. 
[57 mm] with its center at the mid-thickness of the plate. Over 
a minimum plate thickness determined by the specimen end 
configuration, no welded prolongations may be needed for the 
Type B specimen. For plates over 4¼ in. [108 mm] in 
thickness, the Type C specimen may be used. For plates over 6 
in. [150 mm] in thickness, a series of two or more Type A or 
Type C specimens with reduced sections of 4 in. [100 mm] or 
less may be used to cover the full thickness of the plate. The 
number of tests required will depend upon the thickness of the 
plate being tested and the reduced section length selected.

4.4.3.2 For plates over 1 in. [25 mm] in thickness, a series 
of button-head specimens shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2 may be 
used. The test specimen type to be used, Type D, Type E, or 
Type F, is determined by the nominal plate thickness as 
described in Table 2. A series of two or more Type F specimens 
may be used to cover the full thickness of the plate. The length 
of the reduced section (A), as shown in Fig. 2 and specified in 
Table 2, is the length of the reduced section excluding the 
machined radius (R). Within the plate thickness dimension 
specified for each test specimen type, either the button-head 
thickness, the reduced section length, or the machined radius 
may be varied. In all cases, the minimum length of the reduced 
section must be as specified in Table 2 to maintain a minimum 
length to diameter ratio (see Appendix X2.2). 
5. Acceptance Standards 
5.1 Each tension test shall have a minimum reduction of 
area no less than 20 %. If the reduction of area of both tests is 
less than 20 %, no retest shall be permitted. If the reduction of 
area of one of the two tests from a plate is less than 20 %, one 
retest of two additional specimens taken from a location 
adjacent to the specimen that failed may be made, and both of 
these additional specimens shall have a reduction of area of 
20 % or more.

NOTE 2 (page 1305)
NoTE 2-The term "analysis tolerance" is often misunderstood. It does 
not apply to cast or heat analyses determined to show conformance to 
specified chemical limits. It applies only to product analysis and becomes 
meaningful only when the heat analysis of an element falls close to one of 
the specified limits. For example, stainless steel UNS 30400 limits for 
chromium are 18.00 to 20.00 %. A heat that the producer reported as 
18.01 % chromium may be found to show 17.80 % chromium by a user 
performing a product analysis. If the product analysis tolerance for such a 
chromium level is 0.20 %, the product analysis of 17.80 % chromium 
would be acceptable. A product analysis of 17.79 % would not be 
acceptable. 
3.2.3 proprietary analytical method, n-a non-standard ana­
lytical method, not published by ASTM, utilizing reference 
standards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST), when available, or other sources refer­
enced in Section 10. 
3.2.4 referee analysis, n-performed using ASTM test 
methods listed in 9.1.1, NIST reference standards or methods, 
and reference standards agreed upon between parties. 
3.2.4.1 Discussion-The selection of a laboratory to per­
form the referee analysis shall be a matter of agreement 
between the supplier and the purchaser. 
3.2.5 certified reference material, n-a specimen of material 
specially prepared, analyzed, and certified for chemical content 
under the jurisdiction of a recognized standardizing agency or 
group, such as the NIST, for use by analytical laboratories as an 
accurate basis for comparison. 
3.2.5.1 Discussion-Reference samples should bear suffi­
cient resemblance to the material to be analyzed so that no 
significant differences are required in procedures or corrections 
(for example, for interferences or inter-element effects). 
3.2.6 working reference materials, n-reference materials 
used for routine analytical control and traceable to NIST 
standards and other recognized standards when appropriate 
standards are available.
