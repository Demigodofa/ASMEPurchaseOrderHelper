SA-106/SA-106M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Seamless Carbon Steel Pipe for High-Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers seamless carbon steel pipe for 
high-temperature service (Note 1) in NPS Vs to NPS 48 [DN 6 
to DN 1200] (Note 2) inclusive, with nominal (average) wall 
thickness as given in ASME B 36.lOM. It shall be permissible 
to furnish pipe having other dimensions provided such pipe 
complies with all other requirements of this specification. Pipe 
ordered under this specification shall be suitable for bending, 
flanging, and similar forming operations, and for welding. 
When the steel is to be welded, it is presupposed that a welding 
procedure suitable to the grade of steel and intended use or 
service will be utilized. 
Norn 1-It is suggested, consideration be given to possible graphitiza­
tion. 
Norn 2-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) [DN 
(diameter nominal)] has been substituted in this standard for such 
traditional terms as "nominal diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
1.2 Supplementary requirements of an optional nature are 
provided for seamless pipe intended for use in applications 
where a superior grade of pipe is required. These supplemen­
tary requirements call for additional tests to be made and when 
desired shall be so stated in the order. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.4 The following precautionary caveat pertains only to the 
test method portion, Sections 11, 12, and 13 of this specifica­
tion: This standard does not purport to address all of the safety 
concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility 
of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, 
health, and environmental practices and determine the appli­
cability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
170 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

shall be used.), and 
U specified tensile strength, psi [MPa]. 
without developing cracks. When ordered for close coiling, the 
pipe shall stand being bent cold through 180° around a 
cylindrical mandrel, the diameter of which is eight times the 
outside diameter (as shown in ASME B 36.lOM) of the pipe, 
without failure. 
11.2 For pipe whose diameter exceeds 25 in. [635 mm] and 
whose diameter to wall thickness ratio, where the diameter to 
wall thickness ratio is the specified outside diameter divided by 
the nominal wall thickness, is 7 .0 or less, the bend test shall be 
conducted. The bend test specimens shall be bent at room 
temperature through 180° with the inside diameter of the bend 
being 1 in. [25 mm] without cracking on the outside portion of 
the bent portion. 
Example: For 28 in. [711 mm] diameter 5.000 in. [127 mm] 
thick pipe the diameter to wall thickness ratio = 28/5 = 5.6 
[711/127 = 5.6]. 
12. Flattening Tests 
12.1 Although testing is not required, pipe shall be capable 
of meeting the flattening test requirements of Supplementary 
Requirement S3, if tested. 
13. Hydrostatic Test 
13.1 Except as allowed by 13.2, 13.3, and 13.4, each length 
of pipe shall be subjected to the hydrostatic test without 
leakage through the pipe wall. 
13.2 As an alternative to the hydrostatic test at the option of 
the manufacturer or where specified in the purchase order, it 
shall be permissible for the full body of each pipe to be tested 
with a nondestructive electric test described in Section 14. 
13.3 Where specified in the purchase order, it shall be 
permissible for pipe to be furnished without the hydrostatic test 
and without the nondestructive electric test in Section 14; in 
172 
this case, each length so furnished shall include the mandatory 
marking of the letters "NH." It shall be permissible for pipe 
meeting the requirements of 13.1 or 13.2 to be furnished where 
pipe without either the hydrostatic or nondestructive electric 
test has been specified in the purchase order; in this case, such 
pipe need not be marked with the letters "NH." Pipe that has 
failed either the hydrostatic test of 13.1 or the nondestructive 
electric test of 13.2 shall not be furnished as "NH" pipe. 
13.4 Where the hydrostatic test and the nondestructive 
electric test are omitted and the lengths marked with the letters 
"NH," the certification, where required, shall clearly state "Not 
Hydrostatically Tested," and the letters "NH" shall be ap­
pended to the product specification number and material grade 
shown on the certification. 
14. Nondestructive Electric Test 
14.1 As an alternative to the hydrostatic test at the option of 
the manufacturer or where specified in the purchase order as an 
alternative or addition to the hydrostatic test, the full body of 
each pipe shall be tested with a nondestructive electric test in 
accordance with Practice E213, E309, or E570. In such cases, 
the marking of each length of pipe so furnished shall include 
the letters "NOE." It is the intent of this nondestructive electric 
test to reject pipe with imperfections that produce test signals 
equal to or greater than that produced by the applicable 
calibration standard. 
14.2 Where the nondestructive electric test is performed, the 
lengths shall be marked with the letters "NOE." The 
certification, where required, shall state "Nondestructive Elec­
tric Tested" and shall indicate which of the tests was applied. 
Also, the letters "NDE" shall be appended to the product 
specification number and material grade shown on the certifi­
cation.

14.3 The following information is for the benefit of the user 
of this specification: 
14.3.1 The reference standards defined in 14.4 through 14.6 
are convenient. standards for calibration of nondestructive 
testing equipment. The dimensions of such standards are not to 
be construed as the minimum sizes of imperfections detectable 
by such equipment. 
14.3.2 The ultrasonic testing referred to in this specification 
is capable of detecting the presence and location of significant 
longitudinally or circumferentially oriented imperfections; 
however, different techniques need to be employed for the 
detection of such differently oriented imperfections. Ultrasonic 
testing is not necessarily capable of detecting short, deep 
imperfections. 
14.3.3 The eddy current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
imperfections, especially of the short abrupt type. 
14.3.4 The flux leakage examination referred to in this 
specification is capable of detecting the presence and location 
of significant longitudinally or transversely oriented imperfec­
tions; however, different techniques need to be employed for 
the detection of such differently oriented imperfections. 
14.3.5 The hydrostatic test referred to in Section 13 has the 
capability of finding defects of a size permitting the test fluid 
to leak through the tube wall and may be either visually seen 
or detected by a loss of pressure. Hydrostatic testing is not 
necessarily capable of detecting very tight, through-the-wall 
impe1fections or imperfections that extend an appreciable 
distance into the wall without complete penetration. 
14.3.6 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can 
be detected in the specific applications of these examinations is 
directed to discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
14.4 For ultrasonic testing, the calibration reference notches 
shall be, at the option of the producer, any one of the three 
common notch shapes shown in Practice E213. The depth of 
notch shall not exceed 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of 
the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. 
14.5 For eddy current testing, the calibration pipe shall 
contain, at the option of the producer, any one of the following 
discontinuities to establish a minimum sensitivity level for 
rejection: 
14.5.1 Drilled Hole-The calibration pipe shall contain 
depending upon the pipe diameter three holes spaced 120° 
apart or four holes spaced 90° apart and sufficiently separated 
longitudinally to ensure separately distinguishable responses. 
The holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the 
pipe wall, care being taken to avoid distortion of the pipe while 
drilling. Depending upon the pipe diameter the calibration pipe 
shall contain the following hole: 
NPS ON Diameter of Drilled Hole 
s ½ s 15 0.039 in. [1 mm] 
> ½ s 1¼ > 15 s 32 0.055 in. [1.4 mm] 
> 1¼ s 2 > 32 s 50 0.071 in. [1.8 mm] 
> 2 s 5 > 50 s 125 0.087 in. [2.2 mm] 
>5 > 125 0.106 in. [2.7 mm] 
14.5.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool or 
file with a ¼-in. [6-mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe. The notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12 ½ % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. 
14.5.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
tube axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to have a depth not 
exceeding 12 ½ % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
14.5.4 Compatibility-The discontinuity in the calibration 
pipe shall be compatible with the testing equipment and the 
method being used. 
14.6 For flux leakage testing, the longitudinal calibration 
reference notches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a 
radial plane parallel to the pipe axis. For wall thicknesses under 
½ in. [12.7 mm], outside and inside notches shall be used; for 
wall thicknesses equal to and above½ in. [12.7 mm], only an 
outside notch shall be used. Notch depth shall not exceed 
12½ % of the specified wall thickness, or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], 
whichever is greater. Notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25 
mm], and the width shall not exceed the depth. Outside 
diameter and inside diameter notches shall be located suffi­
ciently apart to allow separation and identification of the 
signals. 
14.7 Pipe containing one or more imperfections that pro­
duce a signal equal to or greater than the signal produced by the 
calibration standard shall be rejected or the area producing the 
signal shall be reexamined. 
14.7.1 Test signals produced by imperfections which cannot 
be identified, or produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections 
shall result in rejection of the pipe, unless it is repaired and 
retested. To be accepted, the pipe must pass the same specifi­
cation test to which it was originally subjected, provided that 
the remaining wall thickness is not decreased below that 
pennitted by this specification. The OD at the point of grinding 
may be reduced by the amount so reduced. 
14.7.2 Test signals produced by visual imperfections such as 
those listed below may be evaluated in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 18: 
173 
14.7.2.1 Dinges, 
14.7.2.2 Straightener marks, 
14.7.2.3 Cutting chips, 
14.7.2.4 Scratches, 
14.7.2.5 Steel die stamps, 
14.7.2.6 Stop marks, or 
14.7.2.7 Pipe reducer ripple. 
14.8 The test methods described in this section are not 
necessarily capable of inspecting the end portion of pipes, a 
condition referred to as "end effect." The length of such end 
effect shall be determined by the manufacturer and, when 
specified in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
15. Nipples 
15.1 Nipples shall be cut from pipe of the same dimensions 
and quality described in this specification.

18. Workmanship, Finish and Appearance 
18.1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient num­
ber of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable 
assurance that they have been properly evaluated with respect 
to depth. Exploration of all surface imperfections is not 
required but consideration should be given to the necessity of 
exploring all surface imperfections to assure compliance with 
18.2. 
18.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 12½ % 
of the nominal wall thickness or encroach on the minimum 
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with such 
defects shall be given one of the following dispositions: 
18.2.1 The defect shall be removed by grinding, provided 
that the remaining wall thickness is within the limits specified 
in 16.3. 
18.2.2 Repaired in accordance with the repair welding 
provisions of 18.6. 
18.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect may be cut 
off within the limits of requirements on length. 
18.2.4 Rejected. 
18.3 To provide a workmanlike finish and basis for evalu­
ating conformance with 18.2 the pipe manufacturer shall 
remove by grinding the following noninjurious imperfections: 
18.3.1 Mechanical marks and abrasions-such as cable 
marks, dinges, guide marks, roll marks, ball scratches, scores, 
and die marks-and pits, any of which imperfections are 
deeper than 1/16 in. [l.6 mm]. 
174 
18.3.2 Visual imperfections commonly referred to as scabs, 
seams, laps, tears, or slivers found by exploration in accor­
dance with 18.1 to be deeper than 5 % of the nominal wall 
thickness. 
18.4 At the purchaser's discretion, pipe shall be subjected to 
rejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 18.2 are not 
scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is 
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall 
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
18.5 When imperfections or defects are removed by 
grinding, a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the 
wall thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by 
this specification. The outside diamet()r at the point of grinding 
is permitted to be reduced by the amount so removed. 
18.5.1 Wall thickness measurements shall be made with a 
mechanical caliper or with a properly calibrated nondestructive 
testing device of appropriate accuracy. In case of dispute, the 
measurement determined by use of the mechanical caliper shall 
govern. 
18.6 Weld repair shall be permitted only subject to the 
approval of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification 
A530/A530M. 
18.7 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight. 
19. End Finish 
19.1 The Pipe shall be furnished to the following practice,

specified by agreement between the purchaser and the manu­
facturer. 
20. Sampling 
20.1 For product analysis (see 9.1) and tensile tests (see 
21.1), a lot is the number of lengths of the same size and wall 
thickness from any one heat of steel; of 400 lengths or fraction 
thereof, of each size up to, but not including, NPS 6 [DN 150]; 
and of 200 lengths or fraction thereof of each size NPS 6 [DN 
150] and over. 
20.2 For bend tests (see 21.2), a lot is the number of lengths 
of the same size and wall thickness from any one heat of steel, 
of 400 lengths or fraction thereof, of each size.

laminations, cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this 
supplementary requirement is specified, the number of tests per 
pipe required shall also be specified. If a specimen from any 
length shows objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, 
subject to removal of the defective end and subsequent retests 
indicating the remainder of the length to be sound and 
reasonably uniform material. 
S6. Carbon Equivalent 
S6.1 The steel shall conform to a carbon equivalent (CE) of 
0.50 maximum as determined by the following formula:

SA-134/SA-134M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Pipe, Steel, Electric-Fusion (Arc)-Welded (Sizes NPS 16 and 
Over) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers electric-fusion (arc)-welded 
straight seam or spiral seam steel pipe NPS 16 and over in 
diameter (inside or outside as specified by purchaser), with 
wall thicknesses up to ¾ in. [19 mm], inclusive. Pipe having 
other dimensions may be furnished provided such pipe com­
plies with all other requirements of this specification. The pipe 
is available in various grades based on the ASTM specification 
ordered (Section 4). 
Note 1-Acceptability for many services may be controlled by codes 
or standards such as those published by the American National Standards 
Institute and American Society of Mechanical Engineers. 
Note 2-For testing methods not specifically covered in this 
specification, reference can be made to Test Methods and Definitions 
A370, with particular reference to Annex A2 on Steel Tubular Products. 
Note 3-A comprehensive listing of standardized pipe dimensions is 
contained in ANSI B 36.10. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. In this 
specification hard or rationalized conversions apply to 
diameter, lengths, and tensile properties. Soft conversion ap­
plies to other SI measurements. 
Note 4-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
1.3 The following caveat pertains specifically to Section 5 
of this specification. This standard does not purport to address 
all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is 
the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish 
180 
appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and 
determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to 
use. 
l.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for electric-fusion arc-welded pipe under this 
specification shall contain information concerning as many of 
the following items as are required, to describe the desired pipe 
adequately: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material (electric-fusion (arc)-welded pipe), 
3.1.3 ASTM Specification A134 or A134M and year date, 
3.1.4 Grade (if applicable) of steel from which the pipe shall 
be made (Section 4), 
3.1.5 Size (inside or outside diameter and nominal wall 
thickness), and 
3.1.6 Length (specified or random). 
3.2 The purchaser shall have the option to order additional 
requirements, including, but not limited to the following: 
3.2.1 Specific straightness requirements (see 12.3), 
3.2.2 End finish (Section 14), 
3.2.3 Hydrostatic Test Pressure (Section 11), 
3.2.4 Protective coating (Section 20), 
3.2.5 End use of pipe, and 
3.2.6 Other special or supplementary requirements, if any. 
4. Material 
4.1 The steel from which the pipe is made shall conform to 
Specifications A36/A36M, A283/A283M, A285/A285M, 
AlOll/AlOllM, A1018/A1018M, or to other ASTM specifi­
cations for equally suitable weldable material, as specified. For 
purposes of marking and certification, when required, the pipe 
grade of material shall be established by the A xxx plate 
specification designation and plate grade, when applicable. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 The longitudinal edges of the steel shall be shaped to 
give the most satisfactory results by the particular welding 
process employed. The steel shall then be properly formed and 
may be tacked preparatory to welding. The weld shall be made 
by automatic means (except tack welds) and shall be of 
reasonably uniform width and height for the entire length of the 
pipe. By agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer, manual welding by qualified procedure and 
welders may be used as an equal alternate under this specifi­
cation. 
5.2 All longitudinal seams, spiral seams, and shop girth 
seams shall be butt-welded. 
6. Number of Production Weld Tests 
6.1 One weld test specimen specified in Section 8 shall be 
made from each lot of 3000 ft [900 m] of pipe or fraction 
thereof of each size and wall thickness. 
6.2 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws not associated with the welding, it may be 
discarded and another specimen substituted. 
6.3 Each length of pipe shall be subjected to the hydrostatic 
test specified in Section 11, unless otherwise specified in 11.3. 
7. Retests 
7.1 If any specimen tested in accordance with Section 10 
fails to meet the requirements, retests of two additional 
specimens from the same lot of pipe shall be made, each of 
which shall meet the requirements specified. If any of the 
retests fail to conform to the requirements, test specimens may 
be taken from each untested pipe length at the manufacturer's 
option. Each specimen shall meet the requirements specified, 
or that pipe shall be rejected. 
8. Test Specimens of Production Welds 
8.1 The weld-test specimens for the reduced-section tension 
test shall be taken perpendicularly across the weld and from the 
end of the pipe or, alternatively, from flat test pieces of material 
conforming to the requirements in the specifications used in the 
manufacture of the pipe. The alternative weld-test specimens 
shall be welded with the same procedure and by the same 
operator and equipment, and in sequence with the welding of 
the longitudinal joints in the pipe. The test pieces shall have the 
weld approximately in the middle of the specimen. The 
specimens shall be straightened cold, and shall be tested at 
room temperature. 
8.2 Reduced-section tension-test specimens shall be pre­
pared in accordance with Fig. A2.3 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370, Annex A2 Steel Tubular Products. 
9. Qualification of Welding Procedure 
9.1 The welding procedure shall be qualified in accordance 
with the American Welding Society Standard Qualification 
Procedure 5 or ASME Section IX of the Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code as agreed to between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser using the tests and test values specified in 9.2 and 
9.3. Thicknesses less than 3/s in. [10 mm] shall be qualified for 
each wall thickness of pipe manufactured. Thicknesses 3/s to ¾ • 
in. [10 mm to 19 mm], inclusive, shall be qualified in 3/s-in. 
[10-mm] thickness. 
181 
9.2 Two reduced-section tension specimens (transverse 
weld) made in accordance with Fig. A2.3 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370, with the weld reinforcement removed, shall 
show a tensile strength not less than 100 % of the minimum 
specified tensile strength of the base material used. 
9.3 Two face-bend test specimens shall be prepared in 
accordance with Section A2.5.l.7 of Test Methods and Defi­
nitions A370 and shall withstand being bent 180° in a jig 
substantially in accordance with Fig. A2.15.3 of Test Methods 
and Definitions A370. The bend test shall be acceptable if no 
cracks·or other defects exceeding 1/s in. [3 mm] in any direction 
be present in the weld metal or between the weld and the pipe

=== Page 234 ===

SA-134/SA-134M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
metal after bending. Cracks that originate along the edges of 
the specimens during testing and that are less than ¼ in. [6 
mm] in any direction, shall not be considered. 
10. Tensile Properties of Production Welds 
10.1 Reduced-section tension test specimens required in 
Section 8, taken perpendicularly across the weld with the weld 
reinforcement removed, shall show a tensile strength not less 
than 95 % of the specified minimum strength of the steel. At 
the manufacturer's option, the test may be made without 
removing the weld reinforcement, in which case the tensile 
strength shall be not less than the specified minimum tensile 
strength for the grade of steel used. 
11. Hydrostatic.Test (Note 5) 
11.1 Each length of pipe shall be tested by the manufacturer 
to a hydrostatic pressure that will produce in the pipe wall a 
stress of 60 % of the specified minimum yield point of the steel 
used at room temperature. The pressure shall be determined by 
the following equation: 
P = 2St/D 
where: 
P = minimum hydrostatic test pressure, psi (Note 6) (not to 
exceed 2800 psi [19 MPa]), 
S = 0.60 times the minimum specified yield point of the 
steel used, psi [MPa], 
t = specified wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
D = specified outside diameter, in. [mm]. 
NoTE 5-A hydrostatic sizing operation is not to be considered a 
hydrostatic test or a substitute for it. 
NoTE 6-When the diameter and wall thickness of pipe are such that the 
capacity limits of testing equipment are exceeded by these requirements, 
the test pressures may be reduced by agreement between the purchaser and 
the manufacturer. 
11.2 Test pressure shall be held for not less than 5 s, or for 
a longer time as agreed upon between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
NoTE 7-When agreed upon between the purchaser and the manufac­
turer and so stated on the order, pipe may be tested to one and one half 
times the specified working pressure, except that the maximum test 
pressure shall not exceed 2800 psi [19 MPa] nor shall the maximum fiber 
stress exceed 85 % of specified minimum yield point of steel or to a fiber 
stress that does not exceed 85 % of the specified minimum yield point of 
the steel or 2800-psi [19-MPa] test pressure. 
11.3 When specified in the order, pipe may be furnished 
without hydrostatic testing and each length so furnished shall 
include the mandatory marking of the letters "NH." 
Additionally, the certification, when required, shall state "Not 
Hydrostatically Tested" and the specification number and 
material grade, as shown on the certification, shall be followed 
by the letters "NH." 
12. Permissible Variations in Weights and Dimensions 
12.1 Thickness and Weight-The wall thickness and weight 
for welded pipe under this specification shall be governed by 
the requirements of the specifications to which the steel was 
ordered. 
182 
12.2 Circumference-The outside circumference of the pipe 
shall not vary more than ±0.5 % from the nominal outside 
circumference based upon the diameter specified, except that 
the circumference at ends shall be sized, if necessary, to meet 
the requirements of Section 14. 
12.3 Straightness-Finished pipe shall be commercially 
straight. When specific straightness requirements are desired, 
the order should so state, and the tolerances shall be a matter of 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
12.4 Ovality-Out-of-roundness-The difference between 
major and minor outside diameter shall not exceed 1 %. Closer 
tolerances may be established by agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. Where the D/I' ( outside 
diameter/wall thickness) is over 120, internal bracing should be 
utilized to achieve sizing of ends and ovality shall be by 
agreement between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
13. Lengths 
13.1 Pipe lengths shall be supplied in accordance with the 
following regular practice: 
13.1.1 The lengths shall be as specified on the order with a 
tolerance of±½ in. [13 mm], except that the shorter lengths 
from which test coupons have been cut may also be shipped. 
13.1.2 When random lengths are specified, pipe shall be 
furnished in lengths having a minimum average of 29 ft [9 m] 
with a minimum length of 20 ft [6 m], but not more than 5 % 
may be under 25 ft [8 m]. 
13.2 Pipe lengths containing circumferentially welded joints 
(Note 8) shall be permitted by agreement between the manu­
facturer and the purchaser. Tests of these welded joints shall be 
made in accordance with the procedure tests specified in 
Section 9 and the production weld tests specified in Section 10. 
The number of production weld tests shall be one per each lot 
of 100 joints or fraction thereof, but not less than one for each 
welder or welding operator. 
NoTE 8-Joints are defined for the purpose of this specification as a 
circumferential welded seam lying in one plane, used to join lengths of 
straight pipe. 
14. Ends 
14.1 Pipe shall be furnished with a plain right-angle cut or 
with bevel ends as specified. All burrs at the ends of pipe shall 
be removed. 
14.1.1 Unless otherwise specified, pipe with beveled ends 
shall meet the requirements of ANSI B 16.25. 
14.2 Unless otherwise specified, the outside circumference 
of pipe ends for a distance of not less than 4 in. [100 mm] shall 
not vary more than ± 60 % of the nominal wall thickness of the 
pipe from the nominal outside circumference based on the 
diameter specified, except that the tolerance shall not be less 
than ± 3/16 in. [5 mm]. 
14.3 By agreement between the manufacturer and the pur­
chaser the ends of the pipe may be sized within agreed-upon 
tolerances if necessary to meet the requirements of special 
installations.

15. Finish 
15.1 Repair by Welding-The welding of injurious defects 
in the pipe wall, provided their depth does not exceed one third 
the specified wall thickness, will be permitted. Defects in the 
welds, such as sweats or leaks, shall be repaired or the piece 
rejected at the option of the manufacturer. Repairs of this 
nature shall be made by completely removing the defect, 
cleaning the cavity, and then welding. 
15.2 All repaired pipe shall be tested hydrostatically in 
accordance with Section 11, unless otherwise specified in 11.3. 
16. Inspection 
16.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry at all times while work on the contract of the purchaser 
is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's works 
that concern the manufacture of the material ordered. The 
manufacturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities 
to satisfy him that the material is being furnished in accordance 
with this specification. All tests and inspection shall be made at 
the place of manufacture prior to shipment and unless other­
wise specified, shall be so conducted as not to interfere 
unnecessarily with the operation of the works. If agreed upon, 
the manufacturer shall notify the purchaser in time so that he 
may have his inspector present to witness any part of the 
manufacture or tests that may be desired. The certification shall 
include reference to this specification and the pipe grade 
(ASTM plate specification designation and plate grade, when 
applicable). 
16.2 Certification-Upon request of the purchaser in the 
contract or order, a manufacturer's certification that the mate­
rial was manufactured and tested in accordance with this 
specification together with a report of the chemical and tensile 
tests shall be furnished. When hydrostatic test is omitted, the 
certificate shall include the letters "NH." 
17. Rejection 
17.1 Each length of pipe received from the manufacturer 
may be inspected by the purchaser and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of this specification based on the inspection and 
test method as outlined in the specification, the length may be 
rejected, and the manufacturer shall be notified. Disposition of 
rejected pipe shall be a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
17 .2 Pipe found in fabrication or in installation to be 
unsuitable for the intended use, under the scope and require­
ments of this specification, may be set aside and the manufac­
turer notified. Such pipe shall be subject to mutual investiga­
tion as to the nature and severity of the deficiency and the 
forming or installation, or both, conditions involved. Disposi­
tion shall be a matter of agreement between the purchaser and 
the manufacturer. 
18. Certification 
18.1 Upon request of the purchaser in the contract or order, 
a manufacturer's certification that the material was manufac­
tured and tested in accordance with this specification, including 
year date, together with a report of the chemical and tensile 
tests shall be furnished. The pipe grade shall be identified by 
the plate specification designation (year date not required) and 
the plate grade (where applicable). 
19. Product Marking 
19.1 Each section of pipe shall be marked with the manu­
facturer's distinguishing marking, this specification number, 
and the pipe grade. The marking need not include the year date 
of the pipe or plate specification. 
19.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 19.1, 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. 
20. Protective Coating 
20.1 If agreed upon between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer, the pipe shall be given a protective coating of the 
kind and in the manner specified by the purchaser. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall be applied only when specified by 
the purchaser in the inquiry, contract, or order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be 
agreed upon in writing by the manufacturer and purchaser. Supplementary requirements shall in no 
way negate any requirement of the specification itself.
