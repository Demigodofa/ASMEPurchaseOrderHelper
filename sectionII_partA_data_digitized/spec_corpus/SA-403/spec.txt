SA-403 /SA-403M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Wrought Austenitic Stainless Steel Piping Fittings 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers wrought stainless steel fittings 
for pressure piping applications. 
1.2 Several grades of austenitic stainless steel alloys are 
included in this specification Grades are designated with a 
prefix, WP or CR, based on the applicable ASME or MSS 
dimensional and rating standards, respectively. 
1.3 For each of the WP stainless grades, several classes of 
fittings are covered, to indicate whether seamless or welded 
construction was utilized. Class designations are also utilized 
to indicate the nondestructive test method and extent of 
nondestructive examination (NDE). Table 1 is a general 
summary of the fitting classes applicable to all WP grades of 
stainless steel covered by this specification. There are no 
classes for the CR grades. Specific requirements are covered 
elsewhere. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-confonnance with the 
standard. 
1.6 This specification does not apply to cast steel fittings. 
Austenitic stainless steel castings are covered in Specifications 
A351/A351M, A743/A743M, and A744/A744M. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-
674 
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Common Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A960/ A960M including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase 
order. Failure to comply with the common requirements of 
Specification A960/A960M constitutes nonconformance with 
this specification. In case of conflict between this specification 
and Specification A960/ A960M, this specification shall pre­
vail. 
3.2 Specification A960/A960M identifies the ordering infor­
mation that should be complied with when purchasing material 
to this specification. 
4. Material 
4.1 The material for fittings shall consist of forgings, bars, 
plates, or seamless or welded tubular products that conform to 
the chemical requirements in Table 2. See Table 3 for a list of 
common names. 
4.2 The steel shall be melted by one of the following 
processes: 
4.2.1 Electric furnace (with separate degassing and refining 
optional), 
4.2.2 Vacuum furnace, or 
4.2.3 One of the former followed by vacuum or electroslag­
consumable remelting. 
4.3 If secondary melting is employed, the heat shall be 
defined as all ingots remelted from a primary heat.

manufacturing of fittings to this specification. Methods and 
practices relating to chemical analyses required by this speci­
fication shall be in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, 
and Terminology A751. Product analysis tolerances in accor­
dance with Specification A960/A960M are applicable. 
7 .2 The steel shall not contain any unspecified elements for 
the ordered grade to the extent that it conforms to the 
requirements of another grade for which that element is a 
specified element having a required minimum content. 
7.3 In fittings of welded construction, the alloy content 
(carbon, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, niobium 
(columbium), and tantalum) of the deposited weld metal shall 
conform to that required of the base metal or for equivalent 
weld metal as given in the AWS filler metal specification A 5.4 
or A 5.9 (Type 348 weld metal is listed in AWS A 5.9 but not 
in AWS A 5.4). Exceptions are when welding on Types 304L 
and 304 base metals, the deposited weld metal shall 
correspond, respectively, to AWS E308L (ER308L) and E308 
(ER308). When welding 3 lOS or 310H, the weld metal shall 
correspond to A WS ER310 unless otherwise advised by the 
purchaser at the time of placement on the purchase order. When 
welding on Type 321 base metal, the weld metal shall 
correspond to AWS Type E347 (ER347 or ER321); and, when 
welding on S31725, S31726, S31254, S31266, or S33228 
deposited weld metal shall correspond either to the alloy 
content of the base metal or to AWS AS .11 E NiCrMo-3 (UNS 
W86112) (AWS AS.14 Ni Cr Mo-3 (UNS N06625)), and when 
welding on S3 l 730, deposited weld metal and filler metal used 
shall cmTespond either to the alloy content of the base metal or 
to AWS AS.14 ERNiCr-3 (UNS N06082), or ERNiCrMo-3 
(UNS N06625), or ERNiCrMo-4 (UNS N10276). On S38815 
base metals, the deposited weld metal and filler metal used 
shall be agreed upon between purchaser and manufacturer. In 
fittings of welded construction made from predominantly 
fe1rnus alloys N08020, N08367, N08700, N08800, N08810, 
N08811, N08904, N08925 & N08926, the alloy content of the 
deposited weld metal shall conform to that required of the base 
metal or for the equivalent weld metal given in the AWS Filler 
Metal Specification AS.11 and AS.14. However, it is possible 
that weld deposit chemistry will not meet the limits of either 
the base metal or the filler metal for some elements. The weld 
deposit chemistry shall meet the lowest minimum and highest 
maximum values for each specification element in either of the 
base metal or filler metal specification. Dilution of the base and 
filler metal must be considered when determining weld deposit 
criteria for over-alloyed filler metals. 
7.3.1 Supplementary Requirement SI may be specified 
where 16-8-2 filler metal is required for joining thick sections 
of Types 316, 321, or 347 and has adequate corrosion resis­
tance for the intended service.

SA-409/SA-409M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Welded Large Diameter Austenitic Steel Pipe for Corrosive 
or High-Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers straight seam or spiral seam 
electric-fusion-welded, light-wall, austenitic chromium-nickel 
alloy steel pipe for corrosive or high-temperature service. The 
sizes covered are NPS 14 to 30 with extra light (Schedule 5S) 
and light (Schedule lOS) wall thicknesses. Table Xl.1 shows 
the wall thickness of Schedule 5S and lOS pipe. Pipe having 
other dimensions may be furnished provided such pipe com­
plies with all other requirements of this specification. 
1.2 Several grades of alloy steel are covered as indicated in 
Table 1. 
1.3 Optional supplementary requirements are provided. 
These call for additional tests to be made, and when desired 
shall be stated in the order, together with the number of such 
tests required. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
Norn 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as nominal 
diameter, size, and nominal size. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

12.1 The finished pipe shall have a workmanlike finish. 
12.2 Repair of Defects by Machining or Grinding-Pipe 
showing moderate slivers or other surface defects may be 
machined or ground inside or outside to a depth which will 
ensure the removal of all defects providing the wall thickness 
is not reduced below the minimum specified in 9 .1. 
12.3 Repair of Defects by Welding-Defects which violate 
minimum wall thickness may be repaired by welding, but only 
with the approval of the purchaser. Areas shall be suitably 
prepared for welding with tightly closed defects removed by 
grinding. Open, clean defects, such as pits or impressions, may 
require no preparation. All welders, welding operators, and 
weld procedures shall be qualified to the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX. Unless the purchaser speci­
fies otherwise, pipe required to be heat treated under the 
provisions of 5.3 shall be heat treated or reheat treated 
following repair welding. Repaired lengths, where repair depth 
is greater tl1an ¼ of the thickness, shall be pressure tested or 
repressure tested after repair and heat treatment (if any). Repair 
welds shall also be examined by suitable non-destructive 
examination techniques, including any techniques specifically 
required of the primary weld. 
12.4 The pipe shall be free of scale and contaminating iron 
particles. Pickling, blasting, or surface finishing is not manda­
tory when pipe is bright annealed. The purchaser may request 
that a passivating treatment be applied. 
13. Test Specimens 
13.1 Transverse tension and bend test specimens may be 
taken from a test plate of the same material as the pipe, made 
by attaching a formed cylinder to the end of the pipe and 
welding the abutting edges as a continuation and duplication of 
the seam of the pipe (run-off plate). As an alternative to a 
formed cylinder, the run-off plate may consist of flat plates 
with reinforcing bars clamped to the underside to prevent 
distortion. The run-off plate material shall be of the same heat, 
preferably shear croppings from the same plate. 
13.2 When heat treatment is required, test specimens shall 
be cut from pipe after the heat treating has been completed, or 
specimens removed from the pipe prior to heat treating shall be 
heat treated with the pipe. 
14. Transverse Guided-Bend Weld Tests 
14.1 Two bend test specimens shall be taken transversely 
across the weld. One shall be subject to a face guided-bend test 
and the second to a root guided-bend test. One specimen shall 
be bent with the inside surface of the pipe against the plunger, 
and the other with the outside surface against the plunger. 
14.2 The bend test shall be acceptable if no cracks or other 
defects exceeding 1/s in. [3 mm] in any direction are present in 
the weld metal or between the weld and the pipe metal after 
bending. Cracks which originate along the edges of the 
specimen dming testing, and that are less than ¼ in. [6.5 llllll] 
measured in any direction shall not be considered. 
15. Pressure Tests 
15 .1 Where hydrostatic test equipment is not available, the 
pipe may be air or gas pressure tested with an internal pressure 
of 100 psi [700 kPa]. The weld and weld area shall be inspected 
with the use of soap solution or any other prepared solution 
which will detect the leakage of air or gas from the inside. 
15.2 Instead of a pressure test, when mutually agreed upon 
between the purchaser and manufacturer, the entire weld area 
of each pipe, including circumferential welds, may be tested by 
nondestructive testing methods. These methods shall be ca­
pable of detecting both surface and subsurface defects. 
16. Inspection 
16.1 When specified in the purchase order, the pipe may be 
inspected at the manufacturer's plant by an inspector repre­
senting the purchaser. The inspector shall have entry at all 
times. The manufacturer shall afford the inspector, all reason­
able facilities to satisfy him that the material is being furnished 
in accordance with these specifications. 
690 
17. Certification 
17 .1 Certification in accordance with the provisions of 
Specification A999/ A999M shall be furnished. When specified 
on the purchase order or when a specific type of melting 
has been specified on the purchase order, the type of 
melting used shall also be reported to the purchaser or the 
purchaser's representative. 
18. Product Marking 
18.1 Each length of pipe manufactured in accordance with 
this specification shall have the following identifying marking 
witl1in 12 in. [300 llllll] of one end: manufacturer's name or 
trade-mark, specification number, grade number of the alloy, 
the manufacturer's heat number, size, and schedule number. 
Additional marking requirements for heat treatment are de­
scribed in Supplementary Requirement S2. 
18.2 Marking shall be legibly stenciled with a suitable paint 
or permanent marking compound, except when otherwise 
specified by the purchaser.

Specification for 
Piping Fittings of Wrought Carbon Steel and Alloy Steel for 
Low-Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers wrought carbon steel and 
alloy steel fittings of seamless and welded construction, cov­
ered by the latest revision of ASME B16.9, ASME B16.11, 
MSS SP-79, MSS SP-83, MSS SP-95, and MSS SP-97. 
Fittings differing from these ASME and MSS standards shall 
be furnished in accordance with Supplementary Requirement 
S58 of Specification A960/A960M. These fittings are for use in 
pressure piping and pressure vessel service at low tempera­
tures. 
1.2 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for 
fittings where a greater degree of examination is desired. When 
desired, one or more of these supplementary requirements shall 
be specified in the order. 
1.3 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

specified in the order. 
8. Chemical Composition 
8 .1 The steel shall conform to requirements of chemical 
composition for the respective material prescribed in Table 1. 
8.2 The steel shall not contain any unspecified elements for 
the ordered grade to the extent that it then conforms to the 
requirements of another grade for which that element is a 
specified element having a required minimum content. 
8.3 The chemical composition of weld metal is not required 
to meet the same limits of the base materials however, the 
composition of the weld deposit shall be such that it meets the 
minimum mechanical and impact requirements of this specifi­
cation. In general, the alloy content shall be similar to that of 
the base metal but shall not exceed 6 % except in the case of 
fittings of 9 % nickel steel. 
8.4 A product analysis is optional. 
9. Tensile Properties 
9 .1 The tensile properties of the fittings material shall 
conform to the requirements for the applicable grade of 
material as listed in Table 3. 
9 .1.1 Longitudinal or transverse specimens cut from either 
a fitting or from starting plate or pipe they were manufactured 
from shall be acceptable for the tension test. For fittings made 
from forgings, the test specimen shall meet the requirements of 
Specification A350/ A350M for the tension test. 
9.1.2 While Table 3 specifies elongation requirements for 
both longitudinal and transverse specimens, it is not the intent 
that both requirements apply simultaneously. Instead, it is 
intended that only the elongation requirement that is appropri­
ate for the specimen used be applicable. Unless specified by the 
customer, tensile test orientation is at the discretion of the 
manufacturer. 
9.2 At least one tension test shall be made on each heat of 
material and in the same condition of heat treatment as the 
finished fittings it represents provided that the wall thickness of 
the fitting and the representative sample thickness do not vary 
more than ¼ in. [6 mm]. At least one tension test per heat of 
weld metal shall be made after heat treatment in the same 
manner as the base metal. Results of the tension test of the 
weld metal need not be reported unless Supplementary Re­
quirement S51 of Specification A960/A960M is specified.

material of the fitting meets the tensile requirements of this 
specification. 
10. Impact Test Properties 
10. I Properties: 
10.1.1 The notched bar impact properties of the base metal 
and weld metal shall conform to the requirements of Table 4 or 
Table 5 for the applicable grade of material. 
10.1.2 Retest-When the average value of the three speci­
mens equals or exceeds the minimum value permitted for a 
single specimen and the value for more than one specimen is 
below the required average value, or when the value for one 
specimen is below the minimum value permitted for a single 
specimen, a retest of three additional specimens shall be made. 
The value for each of these retest specimens shall equal or 
exceed the required average value. When an erratic result is 
caused by a defective specimen, or there is uncertainty in test 
procedure, a retest shall be allowed. 
10.2 Procedures: 
10.2.1 All material furnished under this specification shall 
be tested for impact resistance at the temperature for the 
respective grade in Table 6. Exceptions to these requirements 
are permissible when agreed upon between the purchaser and 
producer and specified in the order, in that the impact test is 
acceptable when made at temperatures different from those 
shown in Table 6, provided the test temperature is at least as 
low as the intended service temperature, and fittings are 
suitably marked in accordance with Section 19 to identify the 
reported test temperature. 
10.2.2 The notched-bar impact test shall be made in accor­
dance with the procedure for the simple-beam, Charpy-type 
test of Test Methods and Definitions A370 if the inch-pound 
units are specified or Test Methods Al058 if the M suffix (SI 
units) standard is specified. Each impact test shall consist of 
breaking three specimens. 
10.3 Specimens: 
10.3.1 Notched-bar impact specimens shall be simple-beam, 
Charpy-type A with a V-notch in accordance with Test Methods 
and Definitions A370 if the inch-pound units are specified or 
Test Methods Al058 if the M suffix (SI Units) standard is 
specified. Standard specimens 10 by 10 mm in cross section 
shall be used unless the material to be tested is of insufficient 
thickness, in which case the largest obtainable standard subsize 
impact specimens shall be used. When the size or shape of the 
finished fittings is insufficient to permit obtaining the smallest 
standard subsize impact specimens, an impact test by the fitting 
manufacturer will not be required. The material from which the 
specimens are taken shall be heat treated with a furnace charge 
in accordance with 10.4.2 or 10.4.3. Impact tests shall be made 
from either the raw material from which the fittings are made 
or from a finished fitting at the option of the manufacturer. 
10.3.2 Test specimens shall be obtained so that the longitu­
dinal axis of the specimen is parallel to the longitudinal axis of 
the fitting while the axis of the "V" shall be perpendicular to 
the surface. On wall thickness over 1 in. [25 mm] the 
specimens shall be obtained with their longitudinal axis located 
½ in. [13 mm] from the outer surface.

ment are available, then one impact test from each heat is 
required, provided that all other heat treatments are conducted 
at the same temperatures and within the same 50 °F [28 °C] 
range as the furnace charge that contained the test specimens. 
10.4.4 On fittings of welded construction, additional impact 
tests of the same number as required in 10.4.1 or 10.4.2 shall 
be made to test the weld metal. 
10.4.5 Specimens showing defects while being machined or 
prior to testing shall be discarded, and replacements shall be 
considered as original specimens. 
10.5 Retreatment: 
10.5.1 If the results of impact tests conducted in accordance 
with 10.4.2 and 10.4.3 fail to conform to the test requirements 
specified in 10.1, that group of fittings shall be retreated and 
submitted for test. No group of fittings shall be retreated more 
than twice. 
11. Hydrostatic Tests 
11.1 Hydrostatic testing of fittings is not required by this 
specification. 
11.2 All fittings shall be capable of withstanding without

15.1 All fusion-welded butt joints shall be radiographically 
examined throughout the entire length in accordance with 
Paragraph UW-51 of Section VIII, Division 1, of the ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Instead of radiographic 
examination, welds made by the manufacturer may be ultra­
sonically examined in accordance with Appendix 12 of Section 
VIII, Division 1, of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code. In general, radiography or ultrasonic examination shall 
be performed after all forming operations have been com­
pleted. Fittings made from fusion-welded pipe need not be 
radiographed if the pipe has been radiographed, provided the 
fitting forming process does not materially affect the weld. 
16. Inspection 
16.l All tests and inspections shall be made at the place of 
manufacture, unless otherwise agreed to. 
16.2 Other tests, when required by agreement shall be made 
from materials of the lots covered in the order.

17. Rejection and Rehearing 
17 .1 Material that fails to conform to the requirements of 
this specification shall be rejected. Rejection should be re­
ported to the producer or supplier promptly and in writing. In 
case of dissatisfaction with the results of the test, the producer 
or supplier shall make claim for a rehearing. 
17 .2 Fittings that develop defects in shop working or 
application operations shall be rejected. Upon rejection, the 
manufacturer shall be notified promptly in writing. 
18. Certification 
18.1 Test reports are required for all fittings covered by this 
specification. Each test report shall meet the requirements for 
certification in Specification A960/ A960M as well as include 
the following information specific to this specification: 
18.1.1 Chemical analysis results, Section 8 (Table 1), re­
ported results shall be to the same number of significant figures 
as the limits specified in Table 1 for that element, 
18.1.2 Tensile property results, Section 9 (Table 3) report 
yield strength and tensile strength in ksi [MPa] and elongation 
in percent, and tensile test orientation, 
18.1.3 Impact test results, Section 10 (Table 4 and Table 5), 
18.1.4 Type heat treatment, Section 7, 
18.1.5 Statement regarding radiographic or ultrasonic ex­
amination of welds, Section 15, and 
18.1.6 Any supplementary testing required by the purchase 
order. 
19. Product Marking 
19 .1 In addition to marking requirements of Specification 
A960/ A960M, the following additional marking requirements 
shall apply: 
19.1.1 Fittings shall be marked by any method which will 
identify the fittings and not result in sharp discontinuities. 
Stamping, when used, shall be done with blunt-nosed continu­
ous or blunt-nosed interrupted dot stamps. 
19.1.2 When agreed upon between the purchaser and 
producer, and specified in the order, the markings shall be 
painted or stenciled on the fitting or stamped on a metal or 
plastic tag which shall be securely attached to the fitting. 
19.1.3 Fittings containing welds that have been ultrasoni­
cally examined instead of radiography shall be marked U after 
heat identity. 
19.1.4 Threaded or socket welding fittings shall be marked 
with the pressure class. Plugs and bushings furnished to ASME 
B 16.11 requirements are not required to be marked. 
19.1.5 The impact test temperature shall also be shown if it 
is different from the standard test temperature specified in 
Table 6, for example: WPL-6-60 or WPL3-176. 
19.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 19.1, 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. The bar coding system, if applied at 
the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one of 
the published industry standards for bar coding. If used on 
small fittings, the bar code may be applied to the box or a 
substantially applied tag.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the supplementary requirements appearing in Specification A960/A960M may be 
included in the order or contract. When so included, a supplementary requirement shall have the same 
force as if it were in the body of the specification. Supplementary requirement details not fully 
described shall be agreed upon between the purchaser and the supplier. 
Sl. ASME Section III Construction 
S 1.1 Products welded with filler metal furnished under this 
specification that are intended for application under the rules of 
Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code shall 
be manufactured by holders of the appropriate ASME Certifi­
cate of Authorization and Certification Mark. The product is 
subject to all applicable requirements of Section III, including 
welding, heat treatment, nondestructive examination, autho­
rized inspection at the point of manufacture, and application of 
the Certification Mark. 
S 1.2 The applicable ASME Partial Data Report form, 
signed by an Authorized Nuclear Inspector, and a material test 
report shall be furnished for each lot of pipe. 
705 
S 1.3 The material used to fabricate the pipe fitting shall 
conform to the applicable SA specification in ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code, Section II. The welded joints shall be 
full penetration butt welds as obtained by double welding or by 
other means that will obtain the same quality of deposited weld 
metal on the inside and outside. Welds using metal backing 
strips that remain in place are prohibited. 
S 1.4 Each piece of pipe fitting shall be so marked as to 
identify each such piece of pipe fitting with the lot and the 
material test report.
