SA-747 /SA-747M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR STEEL CASTINGS, STAINLESS, 
PRECIPITATION HARDENING 
SA-747/SA-747M 
Odentical with ASTM Specification A 747 / A 747M-04 except for the revision of the mandatory ordering requirements of para. 4.1.6 and the 
mandatory use of Supplementary Requirement SIS of SA-781/SA-781M.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers iron-chromium-nickel­
copper corrosion-resistant steel castings, capable of being 
strengthened by precipitation hardening heat treatment. 
1.2 These castings may be used in services requiring 
corrosion resistance and high strengths at temperatures up 
to 600°F [315°C]. They may be machined in the solution­
annealed condition and subsequently precipitation hard­
ened to the desired high-strength mechanical properties 
specified in Table Sl4.l with little danger of cracking or 
distortion. 
1.3 The material is not intended for use in the solution­
annealed condition. 
NOTE 1 - If the service environment in which the material is to be 
used is considered conducive to stress-corrosion cracking, precipitation 
hardening should be performed at a temperature that will minimize the 
susceptibility of the material to this type of attack. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification.

INTERNATIONAL 
Standards Worldwide 
[Identical with AS1M Specification A 749/A 749M-97(2002).] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers the general requirements 
for hot-rolled steel strip in coils and cut lengths. It applies 
to carbon steel and high-strength, low-alloy steel furnished 
as hot-rolled. 
1.2 This specification is not applicable to hot-rolled 
heavy-thickness carbon sheet and strip coils (ASTM Speci­
fication A 635 / A 635M), cold-rolled carbon steel strip 
(ASTM Specification A 109 or A 109M), high-strength, 
low-alloy coldrolled steel (ASTM Specifications A 606 and 
A 607) or cold-rolled carbon spring steel (ASTM Specifi­
cation A 682 or A 682M). 
1.3 In case of any conflict in requirements, the require­
ments of the individual material specification shall prevail 
over those of this general specification. 
1.4 For the purposes of determining conformance with 
this and the appropriate product specification referenced 
under 2.1, values shall be rounded to the nearest unit in 
the right hand place of figures used in expressing the lim­
iting values in accordance with the rounding method of 
Practice E 29. 
1.5 Annex Al lists permissible variations in dimensions 
and mass (Note 1) in S.I. [metric] units. The values listed 
are not exact conversions of the values listed in the inch­
pound tables, but instead are rounded or rationalized val­
ues. Conformance to Annex Al is mandatory when the 
"M" specification is used. 
NOTE 1 - The tenn "weight" is used when inch-pound units are the 
standard; however, under S.I., the preferred tennis "mass." 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
must be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in nonconformance with 
the specification. 
1.7 This specification and the applicable material speci­
fications are expressed in both inch-pound units and SI 
units. However, unless the order specifies the applicable 
"M" specification designation (SI units), the material shall 
be furnished to inch-pound units.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
Descriptions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 Steel Types: 
3.1.2 carbon steel - the designation for steel when 
no minimum content is specified or required for aluminum, 
chromium, cobalt, columbium, molybdenum, nickel, tita­
nium, tungsten, vanadium, zirconium, or any element 
added to obtain a desired alloying effect; when the specified 
minimum for copper does not exceed 0.40%; or when 
the maximum content specified for any of the following 
elements does not exceed the percentages noted; manga­
nese 1.65, silicon 0.60, or copper 0.60. 
Discussion - In all carbon steels small quantities of 
certain residual elements unavoidably retained from raw 
materials are sometimes found which are not specified or 
required, such as copper, nickel, molybdenum, chromium, 
etc. These elements are considered as incidental and are 
not normally determined or reported. 
3.1.3 high-strength, low-alloy steel - a specific 
group of steels in which higher strength, and in some cases 
additional resistance to atmospheric corrosion, are obtained 
by moderate amounts of one or more al\oying elements. 
3.1.4 Product Types: 
3.1.5 hot-rolled strip - manufactured by hot rolling 
billets or slabs to the required thickness. It may be produced 
single width or by rolling multiple width and slitting to 
the desired width. It can be supplied in coils or cut lengths 
as specified.

5. C11emical Composition 
5.1 Limits: 
5.1.1 The chemical composition shall be in accor­
dance with the applicable product specification. However, 
if other compositions are required for carbon steel, they 
shall be prepared in accordance with Appendix Xl. 
5.1.2 Where the material is used for fabrication by 
welding, care must be exercised in the selection of chemical 
composition or mechanical properties to ensure compatibil­
ity with the welding process and its effect on altering the 
properties. 
5.2 Cast or Heat (Formerly Ladle) Analysis: 
5.2.1 An analysis of each cast or heat of steel shall 
be made by the manufacturer to determine the percentage 
of elements specified or restricted by the applicable speci­
fication. 
5.2.2 When requested, cast or heat analysis for ele­
ments listed or required shall be reported to the purchaser 
or to his representative. 
5.3 Product, Check, or Verification Analysis: 
5.3.1 Nonkilled steels (such as capped or rimmed) 
are not technologically suited to product analysis due to 
the nonuniform character of their chemical composition 
and therefore, the tolerances in Table 1 do not apply. Prod­
uct analysis is appropriate on these types of steel only 
when misapplication is apparent or for copper when copper 
steel is specified. 
5.3.2 For steels other than nonkilled (capped or 
rimmed), product analysis may be made by the purchaser. 
The chemical analysis shall not vary from the limits speci­
fied by more than the amounts in Table 1. The several 
1223

=== Page 1296 ===

SA-749/SA-749M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
determinations of any element in a cast shall not vary both 
above and below the specified range. 
5.4 Sampling for Product Analysis: 
5.4.1 To indicate adequately the representative com­
position of a cast by product analysis, it is general practice 
to select samples to represent the steel, as fairly as possible, 
from a minimum number of pieces as follows: 3 pieces 
for lots up to 15 tons inclusive, and 6 pieces for lots over 
15 tons [15 Mg]. 
5.4.2 When the steel is subject to tension test require­
ments, samples for product analysis may be taken either 
by drilling entirely through the used tension test specimens 
themselves or in accordance with 5.4.3. 
5.4.3 When the steel is not subject to tension test 
requirements, the samples for analysis must be taken by 
milling or drilling entirely through the stlip in a sufficient 
number of places so that the samples are representative of 
the entire stlip. The sampling may be facilitated by folding 
the stlip both ways, so that several samples may be taken 
at one drilling. Steel subjected to certain heating operations 
by the purchaser may not give chemical analysis results 
that properly represent its original composition. Therefore, 
users must analyze chips taken from the steel in the condi­
tion in which it is received from the steel manufacturer. 
5.5 Specimen Preparation - Drillings or chips must be 
taken without the application of water, oil, or other lubri­
cant, and must be free of scale, grease, dirt, or other foreign 
substances. They must not be overheated during cutting to 
the extent of causing decarburization. Chips must be well 
niixed, and those too coarse to pass a No. 10 (2.00 mm) 
sieve or too fine to remain on a No. 30 (600 µ,m) sieve 
are not suitable for proper analysis. Sieve size numbers 
are in accordance with Specification E 11. 
5.6 Test Methods-In case a referee analysis is required 
and agreed upon to resolve a dispute concerning the results 
of a chemical analysis, the procedure for performing the 
referee analysis must be in accordance with the latest issue 
of Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A 751, unless 
otherwise agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
6. Mechanical Properties 
6.1 The mechanical property requirements, number of 
specimens, test locations, and specimen orientation shall 
be in accordance with the applicable product specification. 
6.2 Unless otherwise specified in the applicable product 
specification, test specimens must be prepared in accor­
dance with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
6.3 Mechanical tests shall be conducted in accordance 
with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
6.4 Bend tests, where required, shall be conducted in 
compliance with Test Methods E 290. 
6.5 To determine conformance with the product speci­
fication, a calculated value should be rounded to the nearest 
1 ksi [7 MPa] tensile strength and yield point or yield 
strength, and to the nearest unit in the right hand place of 
figures used in expressing the limiting value for other val­
ues in accordance with the rounding off method given in 
Practice E 29. 
6.6 Structural steels are commonly fabricated by cold 
bending. There are many interrelated factors that affect the 
ability of a given steel to cold form over a given radius 
under shop conditions. These factors include thickness, 
strength level, degree of restraint, relationship to rolling 
direction, chemistry, and microstructure. Each of the appro­
priate product specifications lists in the appendix the sug­
gested minimum inside radius for cold bending. These radii 
should be used as minima for 90° bends. They presuppose 
"hard way" bending (bend axis parallel to rolling direction) 
and reasonably good shop forming practices. Where possi­
ble, the use of larger radii or "easy way" bends are recom­
mended for improved performance. 
6.7 Fabricators should be aware that cracks may initiate 
upon bending a sheared or burned edge. This is not consid­
ered to be a fault of the steel but is rather a function of 
the induced cold-work or heat-affected zone. 
7. Dimensions, Tolerances, and Allowances 
7 .1 Dimensions, tolerances, and allowances applicable 
to products covered by this specification are contained in 
Table 2 through Table 9 [Annex Al, Tables Al.1 through 
Al.7]. The appropriate tolerance tables shall be identified 
in each individual specification. 
8. Workmanship 
8.1 Cut lengths shall have a workmanlike appearance 
and shall not have imperfections of a nature or degree for 
the product, the grade, and the quality ordered that will be 
detlimental to the fabrication of the finished part. 
8.2 Coils may contain some abnormal imperfections 
that render a portion of the coil unusable since the inspec­
tion of coils does not afford the producer the same opportu­
nity to remove portions containing imperfections as in the 
case with cut lengths. 
9. Finish and Condition 
9.1 Hot-rolled stlip has a surface with an oxide or scale 
resulting from the hot-rolling operation. The oxide or scale 
can be removed by pickling or blast cleaning when required 
1224

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-749/SA-749M 
for press-work operations or welding. Hot-rolled and hot­
rolled descaled strip are not generally used for exposed 
parts where surface is of prime importance. However, hot­
rolled surface might be of importance, as in the case of 
weathering steels for exposed parts. 
9.1.1 Hot-rolled strip can be supplied with mill 
edges, square edges, or cut (slit) edges as specified. 
9.1.1.1 Mill edges are the natural edges resulting 
from the hot-rolling operation and are generally round and 
smooth without any definite contour. 
9.1.1.2 Square edges are the edges resulting from 
rolling through vertical edging rolls during the hot-rolling 
operations. These edges are square and smooth, with the 
comers slightly rounded. 
9.1.1.3 Cut (slit) edges are the normal edges that 
result from the shearing, slitting, or trimming of mill edges. 
9.1.2 The ends of plain hot-rolled mill-edge coils 
are irregular in shape and are referred to as uncropped 
ends. Where such ends are not acceptable, the purchaser's 
order should so specify. Processed coils such as pickled 
or blast cleaned are supplied with square-cut ends. 
9.2 Oiling: 
9.2.1 Plain hot-rolled strip is customarily furnished 
not oiled. Oiling must be specified when required 
9.2.2 Hot-rolled pickled or descaled strip is custom­
arily furnished oiled. If the product is not to be oiled, it 
must be so specified since the cleaned surface is prone to 
rusting. 
10. General Requirements for Delivery 
10.1 Products covered by this specification are pro­
duced to inch-pound or metric decimal thickness only. 
10.2 Steel may be produced as ingot-cast or strand­
cast. When different grades of strand-cast steel are sequen­
tially cast, identification and separation of the transition 
material is required. 
11. Retests 
11.1 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws, it must be discarded and another specimen 
substituted. 
11.2 If the percentage of elongation of any tension test 
specimen is less than that specified and any part of the 
fracture is more than [nl]P in. [20 mm] from the center of 
the gage length of a 2 in. [50 mm] specimen or is outside 
the middle half of the gage length of an 8 in. [200 mm] 
specimen, as indicated by scribe scratches marked on the 
specimen before testing, a retest is allowed. 
11.3 If a bend specimen fails, due to conditions of 
bending more severe than required by the specification, a 
retest is permitted either on a duplicate specimen or on a 
remaining portion of the failed specimen. 
12. Inspection 
12.1 When the purchaser's order stipulates that inspec­
tion and test (except product analyses) for acceptance on 
the steel be made prior to shipment from the mill, the 
manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's inspector all rea­
sonable facilities to satisfy him that the steel is being pro­
duced and furnished in accordance with the specification. 
Mill inspection by the purchaser shall not interfere unneces­
sarily with the manufacturer's operation. 
13. Rejection and Rehearing 
13.1 Unless otherwise specified, any rejection shall be 
reported to the manufacturer within a reasonable time after 
receipt of material by the purchaser. 
13.2 Material that is reported to be defective subsequent 
to the acceptance at the purchaser's works shall be set 
aside, adequately protected, and correctly identified. The 
manufacturer shall be notified as soon as possible so that 
an investigation may be initiated. 
13.3 Samples that are representative of the rejected 
material shall be made available to the manufacturer. In 
the event that the manufacturer is dissatisfied with the 
rejection, he may request a rehearing. 
14. Test Reports and Certification 
14.1 When test reports are required by the purchase 
order or the material specification, the supplier shall report 
the results of all tests required by the material specification 
and the order. 
14.2 When certification is required by the purchase 
order, the supplier shall furnish a certification that the 
material has been manufactured and tested in accordance 
with the requirements of the material specification. 
14.3 A signature is not required on test reports or 
certifications. However, the document shall clearly identify 
the organization submitting the document. Notwithstand­
ing the absence of a signature, the organization submitting 
the document is responsible for the content of the doc­
ument. 
14.4 When test reports are required, copies of the origi­
nal material manufacturer's test report shall be included 
with any subsequent test report. 
14.5 A material test report, certificate of inspection, or 
similar document printed from or used in electronic form 
1225

=== Page 1298 ===

SA-749/SA-749M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
from an electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission 
shall be regarded as having the same validity as a counter­
part printed in the certifier's facility. The content of the 
EDI transmitted document must meet the requirements of 
the invoked ASTM standard(s) and conform to any existing 
EDI agreement between the purchaser and the supplier. 
Notwithstanding the absence of a signature, the organiza­
tion submitting the EDI transmission is responsible for the 
content of the report. 
NOTE 2-The industry definition as invoked here is: EDI is the computer 
to computer exchange of business information in an agreed upon standard 
format such as ANSI ASC Xl2. 
15. Marking 
15.1 As a minimum requirement, the material shall 
be identified by having the manufacturer's name, ASTM 
designation, weight, purchaser's order number, and mate­
rial identification legibly stenciled on top of each lift or 
shown on a tag attached to each coil or shipping unit. 
15.2 When specified in the contract or order, and for 
direct procurement by or direct shipment to the govern­
ment, marking for shipment, in addition to requirements 
specified in the contract or order, shall be in accordance 
with MIL-STD-129 for military agencies and in accordance 
with Fed. Std. No. 123 for civil agencies. 
15.3 For Government procurement by the Defense Sup­
ply Agency, strip material shall be continuously marked

16.1 Unless otherwise specified, the strip shall be pack­
aged and loaded in accordance with Practices A 700. 
16.2 When specified in the contract or order, and for 
direct procurement by or direct shipment to the govern­
ment, when Level A is specified, preservation, packaging, 
and packing shall be in accordance with the Level A 
requirements of MIL-STD-163. 
16.3 When coils are ordered it is customary to specify 
a minimum or range of inside diameter, maximum outside 
diameter, and a maximum coil weight, if required. The 
ability of manufacturers to meet the maximum coil weights 
depends upon individual mill equipment. When required, 
minimum coil weights are subject to negotiation.

It is obtained by placing an 8 ft straightedge on the concave side 
and measuring the maximum distance between the strip edge and the

A When the camber tolerances shown in the above table are not 
suitable for a particular purpose, hot-rolled strip is sometimes 
machine straightened. 
8 For strip less than 8 ft tolerances are to be established in each

Resolved Notes (AI-verified)
NOTE 1 (page 1288)
NOTE 1 - If the service environment in which the material is to be 
used is considered conducive to stress-corrosion cracking, precipitation 
hardening should be performed at a temperature that will minimize the 
susceptibility of the material to this type of attack. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification.
