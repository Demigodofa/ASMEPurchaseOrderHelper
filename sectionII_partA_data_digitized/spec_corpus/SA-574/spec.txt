SPECIFICATION FOR ALLOY STEEL 
SOCKET-HEAD CAP SCREWS 
SA-574 
(Identical with ASTM Specification A 574-04e 1 except that Table 1 on chemical requirements has been deleted and Supplementary Requirement Sl 
is now mandatory. Paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2 have been revised to refer to Table S 1. 1 and para. 6.3 has been deleted.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers the requirements for 
quenched and tempered alloy steel hexagon socket-head 
cap screws, 0.060 through 4 in. in diameter where high 
strength is required. 
NOTE 1 - A complete metric companion to Specification A 574 has 
been developed-A 574M; therefore no metric equivalents are presented 
in this specification. 
1.2 The following hazard caveat pertains only to the 
test method portion, Section 12, of this specification. This 
standard does not purport to address all of the safety 
concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsi­
bility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate 
safety and health practices and determine the applicability 
of regulatory limitations prior to use.

4.2.8 For establishment of a part identifying system, 
see ASME B 18.24 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 The screws shall be fabricated from a steel which 
has been made by the open-hearth, basic-oxygen, or elec­
tric-furnace process. 
5.2 The screws shall be fabricated from alloy steel 
made to a fine grain practice. In the event of controversy 
over grain size, referee tests on finished screws conducted 
in accordance with Test Methods E 112 shall prevail. 
5.3 Unless otherwise specified, the heads of screws 
through 1.500 in. diameter shall be fabricated by hot or 
cold forging. Over 1.500 in. diameter, the heads may be 
fabricated by hot or cold forging or by machining. Sockets 
may be forged or machined. 
5.4 Unless otherwise specified, threads of screws shall 
be rolled for diameters through 0.625 in. and for screw 
lengths through 4 in. For diameters and lengths other than 
this, threads may be rolled, cut, or ground. 
5.5 The screws shall be heat treated by oil quenching 
from above the transformation temperature and then tem­
pering at a temperature not lower than 650°F. 
5.6 Standard Finishes - Unless otherwise specified, 
the screws shall be furnished with one of the following 
"standard surfaces as manufactured" at the option of the 
manufacturer: ( 1) bright uncoated, (2) thermal black oxide, 
or (3) chemical black oxide. Hydrogen embrittlement tests 
shall not be required for screws furnished in these condi­
tions. 
5.1 Protective Coatings: 
5. 7 .1 When a protective finish other than as specified 
in 5.6 is required, it shall be specified on the purchase 
order with the applicable finish specification. 
5.7.2 When protective or decorative coatings are 
applied to the screws, precautions specified by the coating 
requirements to minimize embrittlement shall be exercised. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The analysis of the screw material shall conform 
to the chemical composition specified in Table S 1.1. 
6.2 Product analyses may be made by the purchaser 
from finished material representing each lot. The chemical 
composition, thus determined, shall conform to the require­
ments prescribed for product analysis in Table S 1.1. 
6.3 DELETED 
6.4 Application of heats of steel to which bismuth, 
selenium, tellurium, or lead has been intentionally added 
shall not be permitted. 
6.5 Chemical analyses shall be performed in accor­
dance with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology 
A 751. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 The hardness of finished screws shall be 39 to 
45 HRC for 0.500 in. and smaller and 37 to 45 HRC for 
0.625 in. and larger. This shall be only the mechanical 
requirements for screws that are shorter than three times 
the diameter or that have insufficient threads for tension 
testing. 
7.2 Screws, other than those exempted in 7.1 and 7.3, 
shall meet the proof load and tensile requirements in Table 
2 and Table 3. The screws shall be tension tested with a 
wedge of the angle specified in Table 4 under the head. 
To meet the requirements of the wedge test, there must be 
a tensile failure in the body or thread section. For the. 
purpose of this test, failure means separation into two 
pieces. Screws threaded to the head shall pass the require­
ments for this test if the fracture that caused failure origi­
nated in the thread area, even though it may have 
propagated into the fillet area or the head before separation. 
7 .3 Screws having a diameter larger than 1.500 in. 
shall be preferably tested in full size and shall meet the 
requirements of Table 2 and Table 3. When equipment of 
sufficient capacity is not readily available, screws shall 
meet 170 ksi, min, tensile strength, 153 ksi, min, yield 
strength at 0.2% offset, and 10% elongation on specimens 
machined in accordance with Test Methods F 606. 
8. Metallurgical Requirement 
8.1 Carburization or Decarburization: 
8.1.1 There shall be no evidence of carburization or 
total decarburization on the surfaces of the heat-treated 
screws when measured in accordance with 12.3. 
8.1.2 The depth of partial decarburization shall be 
limited to the values in Table 5 when measured as shown 
in Fig. 1 and in accordance with 12.3. 
9. Dimensions 
9.1 Unless otherwise specified, the product shall con­
form to the requirements of Bl8.3. 
9.2 Unless otherwise specified, threads shall be Unified 
standard: Class 3A, UNRC and UNRF series for screw 
sizes 0.060 through 1 in. inclusive; Class 2A, UNRC and 
UNRF series for sizes over 1 in. to 1.500 in. inclusive; 
and Class 2A UNRC series for sizes larger than 1.500 in. 
in accordance with B 1. 1.

10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
10.1 Discontinuities - The surface discontinuities for 
these products shall conform to Specification 
F 788/F 788M and the additional limitations specified 
herein. 
10.2 Socket Discontinuities: 
10.2.1 Depth of discontinuities in the socket area 
will be permissible within the limits of Condition 1 pro­
vided they do not affect the usability and performance of 
the screw. Discontinuities exceeding these limits are not 
acceptable. 
10.2.2 Longitudinal discontinuities must not exceed 
0.25T in length. Permissible and nonpermissible disconti­
nuities are shown in Fig. 2. 
NOTE 2 - T = actual key engagement. 
10.3 Permissible Head and Body Discontinuities- Dis­
continuities as defined above are permitted in the locations 
illustrated in Fig. 3 to the depths shown in 10.4. These 
discontinuities are permitted, provided they do not affect 
the usability and performance of the screw. All discontinu­
ities are to be measured perpendicular to indicated surfaces. 
10.4 Conditions for Permissible Discontinuity Depths: 
10.4.1 Condition 1 - For bearing area, fillet, and 
other surfaces, max depth = 0.03D or 0.005 in. (whichever 
is greater). 
NOTE 3 - D = nominal diameter of screw. 
10.4.2 Condition 2 - For peripheral discontinuities, 
max depth = 0.06D, but not to exceed 0.064. 
10.5 Thread Discontinuities - Threads shall have no 
laps at the root or on the flanks located below the pitch 
line. Laps are permissible at the thread crest to a depth of 
25% of the basic thread height and on the thread flanks 
beyond the pitch diameter. Longitudinal seams in the 
threads are acceptable within the limits of Condition 1 
(10.4.1). 
11. Number of Tests and Retests 
11.1 The requirements of this specification shall be met 
in continuous mass production for stock, and the manufac­
turer shall make sample inspections to ensure that the prod­
uct conforms to the specified requirements. Additional tests 
of individual shipments of material are not ordinalily con­
templated. A record of individual heats of steel in each 
test lot shall be maintained. The container shall be coded 
to permit identification of the lot. 
11.2 When specified in the order, the manufacturer 
shall furnish a test report certified to be the last complete 
set of mechanical tests for each stock size in each shipment. 
11.3 When additional tests are specified on the purchase 
order, a lot, for purposes of selecting test samples, shall 
consist of all screws offered for inspection at one time of 
one diameter and length. From each lot, the number of 
samples for each requirement shall be as follows: 
Number of Pieces in Lot 
800 and less 
Over 800 to 8 000, incl. 
Over 8 000 to 22 000, incl. 
Over 22 000 
Number of Samples 
1 
2 
3 
5 
11.4 Should any sample fail to meet the requirements 
of a specified test, double the number of samples from the 
same lot shall be retested for the requirement(s) in which 
it failed. All of the additional samples shall conform to 
the specification or the lot shall be rejected. 
12. Test Methods 
12.1 Test the finished screws and specimens, as applica­
ble, for mechanical properties and hardness requirements 
of Section 7. Testing shall be in accordance with Test 
Methods F 606 at room temperature. The minimum 
required length for tension testing shall be 3D. The angle 
used in wedge tests shall be as specified in Table 4. 
12.2 The speed of testing, as determined with a free 
running crosshead, shall be a maximum of 1 in./min for 
the tension tests of screws. 
12.3 Decarburization and carburization tests shall be 
conducted as follows: 
12.3.1 Section the thread area of the bolt longitudi­
nally through the axis, mount, and polish it in accordance 
with Practice E 3. Take measurements (1) at the minor 
diameter in the center of the thread ridge, and (2) 0.75h 
toward the thread crest on the perpendicular bisector of 
the thread ridge. Take a measurement ( 3) on the thread 
flank approximately at the pitch line at a depth of 0.003 in. 
Use one of the two methods for carburization/decarburiza­
tion evaluation either optical or microhardness measure­
ments. The microhardness measurement shall constitute a 
referee method in case of dispute. 
12.3.2 For optical measurement, etch the section in 
2 to 4% nital. Examine the surface of the etched samples 
under a microscope at IO0x using a measuring eyepiece 
graduated in 0.001-in. increments. The width of any light 
etching band normally defines the decarburization depth. A 
dark etching band indicates the possibility of carburization. 
12.3.3 Measure microhardness in accordance with 
Test Method E 384 on unetched specimens using a DPH 
136° indenter or a Knoop indenter using the following load 
application:

(Reading No. 1) on the thread crest bisector to determine 
base metal hardness. Take measurements (Reading No. 2) 
on the bisector 0.75h from the minor measurement toward 
the thread crest. Also take measurements (Reading No. 3) 
on the thread flank at the pitch line at a depth within 0.003 
from the surface. Reading No. 3 may be taken on the same 
or an adjacent thread. 
12.3.4 Interpret microhardness readings as follows: 
12.3.4.1 A decrease of more than 30 hardness 
points from Reading No. 1 to Reading No. 2 shall be 
regarded as decarburization and indicates the screw does 
not conform to specification requirements. 
12.3.4.2 An increase of more than 30 hardness 
points from Reading No. 1 to Reading No. 3 shall be 
regarded as carburization and indicates that the screw does 
not conform to specification requirements. 
13. Inspection 
13.l If the additional tests described in 11.3 are required 
by the purchaser it shall be specified in the inquiry, order, 
or contract. 
13.2 The inspector representing the purchaser shall

that concern the manufacture of the material ordered. The 
manufacturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facili­
ties to satisfy him that the material is being furnished in 
accordance with this specification. All tests and inspections 
required by the specification that are requested by the pur­
chaser's representative shall be made before shipment, and 
shall be conducted as not to interfere unnecessarily with 
the operation of the works. 
14. Responsibility 
14.1 The party responsible for the fastener shall be the 
organization that supplies the fastener to the purchaser.

or pipe which do not meet the requirements of the specification 
shall be rejected. 
5.4 Supplying an alloy grade of steel that specifically 
requires the addition of any element other than those listed in 
Table 2 is not permitted. 
6. Mechanical Requirements 
6.1 Tensile Properties: 
6.1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in Table 3. 
6.1.2 The yield strength shall be determined by the drop of 
the beam, by the halt in the gauge of the testing machine, by the 
use of dividers, or by other approved methods. When a definite 
yield point is not exhibited, the yield strength corresponding to 
a permanent offset of 0.2 % of the gauge length of the 
specimen, or to a total extension of 0.5 % of the gauge length 
under load, shall be determined. 
6.1.3 If the percentage of elongation of any test specimen is 
less than that specified and any part of the fracture is more than 
¾ in. ( 19 mm) from the center of the gauge length, as indicated 
by scribe marks on the specimen before testing, a retest shall be 
allowed.

6.2 Flattening Test: 
6.2.1 A section of pipe not less than 4 in. (102 mm) in length 
shall be flattened cold between parallel plates in two steps. The 
weld shall be placed 90° from the direction of the applied 
force. During the first step, which is a test for ductility, no 
cracks or breaks, except as provided for in 6.2.5, shall occur on 
the inside or outside surfaces until the distance between the 
plates is less than the value of H, calculated by the following 
equation: 
H = [(1 +e)t]l[e+t!D] (1) 
where: 
H = distance between flattening plates, in., 
t = specified wall thickness of the pipe, in., 
D = specified outside diameter of the pipe, in., and 
e = deformation per unit length (0.09 for low-carbon steel). 
6.2.2 During the second step, which is a test for soundness, 
the flattening shall be continued until the specimen breaks or 
the opposite walls of the pipe meet. Evidence of laminated or 
unsound material, or of incomplete weld that is revealed during 
the entire flattening test shall be cause for rejection. 
6.2.3 Surface imperfections in the test specimens before 
flattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening 
test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements. 
6.2.4 Superficial ruptures resulting from surface imperfec­
tions shall not be cause for rejection. 
6.2.5 When low D-to- t ratio tubulars are tested, because the 
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the 
inside surface at the 6 and 12 o'clock locations, cracks at these 
locations shall not be cause for rejection if the D-to-t ratio is 
less than 10. 
6.3 Reverse Flattening Test-A section 4 in. ( 102 mm) in 
length of pipe in sizes down to and including 13 /16 in. (20.6 mm) 
in outside diameter shall be split longitudinally 90° on each 
side of the weld and the sample opened and flattened with the 
weld at the point of maximum bend. There shall be no evidence 
of cracks or lack of penetration or overlaps resulting from flash 
removal in the weld. 
6.4 Flange Test-A section of pipe not less than 4 in. (102 
mm) in length shall be capable of having a flange turned over 
at a right angle to the body of the pipe without cracking or 
showing flaws. This flange, as measured from the outside of the 
pipe, shall be not less than Vs in. (3.2 mm) nor more than½ in. 
(12.7 mm). Within these limits, the width of the flange shall be 
not less than the percentages specified in Table 4. 
7. Dimensions and Permissible Variations 
7.1 Permissible Variations in Outside Diameter and Wall 
Thickness-The outside diameter and wall thickness variations 
shall not exceed the limits prescribed in Table 1.

7 .2 Permissible Variations in Straightness-Bach pipe shall 
be straight within 0.030 in. (0.76 mm) maximum deflection in 
any 3 ft (0.91 m) length to 8 NPS. For 8 NPS and above, pipe 
shall be straight within 0.060 in. (1.52 mm) maximum deflec­
tion in any 3 ft (0.91 m) length. Galvanized pipe shall be 
reasonably straight. 
7.3 Lengths: 
7.3.1 Pipe may be ordered in definite cut lengths or in 
random lengths as provided herein. 
7.3.2 When ordered in definite cut lengths, the variation in 
length shall not exceed the amounts prescribed in Table 5. 
7.3.3 If definite lengths are not required, pipe may be 
ordered in single random lengths of 16 to 22 ft (4.9 to 6.7 m) 
with 5 % 12 to 16 ft (3.7 to 4.9 m), or in double random lengths 
with a minimum average of 35 ft (10.7 m) and a minimum 
length of 22 ft (6.7 m) with 5 % 16 to 22 ft (4.9 to 6.7 m). 
8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
8.1 The finished pipe shall be free of injurious defects and 
shall have a workman-like finish. Minor defects may be 
removed by grinding, provided the wall thickness is not 
reduced to less than the minimum thickness permitted for the 
ordered nominal wall thickness. 
8.2 The pipe shall have smooth ends free of burrs and free 
of scale except that the pipe may have a superficial "blue" 
oxide film on the surfaces. 
8.3 For NPS ½ to 1 ½ inclusive, the inside diameter welding 
flash shall be removed so that the remaining flash does not 
exceed 0.006 in. (0.15 mm). For NPS over 1 ½, the remaining 
inside diameter welding flash shall not exceed 0.010 in. (0.25 
mm). 
8.4 For all nominal sizes, the outside diameter welding flash 
shall be removed flush with the outside diameter contour. 
8.5 Undercut flash must be smoothly blended into the pipe 
wall. 
8.6 The intent of the flash conditions as prescribed in 8.3, 
8.4, and 8.5 is to obtain a surface contour suitable for flanging. 
9. Number of Tests 
9.1 Two tensile tests as specified in 6.1 shall be made from 
each heat. 
9 .2 The flattening test as specified in 6.2 shall be made on 
two lengths of pipe from each lot of 250 lengths or fraction 
thereof.

A These permissible variations In length apply to pipe before bending. They 
apply to cut lengths up to and including 24 ft (7.3 m). For lengths over 24 ft, an 
additional over-tolerance of 1/a in. for each 1 O ft (3.0 m) or fraction thereof shall be 
permissible, up to a maximum of½ in. (12.7 mm).

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-587 
9.3 The reverse flattening test specified in 6.3 shall be made 
on 1 length of pipe from each lot of 250 lengths or fraction 
thereof. 
9.4 The flange test as specified in 6.4 shall be made on 
specimens from 2 lengths of pipe from each lot of 250 lengths 
or fraction thereof. 
10. Retests 
10.1 If the results of the mechanical tests of any heat or lot 
do not conform to the requirements specified, retests may be 
made on additional pipe of double the original number from the 
same heat or lot, each of which shall conform to the require­
ments specified. 
11. Retreatment 
11.1 If a heat or lot fails to conform to the test requirements, 
that heat or lot may be reheat treated and resubmitted for tests. 
Not more than one reheat treatment shall be permitted. 
12. Test Specimens and Methods of Testing 
12.1 The test specimens and the tests required by this 
specification shall conform to those described in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370. 
12.2 Test specimens shall be taken from the ends of finished 
pipe prior to upsetting, swaging, expanding, or other forming 
operations, or being cut to length. They shall be smooth on the 
ends and free from burrs and flaws. 
12.3 If any test specimen shows flaws or defective machin­
ing, it may be discarded and another specimen substituted. 
13. Nondestructive Test 
13.1 The nondestructive test shall be made instead of the 
hydrostatic test. 
13.1.1 The test shall provide a 360° inspection for sizes up 
to and including 3½ in. (88.9 mm) outside diameter. 
13.1.2 For pipe larger than 3½ in. (88.9 mm) outside 
diameter, nondestructive inspection of the weld and heat 
affected zone is required. 
13.2 Each pipe shall be tested with a nondestructive test in 
accordance with Practices E213, E273, E309, or E570. Except 
as provided in 13.6.2, it is the intent of this test to reject pipe 
with imperfections that produce test signals equal to or greater 
than that of the calibration standard. In order to accommodate 
the various types of nondestructive testing equipment and 
techniques in use, and manufacturing practices employed, any 
one of the following calibration standards may be used, at the 
option of the producer, to establish a minimum sensitivity level 
for rejection: 
13.3 For eddy-current testing, the calibration pipe shall 
contain, at the option of the producer, any one of the following 
discontinuities to establish a minimum sensitivity level for 
rejection. For welded pipe, they shall be placed in the weld if 
visible. 
13.3.1 Drilled Hole-A hole not larger than 0.031 in. (0.79 
mm) in diameter shall be drilled radially and completely 
through the pipe wall, taking care to avoid distortion of the 
pipe while drilling. 
13.3.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool or 
file with a ¼-in. 6.4 mm diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe, preferably in the weld area. Said notch 
shall have a depth not exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall 
thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. (0.10 mm), whichever is 
greater. 
13.3.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. (0.79 mm) or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
pipe axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to a depth not 
exceeding 121/2 % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.004 in. (0.102 mm), whichever is greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
13.4 For ultrasonic testing, the longitudinal calibration ref­
erence notches shall be at the option of the producer, any one 
of the three common notch shapes shown in Practices E213 or 
E273. The depth of the notch shall not exceed 12½ % of the 
specified wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. (0.102 mm), 
whichever is greater. For welded pipe, the notch shall be placed 
in the weld, if visible. 
13.5 For flux leakage testing, each of the longitudinal 
calibration notches shall be a straight-sided notch not over 12½ 
% of the wall thickness in depth and not over 1.0 in. (25 mm) 
in length. Both outside diameter and inside diameter notches 
shall be placed in the tube located sufficiently apart to enable 
separation and identification of the signals. 
13.6 Pipe producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
calibration defect shall be subject to rejection. The area 
producing the signal may be examined. 
13.6.1 Test signals produced by imperfections that cannot 
be identified, or produced by cracks or crack-like defects shall 
result in rejection of the pipe subject to rework and retest. 
13.6.2 Test signals produced by imperfections such as those 
listed below may be judged as injurious or noninjurious 
depending on visual observation or their severity or the type of 
signal they produce on the testing equipment used, or both: 
13.6.2.1 Dinges, 
13.6.2.2 Straightener marks, 
13.6.2.3 Loose inside diameter bead and cutting chips, 
13.6.2.4 Scratches, 
13.6.2.5 Steel die stamps, 
13.6.2.6 Chattered flash him, 
13.6.2.7 Stop marks, or 
13.6.2.8 Tube reducer ripple. 
13.6.3 Any imperfection of the above type exceeding 
0.004 in. (0.102 mm) or 12½ % of the specified wall thickness 
(whichever is greater) in depth shall be considered injurious. 
13.6.3.1 If the imperfection is judged as injurious, the pipe 
shall be rejected but may be reconditioned and retested 
providing the dimensional requirements are met. 
13.6.3.2 If the imperfection is explored to the extent that it 
can be identified as noninjurious, the pipe may be accepted 
without further test providing the imperfection does not en­
croach on the minimum wall thickness. 
14. Inspection 
14.1 The inspector shall have entry at all times while work 
on an order is being done to all parts of the manufacturer's

7.2.1 Samples for mechanical test specimens shall be 
removed after the quenching and tempering heat treatment. 
The purchaser shall specify any additional thermal treat­
ments that shall be given to the heat treated test specimens. 
(This is intended to simulate subsequent thermal treatments 
which may be perfonned by the fabricator.) 
7 .2.2 Samples shall be removed so that the test speci­
mens will have their major axes parallel to the direction 
of major working of the forging. 
7.2.3 Test specimens may be machined from a pro­
duction forging, or prolongation thereof, or from special 
forged blocks suitably worked and heat treated with the 
production forgings. Such special blocks shall be obtained 
from an ingot, slab, or billet from the same heat as the 
forgings they represent and shall be reduced by forging in 
a manner similar to that for the products to be represented. 
The forging reduction for a special test block shall not 
exceed the minimum forging reduction of the forgings 
represented, and its thickness shall not be less than the 
maximum thickness of the forgings represented. If a forg­
ing is tested, the tests must represent the maximum section 
thickness in the lot. All test specimens shall be located at 
the mid-plane of the thickness and, the mid length position 
of the gauge length ffoor tension test specimens, or the 
notch of the Charpy V-notch impact test specimens shall 
be at least T from any second surface of the production 
forging or test block, where T equals the maximum heat 
treated thickness of the forging.

1. Scope 
1.1 This practice covers the standards and procedures 
for the pulse-echo ultrasonic examination of heat-treated 
carbon, low-alloy, and martensitic stainless steel castings 
by the longitudinal-beam technique. 
1.2 This practice is to be used whenever the inquiry, 
contract, order, or specification states that castings are to 
be subjected to ultrasonic examination in accordance with 
Practice A 609 / A 609M. 
1.3 This practice contains two procedures for ultrasonic 
inspection of carbon, low-alloy, and martensitic stainless 
steel castings, that is, Procedure A and Procedure B. Proce­
dure A is the original A 609 / A 609M practice and requires 
calibration using a series of test blocks containing flat 
bottomed holes. It also provides supplementary require­
ments for angle beam testing. Procedure B requires calibra­
tion using a back wall reflection from a series of solid 
calibration blocks. 
NOTE 1 - illtrasonic examination and radiography are not directly 
comparable. This examination technique is intended to complement Guide 
E 94 in the detection of discontinuities. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with this practice. . 
1.5 This standard does not purport to address all of 
the safety problems, if any, associated with its use. It is 
the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish 
appropriate safety and health practices and determine the 
applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.

ment that is capable of generating, receiving, and ampli­
fying frequencies of at least 1 to 5 MHz. 
4.1.2 The ultrasonic instrument shall provide linear 
presentation (within ±5%) for at least 75% of the screen 
height (sweep line to top of screen). Linearity shall be 
determined in accordance with Practice E 317 or equivalent 
electronic means. 
4.1.3 The electronic apparatus shall contain a signal 
attenuator or calibrated gain control that shall be accurate 
over its useful range to ±10% of the nominal attenuation 
or gain ratio to allow measurement of signals beyond the 
linear range of the instrument. 
4.2 Search Units: 
4.2.1 Longitudinal Wave, internally grounded, having 
a ½ to 1½ in. [13 to 28 mm] diameter or 1 in. [25 mm]

noise ratio of the response pattern of the casting, a fre­
quency in the range from 1 to 5 MHz shall be used. The 
background noise shall not exceed 25% of the distance 
amplitude correction curve (DAC). Transducers shall be 
utilized at their rated frequencies. 
4.2.2 Dual-Element, 5 MHz, ½, by 1 in. [13 by 
25 mm], 12° included angle search units are recommended 
for sections 1 in. [25 mm] and under. 
4.2.3 Other frequencies and sizes of search units may 
be used for evaluating and pinpointing indications. 
4.3 Reference Blocks: 
4.3.1 Reference blocks containing flat-bottom holes 
shall be used to establish test sensitivity in accordance 
with 8.2. 
4.3.2 Reference blocks shall be made from cast steels 
that give an acoustic response similar to the castings being 
examined. 
4.3.3 The design of reference blocks shall be in 
accordance with Fig. 1, and the basic set shall consist of 
those blocks listed in Table 1. When section thicknesses 
over 15 in. [380 mm] are to be inspected, an additional 
block of the maximum test thickness shall be made to 
supplement the basic set. 
4.3.4 Machined blocks with ¾ 2 in. [2.4 mm] diameter 
flat-bottom holes at depths from the entry surface of ½ in. 
[3 mm], ½ in. [13 mm], or ½t and ¾ in. [19 mm], or ¾t 
( where t = thickness of the block) shall be used to establish 
the DAC for the dual-element search units (see Fig. 2). 
4.3.5 Each reference block shall be permanently 
identified along the side of the block indicating the material 
and the block identification. 
4.4 Couplant - A suitable couplant having good wet­
ting characteristics shall be used between the search unit 
and examination surface. The same couplant shall be used 
for calibrations and examinations. 
5. Personnel Requirements 
5.1 The manufacturer shall be responsible for assigning 
qualified personnel to perform ultrasonic examination in 
conformance with the requirements of this practice. 
5.2 Personnel performing ultrasonic examinations in 
accordance with this practice shall be familiar with the 
following: 
5.2.1 Ultrasonic terminology. 
5.2.2 Instrument calibration. 
5.2.3 Effect of transducer material, size, frequency, 
and mode on test results. 
5.2.4 Effect of material structure (grain size, cleanli-
ness, etc.) on test results. 
5.2.5 Effect of test distance on test results. 
5.2.6 Effect of nonlinearity on test results. 
5.2.7 Effect of thickness and orientation of disconti­
nuities on test results. 
5.2.8 Effect of surface roughness on test results. 
5.3 A qualification record (see Note 2) of personnel 
considered suitable by the manufacturer to perform exami­
nations in accordance with this practice shall be available • 
upon request. 
NOTE 2 - SNT-TC-lA, Ultrasonic Testing Method, provides a recom­
mended procedure for qualifying personnel. Other personnel qualification 
requirement documents may be used when agreed upon between the 
purchaser and the supplier. 
6. Casting Conditions 
6.1 Castings shall receive at least an austenitizing heat 
treatment before being ultrasonically examined. 
6.2 Test surfaces of castings shall be free of material 
that will interfere with the ultrasonic examination. They 
may be as cast, blasted, ground, or machined. 
1035

=== Page 1130 ===

SA-609 /SA-609M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
6.3 The ultrasonic examination shall be conducted prior 
to machining that prevents an effective examination of the 
casting. 
7. Test Conditions 
7.1 To assure complete coverage of the specified cast­
ing section, each pass of the search unit shall overlap by 
at least 10% of the width of the transducer. 
7.2 The rate of scanning shall not exceed 6 in.ls 
(150 mm/s). 
7.3 The ultrasonic beam shall be introduced perpendic­
ular to the examination surface. 
8. Procedure 
8.1 Adjust the instrument controls to position the first 
back reflection for the thickness to be tested at least one 
half of the distance across the cathode ray tube. 
8.2 Using the set of reference blocks spanning the 
thickness of the casting being inspected, mark the flat­
bottom hole indication height for each of the applicable 
blocks on the cathode ray tube shield. Draw a curve through 
these marks on the screen or on suitable graph paper. The 
maximum signal amplitude for the test blocks used shall 
peak at approximately three-fomths of the screen height 
above the sweep by use of the attenuator. This curve shall 
be referred to as the 100% distance amplitude correction 
(DAC) curve. If the attenuation of ultrasound in the casting 
thickness being examined is such that the system's dynamic 
range is exceeded, segmented DAC curves are permitted. 
8.3 The casting examination surface will normally be 
rougher than that of the test blocks; consequently, employ 
a transfer mechanism to provide approximate compensa­
tion. In order to accomplish this, first select a region of 
the casting that has parallel walls and a surface condition 
representative of the rest of the casting as a transfer point. 
Next, select the test block whose overall length, C (Fig. 
1), most closely matches the reflection amplitude through 
the block length. Place the search unit on the casting at 
tl1e transfer point and adjust the instrument gain until the 
back reflection amplitude through the casting matches that 
through the test block. Using this transfer technique, the 
examination sensitivity in the casting may be expected to 
be within ±30% or less of that given by the test blocks. 
8.4 Do not change those instrument controls and the 
test frequency set during calibration, except the attenuator, 
or calibrated gain control, during acceptance examination 
of a given thickness of the casting. Make a periodic calibra­
tion during the inspection by checking the amplitude of 
response from the¼ in. (6.4 mm) diameter flat-bottom hole 
in the test block utilized for the transfer. 
NOTE 3 - The attenuator or calibrated gain control may be used to 
change the signal amplitude during examination to permit small amplitude 
signals to be more readily detected. Signal evaluation is made by returning 
the attenuator or calibrated gain control to its original setting. 
8.5 During examination of areas of the casting having 
parallel walls, recheck areas showing 75% or greater loss 
of back reflection to determine whether loss of back reflec­
tion is due to poor contact, insufficient couplant, misori­
ented discontinuity, etc. If the reason for loss of back 
reflection is not evident, consider the area questionable 
and further investigate. 
9. Report 
9.1 The manufacturer's report of final ultrasonic exami­
nation shall contain the following data and shall be fur­
nished to the purchaser: 
9.1.1 The total number, location, amplitude, and area 
when possible to delineate boundaries by monitoring the 
movement of the center of the search unit of all indications 
equal to or greater than 100% of the DAC. 
9.1.2 Questionable areas from 8.5 that, upon fmther 
investigation, are determined to be caused by discontinu­
ities. 
9.1.3 The examination frequency, type of instrument, 
types of search units employed, couplant, manufacturer's 
identifying numbers, purchaser's order number, and data 
and authorized signature. 
9.1.4 A sketch showing the physical outline of the 
casting, including dimensions of all areas not inspected 
due to geometric configuration, with the location and sizes 
of all indications in accordance with 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. 
10. Acceptance Standards 
10.1 This practice is intended for application to castings 
with a wide variety of sizes, shapes, compositions, melting 
processes, foundry practices, and applications. Therefore, 
it is impractical to specify an ultrasonic quality level that 
would be universally applicable to such a diversity of prod­
ucts. Ultrasonic acceptance or rejection criteria for individ­
ual castings should be based on a realistic appraisal of 
service requirements and the quality that can normally be 
obtained in production of the particular type of casting. 
10.2 Acceptance quality levels shall be established 
between the purchaser and the manufacturer on the basis 
of one or more of the following criteria: 
10.2.1 No indication equal to or greater than the 
DAC over an area specified for the applicable quality level 
of Table 2. 
10.2.2 No reduction of back reflection of 75% or 
greater that has been determined to be caused by a disconti­
nuity over an area specified for the applicable quality level 
of Table 2. 
1036

=== Page 1131 ===

ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 SA-609 /SA·609M 
10.2.3 Indications producing a continuous response 
equal to or greater than the DAC with a dimension 
exceeding the maximum length shown for the applicable 
quality level shall be unacceptable. 
10.2.4 Other criteria agreed upon between the pur­
chaser and the manufacturer. 
10.3 Other means may be used to establish the validity 
of a rejection based on ultrasonic inspection. 
NOTE 4 - The areas for the ultrasonic quality levels in Table 2 of 
Practice A 609 I A 609M refer to the surface area on the casting over 
which a continuous indication exceeding the DAC is maintained. 
NOTE 5 - Areas are to be measured from dimensions of the movement 
of the search unit by outlining locations where the amplitude of the 
indication is 100% of the DAC or where the back reflection is reduced 
by 75%, using the center of the search unit as a reference point to establish 
the outline of the indication area. 
NOTE 6 - In certain castings, because of very long metal path distances 
or curvature of the examination surfaces, the surface area over which a 
given discontinuity is detected may be considerably larger or smaller 
than the actual area of the discontinuity in the casting; in such cases, 
other criteria that incorporate a consideration of beam angles or beam 
spread must be used for realistic evaluation of the discontinuity. 
PROCEDURE B - BACK-WALL REFLECTION 
CALIBRATION PROCEDURE 
11. Apparatus 
11.1 Apparatus shall be kept on a regular six month 
maintenance cycle during which, as a minimum require­
ment, the vertical and horizontal linearities, sensitivity, 
and resolution shall be established in accordance with the 
requirements of Practice E 317. 
11.2 Search Units - Ceramic element transducers not 
exceeding 1.25 in. [82 mm] diameter or 1 in. 2 [25 mm 2 ] 
shall be used. 
11.3 Search Units Facing-A soft urethane membrane 
or neoprene sheet, approximately 0.025 in. [0.64 mm] 
thick, may be used to improve coupling and minimize 
transducer wear caused by casting surface roughness. 
11.4 Calibration/Testing -The same system, includ­
ing the urethane membrane, used for calibration shall be 
used to inspect the casting. 
11.5 Other Inspections - Other frequencies and type 
search units may be used for obtaining additional informa­
tion and pinpointing of individual indications. 
11.6 Couplant - A suitable liquid couplant, such as 
clean SAE 30 motor oil or similar commercial ultrasonic 
couplant, shall be used to couple the search unit to the test 
surface. Other couplants may be used when agreed upon 
between the purchaser and supplier. 
11.7 Reference Standards - Reference standards in 
accordance with Fig. 3 shall be used to calibrate the instru­
ment for inspecting machined and cast surfaces. Reference 
standards shall be flaw free and machined within tolerances 
indicated. 
12. Ultrasonic Instrument 
12.1 Type - Pulsed ultrasonic reflection instrument 
capable of generating, receiving, and amplifying frequen­
cies of 1 MHz to 5 MHz shall be used for testing. 
12.2 Voltage - Line voltage shall be suitably regulated 
by constant voltage equipment and metal housing must be 
grounded to prevent electric shock. 
12.3 Linearity - The instrument must provide a linear 
presentation (within ±5%) of at least 1.5 in. [40 mm] sweep 
to peak (S/P). 
12.4 Calibrated Gain Control of Attenuator - The 
instrument shall contain a calibrated gain control or signal 
attenuator ( accurate within ± 10%) which will allow indica­
tions beyond the linear range of the instrument to be mea­
sured. 
12.5 Time-Corrected Gain - The instrument shall be 
equipped to compensate for signal decay with distance. A 
method should be available to equalize signal response at 
different depths. 
13. Qualification 
13.1 The requirements for pre-production qualification 
are as follows: 
13.1.1 Personnel - The personnel qualification 
requirements of SNT-TC- lA are applicable. Other person­
nel qualification requirement documents may be used when 
agreed upon between the purchaser and the supplier. Rec­
ords of all personnel shall be available to customers upon 
request. 
13.1.2 Equipment- The equipment shall be capable 
of meeting the requirements in Section 12. 
14. Preparation 
14.1 Time of Inspection - The final ultrasonic accept­
ance inspection shall be performed after at least an austeni­
tizing heat treatment and preferably after machining. In 
order to avoid time loss in production, acceptance inspec­
tion of cast surfaces may be done prior to machining. 
Machined surfaces shall be acceptance inspected as soon 
as possible after machining. Repair welds may be inspected 
before the postweld heat treatment.

SA-609 /SA-609M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
14.2 Suiface Finish: 
14.2.1 Machined Suifaces - Machined surfaces sub­
ject to ultrasonic inspection shall have a finish that will 
produce an ultrasonic response equivalent to that obtained 
from a 250 µin. (6.3 µm) surface. The surface finish shall 
also permit adequate movement pf search units along the 
surface. 
14.2.2 Casting Suifaces - Casting surfaces to be 
ultrasonically inspected shall be suitable for the intended 
type and quality level (Tables 3 and 4) of inspection as 
judged acceptable by a qualified individual as specified in 
13.1.1. 
14.2.3 Surface Condition - All surfaces to be 
inspected shall be free of scale, machining or grinding 
particles, excessive paint thickness, dirt, or other foreign 
matter that may interfere with the inspection. 
14.3 Position of Casting - The casting shall be posi­
tioned such that the inspector has free access to the back 
wall for the purpose of verifying change in contour. 
15. Calibration 
15.1 Calibration Blocks - Determine the thickness of 
the material to be ultrasonically inspected. For material 
thickness of 3 in. [75 mm] or less, use the series of 3 
blocks, ½, 2, 5 in. [13, 50, 125 mm] (Fig. 3, B dimension) 
for calibration: For a material thickness greater than 3 in., 
use the series of 3 blocks, 2, 5, 10 in. [50, 125, 250 mm] 
(Fig. 3, B dimension) for calibration. 
15.2 Calibration of Search Units - For the thickness 
of material to be inspected, as determined in 15.1, use the 
following search units: 
15.2.1 For materials 3 in. [75 mm] or less in thick­
ness, use a 2¾ MHz, ½ in. [13 mm] diameter search unit. 
15.2.2 For material greater than 3 in. [75 mm] in 
thickness, use a 2¾ MHz, 1 in. [25 mm] diameter search 
unit. 
15.3 Calibration Procedure: 
15.3.1 Set the frequency selector as required. Set the 
reject control in the "OFF" position. 
15.3.2 Position the search unit on the entrant surface 
of the blockthat completely encompasses the metal thick­
ness to be inspected (Fig. 3) and adjust the sweep control 
such that the back reflection signal appears approximately, 
but not more than three-quarters along the sweep line from 
the initial pulse signal. 
15.3.3 Position the search unit on the entrant surface 
of the smallest block of the series of 3 blocks selected for 
calibration and adjust the gain until the back reflection 
signal height (amplitude) is 1.5 in. [40 mm] sweep to 
peak (SIP). Draw a line on the cathode-ray screen (CRT), 
parallel to the sweep line, through the peak of the 1.5 in. 
(SIP) amplitude. 
15.3.4 Position the search unit on the entrant surface 
of the largest block of the series of 3 blocks selected for 
calibration, and adjust the distance amplitude control to 
provide a back reflection signal height of 1.5 in. [40 mm] 
(SIP). 
15.3.5 Position the search unit on the entrant surface 
of the intermediate calibration block of the series of 3 
blocks being used for calibration and confirm that the back 
reflection signal height is approximately 1.5 in. [40 mm] 
(SIP). If it is not, obtain the best compromise between this 
block and the largest block of the series of 3 blocks being 
used for calibration. 
15.3.6 Draw a line on the cathode ray tube screen 
parallel to the sweep line at 0.5 in. [13 mm] (SIP) ampli­
tude. This will be the reference line for reporting disconti­
nuity amplitudes. 
15.3.7 For tests on machined suifaces, position the 
search unit on a machined surface of casting where the 
walls are reasonably parallel and adjust the gain of the 
instrument until the back reflection signal height is 1.5 in. 
[40 mm] (SIP). Increase the inspection sensitivity by a 
factor of three times (10 dB gain) with the calibrated attenu­
ator. Surfaces that do not meet the requirements of 14.2.l 
shall be inspected as specified in 15.3.s: 
15.3.8 For inspections on cast suifaces, position the 
search unit on the casting to be inspected at a location 
where the walls are reasonably parallel and smooth (inside 
and outside diameter) and the surface condition is represen­
tative of the surface being inspected. Adjust the gain of 
the instrument until the back reflection signal height is 
1.5 in. [40 mm] (SIP). Increase the inspection sensitivity 
by a factor of six times (16 dB) by use of the calibrated 
control or attenuator. A significant change in surface finish 
requires a compensating adjustment to the gain. 
15.3.8.1 Rejectable indications on as-cast surfaces 
may be reevaluated by surface preparation to 250 µin. 
[6.3 µm] finish or better, and re-inspected in accordance 
with 15.3.7 of this practice. 
15.3.8.2 It should be noted that some instruments 
are equipped with decibel calibrated gain controls, in which 
case the decibel required to increase the sensitivity must 
be added. Other instruments have decibel calibrated attenu­
ators, in which case the required decibel must be removed. 
Still other instruments do not have calibrated gains or 
attenuators. They require external attenuators. 
16. Scanning 
16.1 Grid Pattern - The surface of the casting shall 
be laid out in a 12 by 12 in. [300 by 300 mm] or any

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirement shall be applied only when agreed upon between 
the purchaser and the supplier to achieve an effective examination of a critical casting area 
that cannot be effectively examined using a longitudinal beam as a result of casting design 
or possible discontinuity orientation. 
S1. Angle Beam Examination of Steel Castings 
S1.1 Equipment: 
S1.1.1 Examination Instrument- Examination shall 
be conducted with an ultrasonic, pulsed-reflection type of 
system generating frequencies of at least 0.4 to 5 MHz. 
Properties of the electronic apparatus shall be the same as 
those specified in 4.1. 
S1.1.2 Search Units - Angle-beam search units 
shall produce an angle beam ip. steel in the range from 30 
to 75° inclusive, measured to the perpendicular of the entry 
surface of the casting being examined. It is preferred that 
search units shall have frequency of 0.4 to 5 MHz. 
S1.1.3 Calibration Blocks - A set of blocks, as 
shown in Fig. 4, with as cast surface equivalent to SCRATA 
Comparator A3 and of a thickness comparable to the sec­
tions being examined with side-drilled holes at ¼t, ½t, and 
¾t (where t = thickness of the block) shall be used to 
establish an amplitude reference line (ARL). 
Sl.2 Calibration of Equipment: 
S1.2.1 Construct the distance amplitude correction 
curve by utilizing the responses from the side-drilled holes 
in the basic calibration block for angle beam examination 
as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 5. 
S1.2.1.1 Resolve and mark the amplitudes of the 
¼t and ½t side-drilled holes from the same surface. The 
side-drilled hole used for the ¼t amplitude may be used 
to establish the ¾t amplitude from the opposite surface or 
a separate hole may be used. 
S1.2.1.2 Connect the ¼t, ½t, and ¾t amplitudes to 
establish the applicable DAC. 
S1.2.2 The basic calibration blocks shall be made 
of material that is acoustically similar to the casting being 
examined. 
S1.2.3 Do not use basic calibration blocks with as 
cast surface equivalent to SCRA TA Comparator A3 to 
examine castings with surface rougher than SCRATA 
Comparator A3. Use a machined calibration block for 
machined surfaces. 
S1.2.4 The search unit and all instrument control 
settings remain unchanged except the attenuator or cali­
brated gain control. 
S1.2.4.1 The attenuator or calibrated gain control 
may be used to change the signal amplitude during exami­
nation to permit small amplitude signals to be more readily 
detected. Signal evaluation is made by returning the attenu­
ator or calibrated gain control to its original setting. 
S1.3 Data Reporting - The supplier's report of final 
ultrasonic examination shall contain the following data: 
S1.3.1 The total number, location, amplitude, and 
area of all indications equal to or greater than 100% of the 
distance amplitude curve. 
S1.3.2 The examination frequency, type of instru­
ment, type, and size of search units employed, couplant, 
transfer method, examination operator, supplier's identi­
fying numbers, purchase order number, date, and author­
ized signature. 
S1.3.3 A sketch showing the physical outline of the 
casting, including dimensions of all areas not examined 
due to geometric configuration, with the location of all 
indications in accordance with S1.3.1. 
S1.4 Acceptance Standards - Acceptance quality lev­
els shall be established between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer on the basis of one or more of the following 
criteria: 
S1.4.1 No indication equal to or greater than the 
DAC over an area specified for the applicable quality level 
of Table 2. 
S1.4.2 Other criteria agreed upon between the pur­
chaser and the manufacturer.

INTERNATIONAi. 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Carbon Steel, High Strength, for 
Moderate and Lower Temperature Service 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designationA612/A612M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers killed carbon-manganese­
silicon steel plates intended for welded pressure vessels in 
service at moderate and lower temperatures. 
1.2 The maximum thiclrness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the material to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.3 For plates produced from coil and furnished without 
heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the additional 
requirements, including additional testing requirements and the 
reporting of additional test results, of Specification A20/ A20M 
apply. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical

1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers hot-finished or cold-fin­
ished precipitation hardening iron base superalloy bars, 
forgings, and forging stock for high-temperature service. 
The mechanical properties of these alloys are developed 
by suitable solution treating and precipitation hardening 
treatments. 
1.2 Two grades of iron base alloy are covered. Selection 
will depend upon design, service conditions, mechanical 
properties, and elevated temperature characteristics. 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
(metric) units are to be regarded separately as standards; 
within the text and tables, the SI units are shown in [brack­
ets]. The values stated in each system are not exact equiva­
lents; therefore, each system must be used independent of 
the other. Combining values from the two systems may 
result in nonconformance with the specification. 
1.4 Unless the order specifies an "M" designation, the 
material shall be furnished to inch-pound units.

SA-645/SA-645M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, 5 % and 5½ % Nickel Alloy Steels, 
Specially Heat Treated 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers specially heat treated 5 % and 
5 ½ % nickel alloy steel plates intended primarily for welded 
pressure vessels for service at low or cryogenic temperatures. 
1.2 The maximum thickness of plates which can be supplied 
under this specification is limited only by the capacity of the 
material to meet the specified requirements. 
1.3 This material is susceptible to magnetization. Use of 
magnets in handling after heat treatment should be avoided if 
residual magnetism would be detrimental to subsequent fabri­
cation or service. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.5 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica­
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.
