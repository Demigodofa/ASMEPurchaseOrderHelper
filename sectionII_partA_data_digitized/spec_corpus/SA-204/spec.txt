SA-204/SA-204M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Molybdenum 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers molybdenum-alloy steel 
plates, intended particularly for welded boilers and other 
pressure vessels. 
1.2 Plates under this specification are available in three 
grades having different strength levels as follows: 
Grade Tensile Strength, ksi [MPa] 
A 65-85 [450-585] 
B 70-90 [485-620] 
C 75-95 [515-655] 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with this specifi­
cation. 
l .5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
• 3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/ A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.3 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates 
produced from coil means plates that have been cut to 
individual lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or 
is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of 
coils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, 
leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, 
heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for 
shipment, and certification. 
Norn 1-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat 
treatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are reported for 
each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plates from coil 
are described in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed.

to the requirements of Specification A1016/A1016M, includ-
ing any supplementary requirements that are indicated in the 
purchase order. Failure to comply with the general require­
ments of Specification A1016/Al016M constitutes nonconfor­
mance with this specification. In case of conflict with the 
requirements of this specification and Specification Al016/ 
Al016M, this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice--The steel shall be killed. 
4.2 The tubes shall be made by the seamless process and 
shall be either hot-finished or cold-finished, as specified. 
4.3 Heat Treatment-Hot-finished tubes shall be heat treated 
at a temperature of 1200 °F [650 °C] or higher. Cold-finished 
tubes shall, after the final cold finishing, be heat treated at a 
temperature of 1200 °F [650 °C] or higher, or tubing may be 
furnished in the full-annealed, isothermal annealed, or nonnal­
ized and tempered condition. If furnished in the normalized 
and tempered condition, the minimum tempering temperature 
shall be 1200 °F [ 650 °C]. 
5. Chemical Composition

which are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment 
is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the same 
size and from the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, the 
number of tubes of the same size and from the same heat in a lot shall be 
determined from the size of the tubes as prescribed in Table 2. 
NoTE 3-For tensile and hardness test requirements, the term "lot" 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall 
thickness which are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
the same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, a lot shall 
include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the same furnace 
at the same temperature, time at heat, and furnace speed. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in Table 3. 
10.2 Table 4 gives the computed minimum elongation 
values for each 1/32-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. 
Where the wall thickness lies between two values shown 
above, the minimum elongation value shall be determined by 
the following equation: 
E = 48t+ 15.00 [ E = l.87t+ 15.00] 
where: 
E elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm, %, and 
= actual thiclmess of specimen, in. [mm]. 
11. Hardness Requirements 
11.1 The tubes shall have a hardness not exceeding the 
following: 79 HRBW or 143 HBW for Grade A-1, 89 HRBW 
or 179 HBW for Grade C. 
12. Mechanical Tests Required 
12.1 Tension Test-One tension test shall be made on a 
specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall 
be made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes (see Note 3). 
12.2 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of one finished tube from each lot 
(see Note 2), but not the one used for the flaring test. Tears or 
breaks occurring at the 12 or 6 o'clock positions on Grade C 
tubing with sizes of 2.375 in. [60.3 mm] in outside diameter 
and smaller shall not be considered a basis for rejection. 
12.3 Flaring Test-One flaring test shall be made on speci­
mens from each end of the one finished tube from each lot (see 
Note 2), but not the one used for the flattening test. 
12.4 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot (see 
Note 3).

INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless Ferritic and Austenitic Alloy-Steel Boiler, 
Superheater, and Heat-Exchanger Tubes 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A213/A213M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1. 1 This specification 2 covers seamless ferritic and auste­
nitic steel boiler, superheater, and heat-exchanger tubes, des­
ignated Grades TS, TP304, etc. These steels are listed in Tables 
1 and 2. 
1.2 Grades containing the letter, H, in their designation, 
have requirements different from those of similar grades not 
containing the letter, H. These different requirements provide 
higher creep-rupture strength than normally achievable in 
similar grades without these different requirements. 
1.3 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter to 5 in. 
[127 mm] in outside diameter and 0.015 to 0.500 in. [0.4 to 
12.7 mm], inclusive, in minimum wall thickness or, if specified 
in the order, average wall thickness. Tubing having other 
diameters may be furnished, provided such tubes comply with 
all other requirements of this specification. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
l.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

EAccelerated air cooling or liquid quenching shall be permitted for Class 2. 
F Quenched in water or rapidly cooled by other means, at a rate sufficient to prevent re-precipitation of carbides, as demonstrable by the capability of tubes, heat treated 
by either separate solution annealing or by direct quenching, passing Practices A262, Practice E. The manufacturer is not required to run the test unless it is specified on 
the purchase order (see Supplementary Requirement S4). Note that Practices A262 requires the test to be performed on sensitized specimens in the low-carbon and 
stabilized types and on specimens representative of the as-shipped condition for other types. In the case of low-carbon types containing 3 % or more molybdenum, the 
applicability of the sensitizing treatment prior to testing shall be a matter for negotiation between the seller and the purchaser. 
0 A maximum solution treating temperature of 2100 °F [1150 °CJ is recommended for UNS S21500. 
HA solution treating temperature above 1950 °F [1065 °CJ may impair resistance to intergranular corrosion after subsequent exposure to sensitizing conditions in the 
indicated grades. When specified by the purchaser, a lower temperature stabilization or resolution anneal shall be used subsequent to the higher-temperature solution 
anneal prescribed in this table. 
1 Solution treatment shall be preceded by a softening heat treatment prior to cold-working. The softening temperature shall be at least 90 °F [50 °C] higher than the solution 
heat treatment temperature, which shall be at 2150 °F [1180 °C] minimum. 
4.1.7 Size (outside diameter and minimum wall thickness, 
unless average wall thickness is specified), 
4.1.8 Length (specific or random),

10.1), 
4.1.10 Specification designation and year of issue, 
4.1.11 Increased sulfur (for machinability, see Note B, Table 
1, and 16.3), and 
4.1.12 Special requirements and any supplementary require­
ments selected. 
5. General Requirements 
5 .1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification Al016/A1016M, including 
any supplementary requirements that are indicated in the 
purchase order. Failure to comply with the general require­
ments of Specification Al016/A1016M constitutes nonconfor­
mance with this specification. In case of conflict between the 
requirements of this specification and Specification A1016/ 
Al016M, this specification shall prevail. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 Manufacture and Condition-Tubes shall be made by 
the seamless process and shall be either hot finished or cold 
finished, as specified. Grade TP34 7HFG shall be cold finished. 
6.2 Heat Treatment: 
286 
6.2.l Ferritic Alloy and Ferritic Stainless Steels-The fer­
ritic alloy and ferritic stainless steels shall be reheated for heat 
treatment in accordance with the requirements of Table 3. Heat 
treatment shall be carried out separately and in addition to 
heating for hot forming. 
6.2.2 Austenitic Stainless Steels-AU austenitic tubes shall 
be furnished in the heat-treated condition, and shall be heat 
treated in accordance with the requirements of Table 3. 
Alternatively, immediately after hot forming, while the tem­
perature of the tubes is not less than the minimum solution or 
stabilization treatment temperature specified in Table 3, tubes 
may be individually quenched in water or rapidly cooled by 
other means (direct quenched). 
6.3 If any controlled structural characteristics are required, 
these shall be so specified in the order as to be a guide as to the 
most suitable heat treatment. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 Composition Requirements: 
7 .1.1 The alloy steels shall conform to the chemical require­
ments given in Table 1. 
7.1.2 The stainless steels shall conform to the chemical 
requirements given in Table 2. 
7.2 Product Analysis:

=== Page 339 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-213/SA-213M (ASTM A213/A213M) 
7 .2.1 An analysis of either one billet or one tube shall be 
made from each heat. The chemical composition thus deter­
mined shall conform to the requirements specified. 
7.2.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional billets or tubes shall be made. Both retests, for 
the elements in question, shall meet the requirements of the 
specification; otherwise all remaining material in the heat shall 
be rejected or, at the option of the producer, each billet or tube 
may be individually tested for acceptance. Billets or tubes that 
do not meet the requirements of the specification shall be 
rejected. 
8. Grain Size 
8.1 Grain size shall be as given in Table 3, as determined in 
accordance with Test Methods E112. 
8.2 Grain size determinations, to demonstrate compliance 
with 8.1, shall be made on one end of one finished tube from 
each lot. See 15.1. 
9. Mechanical Properties 
9.1 Tensile Requirements: 
9.1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties given in Table 4. 
9.1.2 Table 5 gives the computed minimum elongation 
values for each V32-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. 
Where the wall thickness lies between two values shown in 
Table 5, the minimum elongation value shall be determined by 
the following equations. For Grades T23, T24, T91, T92, T115, 
T122, Tl28, T911, T921, and S44400: E = 32t + 10.00 [E = 
1.25t + 10.00]. For Grade T36: E = 32t + 5.0 [E = 1.25t + 5.0]. 
For grade T93: E = 32t + 9.00 [E = l.25t + 9.00]. For all other 
ferritic alloy grades: E = 48t + 15.00 [E = l.87t + 15.00]. 
where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. [50 mm], %, and 
t = actual thickness of specimen, in. [mm]. 
9 .1.3 One tension test shall be made on a specimen from one 
tube for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall be 
made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes. See 15.2. 
9.2 Hardness Requirements: 
9 .2.1 The material shall conform to the hardness require­
ments given in Table 4. See 15.2. 
9.2.2 Brinell, Vickers, or Rockwell hardness tests shall be 
made on specimens from two tubes from each lot. See 15.2. 
9 .3 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used 
for the flaring test, from each lot. See 15.1. 
9.4 Flaring Test-One flaring test shall be made on speci­
mens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used for 
the flattening test, from each lot. See 15.1. 
9.5 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than Vs in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 
thinner than 0.015 in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
10. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
10.1 Each tube shall be subjected to the nondestructive 
electric test or the hydrostatic test. The type of test to be used 
shall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order. 
11. Forming Operations 
11.1 Tubes, when inserted in a boiler or tube sheet, shall 
stand expanding and beading without showing cracks or flaws. 
Superheater tubes when properly manipulated shall stand all 
forging, welding, and bending operations necessary for appli­
cation without developing defects. See Note 1. 
NOTE I-Certain of the ferritic steels covered by this specification will 
harden if cooled rapidly from above their critical temperature. Some will 
air harden, that is, become hardened to an undesirable degree when cooled 
in air from high temperatures, particularly chromium-containing steels 
with chromium of 4 % and higher. Therefore, operations that involve 
heating such steels above their critical temperatures, such as welding, 
flanging, and hot bending, should be followed by suitable heat treatment. 
12. Repair by Welding 
12.1 Repair welding shall be performed in conformance . 
with Specification A1016/A1016M. 
12.2 All repair welds in T91 shall be made with one of the 
following welding processes and consumables: SMAW, A5.5/ 
A5.5M E90XX-B9; SAW, A5.23/A5.23M EB9 + neutral flux; 
GTAW, A5.28/A5.28M ER90S-B9; and FCAW A5.29/A5.29M 
E91Tl-B9. In addition, the sum of the Ni+Mn content of all 
welding consumables used to weld repair T91 Types 1 and 2 
shall not exceed 1.0 %. 
12.3 All repair welds in T92, T93, T911, and T122, shall be 
made using welding consumables meeting the chemical re­
quirements for the grade in Table 1. 
13. Permissible Variations from the Specified Wall 
Thickness 
13.1 Permissible variations from the specified minimum 
wall thickness shall be in accordance with Specification 
A1016/A1016M. 
13.2 Permissible variations from the specified average wall 
thickness shall be ± 10 % of the specified average wall 
thickness for cold formed tubes and, unless otherwise specified 
by the purchaser, shall be in accordance with Table 6 for hot 
formed tubes. 
287 
14. Surface Condition 
14.1 Ferritic alloy cold-finished steel tubes shall be free of 
scale and suitable for inspection. A slight amount of oxidation 
is not considered scale. 
14.2 Ferritic alloy hot-finished steel tubes shall be free of 
loose scale and suitable. for inspection. • 
14.3 Stainless steel tubes shall be pickled free of scale. 
When bright annealing is used, pickling is not necessary. 
14.4 Any special finish requirement shall be subject to 
agreement between the supplier and the purchaser. 
15. Sampling 
15.1 For flattening, flaring, and grain size·requirements, the 
term lot applies to all tubes, prior to cutting, of the same size· 
(see 4.1.7) that are produced from the same heat of steel.When

a stabilization heat treatment at a temperature lower than that 
used for the initial solution annealing heat treatment. The 
temperature of stabilization heat treatment shall be at a 
temperature as agreed upon between the purchaser and vendor. 
S3. Unstraightened Tubes 
S3 .1 When the purchaser specifies tubes unstraightened 
after final heat treatment (such as coils), the minimum yield 
strength of Table 4 shall be reduced by 5 ksi [35 MPa]. 
S3.2 On the certification, and wherever the grade designa­
tion for unstraightened tubing appears, it shall be identified 
with the suffix letter "U" (for example, 304-U, 321-U, etc.). 
S4. lntergranular Corrosion Test 
S4.1 When specified, material shall pass intergranular cor­
rosion tests conducted by the manufacturer in accordance with 
Practices A262, Practice E. 
Norn S4.1-Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condition for 
low carbon or stabilized grades, and on the as-shipped condition for other 
grades. 
S4.2 A stabilization heat treatment in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement S2 may be necessary and is 
permitted in order to meet this requirement for the grades 
containing titanium or columbium, particularly in their H 
versions. 
SS. Minimum Cooling Rate for Grade T91 Type 2 
S5.l For Grade T91 Type 2 material, the heat treatment 
shall ensure that following austenitizing the rate of cooling 
from 1650 °F to 900 °F [900 °C to 480 °C] is no slower than 
9 °F/min [5 °C/ min].

Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Carbon Steel Heat-Exchanger 
and Condenser Tubes 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
electric-resistance-welded, carbon steel tubes to be used for 
heat exchangers, condensers, and similar heat-transfer appara­
tus. 
1.2 The tubing sizes usually furnished to this specification 
are to 3 in. [76.2 mm] in outside diameter, inclusive. Tubing 
having other dimensions may be furnished, provided such 
tubes comply with all other requirements of this specification. 
1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.4 The purchaser shall specify in the order the outside 
diameter and minimum wall thickness. The inside diameter 
shall not be specified. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Deparnnent of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers carbon steel castings for 
valves, flanges, fittings, or other pressure-containing parts for 
high-temperature service and of quality suitable for assembly 
with other castings or wrought steel parts by fusion welding. 
1.2 Three grades, WCA, WCB, and WCC, are covered in 
this specification. Selection will depend upon design and 
service conditions, mechanical properties, and the high­
temperature characteristics. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the standard.

of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon ( e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.

1. Scope* 
L 1 This specification 2 covers martensitic stainless steel and 
alloy steel castings for valves, flanges, fittings, and other 
pressure-containing parts (Note 1) intended primarily for 
high-temperature and corrosive service (Note 2). 
1.2 One grade of martensitic stainless steel and nine grades 
of ferritic alloy steel are covered. Selection will depend on 
design and service conditions, mechanical properties, and the 
high-temperature and corrosion-resistant characteristics (Note 
3). 
NoTB I-Carbon steel castings for pressure-containing parts are cov­
ered by Specification A216/A216M. Low alloy quench-and-tempered 
grades equivalent to Specification A217/A217M grades may be found in 
both Specifications A352/A352M and A487/A487M. 
NoTB 2-The grades covered by this specification represent materials 
that are generally suitable for assembly with other castings or wrought 
steel parts by fusion welding. It is not intended to imply that these grades 
possess equal degrees of weldability; therefore, it is the responsibility of 
the purchaser to establish for himself a suitable welding technique. Since 
these grades possess varying degrees of suitability for high-temperature 
and corrosion-resistant service, it is also the responsibility of the purchaser 
to determine which grade shall be furnished, due consideration being 
given to the requirements of the applicable construction codes. 
NoTB 3-The committee formulating this specification has included 
nine grades of materials that are considered to represent basic types of 
ferritic alloy steels suitable for valves, flanges, fittings, and other pressure­
containing parts. Additional alloy steels that may better fulfill certain types 
of service will he considered for inclusion in this specification by the 
committee as the need becomes apparent. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each

Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Manganese-Vanadium­
Nickel 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers manganese-vanadium-nickel 
alloy steel plates intended primarily for welded layered pres­
sure vessels. 
1.2 Plates under this specification are available in two 
grades having different strength levels as follows: 
Grade 
C 
D 
Tensile Strength, ksi [MPa] 
1 05-135 [725-930] 
3 in. [75 mm] and under 80-105 [550-725] 
Over 3 in. [75 mm] 75-100 [515-690] 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the chemical composition to meet the specified 
mechanical property requirements. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be. regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. 
2. Referenced Documents 
2.1 ASTM Standards: 
A20/ A20M Specification for General Requirements for Steel 
Plates for Pressure Vessels 
A435/A435M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic 
Examination of Steel Plates

amination of Steel Plates 
A578/A578M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic 
Examination of Rolled Steel Plates for Special Applica­
tions 
3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
312 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is refe1Ted to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.3 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates 
produced from coil means plates that have been cut to 
individual lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or 
is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of 
coils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, 
leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, 
heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for 
shipment, and certification. 
Norn 1-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat 
treatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are reported for 
each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plates from coil 
are described in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail.
