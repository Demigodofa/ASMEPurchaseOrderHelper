SPECIFICATION FOR FERRITIC MALLEABLE IRON 
CASTINGS 
SA-47 /SA-47M 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A47/A 47M-99(2018)'1, except for the deletion of welded repair references in 11.2 and 11.3, and mandatory 
certification in 14.1.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers ferritic malleable castings 
for general engineering usage at temperatures from normal 
ambient to approximately 400°C (750°F). 
1.2 No precise quantitative relationship can be stated 
between the properties of the iron in various locations of 
the same casting and those of a test specimen cast from 
the same iron (see Appendix Xl). 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconfonnance 
with the specification.

to iron are found in Terminology A 644. 
4. Classification 
4.1 Castings ordered and produced under this specifi­
cation are classified under the following grades based on 
tests on separately cast test bars. Separately cast test bars 
shall be poured from the same lot of iron as the castings 
they represent and shall be heat treated with those castings 
except as provided in 7.2.3. 
4.1.1 Grade 32510 [Grade 22010]:

tion indicate the minimum yield strength (X 100 psi [MPa]) 
and the last two digits indicate the minimum elongation 
(% in 2 in. [50 mm]). 
5. Ordering Information 
5.1 The purchase order for castings ordered under this 
specification shall state the specification designation, the 
year in which the specification was issued, and the grade 
of malleable iron to be supplied. Any option or special 
additions to the basic requirements of this specification 
shall be clearly and fully stipulated. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The chemical composition of the iron shall be such 
as to produce the structural and mechanical properties 
required by this specification. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Factors influencing the properties of castings and 
their relationship to those of test specimens and separate 
test castings are discussed in Appendix Xl.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-47 /SA-47M 
7.2 Tension Test Specimens: 
7 .2.1 The tension test specimens shall be cast to the 
form and dimensions shown in Fig. 1 or Fig. 2, in the same 
kind of molding material used for the production castings. 
At least three such specimens shall be cast from a represen­
tative ladle of iron either from each batch-melted heat or, 
in continuous melting, from each 4 h pour period during 
which the purchaser's castings were poured, or as otherwise 
agreed upon between manufacturer and purchaser. 
7.2.2 All test specimens shall be suitably identified 
with the designation of either the batch-melted heat or the 
pour period of a continuous heat. 
7 .2.3 All test specimens shall be heat treated in the 
same production furnaces and in the same cycles as the 
castings they represent. However, in those instances 
wherein the critical sections of the production castings 
differ appreciably from that of the central portion of the 
test specimens, the time cycle for tempering the test speci­
mens may be altered from that of the production lot in 
order to obtain similar microstructures or hardness, or both, 
in both specimen and castings. In such cases the hardness 
of the specimens shall be tested and reported along with 
the tensile test results. 
7.2.4 The tension test is usually performed on unma­
chined specimens. However, for referee work, the speci­
men may be machined from the standard cast bar to the 
dimensions shown in Fig. 3. 
7.3 Tension Test Method: 
7.3.1 The gage length of the standard tension speci­
men shall be 2.00 ± 0.ol in. [50.0 ± 0.3 mm]. 
7 .3.2 The diameter used to compute the cross-sec­
tional area shall be the average between the largest and 
smallest diameters in that section of the 2 in. [50 mm] 
gage length having the smallest diameter and shall be mea­
sured to the nearest 0.001 in. [0.2 mm]. No cast bar having 
a mean diameter less than 0.590 in. [15.0 mm] shall be 
accepted for test. 
7.3.3 After reaching a stress equivalent to approxi­
mately half of the anticipated yield stress, the speed of the 
moving head of the testing machine shall not exceed 
0.50 in./min [12.5 mm/min] through the breaking load. 
7.3.4 While the values for yield point and yield 
strength are not identical, they are sufficiently close for 
most applications of ferritic malleable irons to be used 
interchangeably. They may be determined by any of the 
approved techniques described in the paragraphs on Deter­
mination of Yield Strength and Yield Point of Test Methods 
E 8. If determined as yield strength, that stress producing 
an extension under load of 0.01 in. [0.25 mm] over the 
2 in. [50 mm] gage length (for example, 0.5% extension) 
or an offset of 0.2% shall be taken as the yield stress, 
which shall be converted to yield strength by dividing by 
the original cross-sectional area of the gage length found 
in accordance with 7.3.2. It shall be reported to the nearest 
100 psi [MPa]. In referee work, yield strength shall be 
determined as the stress that produces an extension under 
load of 0.5% of the gage length. 
7 .3.5 The tensile strength shall be the maximum load 
carried by the specimen during the test divided by the 
original cross-sectional area of the gage length, as found 
in accordance with 7.3.2. It shall be reported to the nearest 
100 psi [MPa]. 
7 .3.6 The elongation is the increase in gage length 
after fracture of a tensile specimen, measured to the nearest 
0.01 in. [0.25 mm], expressed as a percentage of the origi­
nal gage length. It shall be reported to the nearest 0.5%. 
7.4 Retesting: 
7.4.1 If, after testing, a specimen shows evidence of 
a defect, another tension test may be made on a companion 
specimen. Also, a retest shall be permitted whenever frac­
ture occurs outside the central 50% of the gage length. 
7 .4.2 If the results of a valid test fail to conform to 
the requirements of this specification, two retests shall be 
made. If either retest fails to meet the specification, the 
castings represented by these test specimens shall be 
rejected. A valid test is one wherein the test specimen has 
been properly prepared and appears to be sound and on 
which the approved test procedure has been followed. 
131 
7.4.3 If sufficient companion test bars are unavail­
able, the manufacturer shall have the option of testing a 
specimen cut from a representative casting. Therefore, as 
stated in Xl.3, the mechanical properties of such tension 
test specimen removed from a production casting will not 
necessarily correspond to those of a standard separately 
cast test specimen, the values in Table 1 do not apply. 
Instead, the mechanical properties of the test specimen 
from the casting must equal or exceed the average of those 
from similar test specimens removed from the same loca­
tion from two castings of the same design where separately 
cast test bars meet the requirements of Table 1. 
7 .4.4 If the first test results indicate that a reheat 
treatment is needed to meet the test requirements, the entire 
lot of castings and the representative test specimens shall 
be reheat treated together. Testing shall then be repeated 
in accordance with 7.4.1-7.4.3. 
7 .4.5 The results of all tests, including retests, shall 
be posted in permanent record, which shall state any abnor­
malities observed during the test and in the fractured ends. 
Such records shall be kept for at least 1 year after shipment 
of the production castings and shall be available for exami­
nation by the purchaser or by his authorized representative. 
7 .4.6 If not covered in the purchase agreement, the 
frequency of tension testing shall be in accordance with 
7.2.1 and sufficiently often to ensure uniformity of product 
and compliance with minimum test requirements.

=== Page 184 ===

SA-47 /SA-47M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
7.4.7 Tension test results, obtained in accordance 
with the above subsections, must conform to the values of 
Table 1 for acceptance under this specification except as 
provided in 7.4.3. 
7 .4.8 When agreed upon between manufacturer and 
purchaser, tested specimens or unbroken test bars shall be 
preserved by the manufacturer for a period of three months 
after the date of the test report. 
1.5 Hardness Test- If the purchase agreement requires 
hardness testing, the acceptable hardness range shall be 
stated and a test location clearly shown on the covering 
drawing(s). 
7.5.1 Hardness Test Method - The Brinell method 
of hardness testing in accordance with Test Method E 10 
shall be employed whenever possible. 
7.5.2 For castings of such size or shape that do not 
permit Brinell testing with the standard 3000-kgf load, the 
500 kgf may be employed, the hardness number being 
reported as HB 10/500/15. In very unusual cases where it 
is impossible to use the Brinell method, the Rockwell 
test may be substituted, using Test Methods E 18 with 
an appropriate Rockwell scale. Conversions of hardness 
values from one method to another according to Standard 
E 140, which does not specifically cover cast irons, are 
approximate only and, therefore, are generally inadvisable. 
7.5.3 Sufficient material shall be removed from the 
cast surface to ensure that the measured surface is represen­
tative. 
7 .5.4 Sampling procedures and the frequency of 
hardness testing shall be fully detailed on the purchase 
agreement. Otherwise, hardness tests shall be performed 
at the discretion of the producer. 
7 .5.5 Castings failing to conform to the required 
hardness range may be reheat treated and retested. If after 
reheat treating they still fail the hardness requirements, 
they shall be rejected. 
7.5.6 Typical hardness maximums for this grade of 
malleable iron are listed in Table 2. 
8. Microstructure Requirements 
8.1 The microstructure of the malleable iron shall con­
sist of temper carbon nodules distributed through a ferritic 
matrix and shall be free of excessive pearlite, massive 
carbides, and primary. graphite. 
8.2 When agreed upon by the purchaser and producer, 
the maximum decarburization at any as-cast surface after 
heat treatment may be stipulated in writing, as measured 
by visual depletion of combined carbon after polishing, 
etching in nital, and viewing at lOOX. 
132 
8.3 In reference work, the metallographic practice rec­
ommended in Test Method A 247 shall be followed. 
9. Soundness Requirements 
9.1 All castings, on visual examination, shall be sound 
and free of obvious shrinkage and porosity. 
9.2 If the purchaser requires soundness tests to be per­
formed, it shall be so stated in the purchase agreement, and 
the method and soundness requirements shall be detailed. 
10. Dimensional Requirements 
10.1 The castings shall conform to the dimensions 
given on drawings furnished by the purchaser, or to the 
dimensions established by the pattern equipment supplied 
by the purchaser, or as agreed upon in specific cases to 
gages supplied by the purchaser. Variations in any solid 
dimensions will be permitted, as shown in Table 3, unless 
otherwise agreed upon by the foundry and purchaser. 
11. Workmanship, Finish and Appearance 
11.1 The surface of the casting shall be inspected visu­
ally, particularly in critical areas, for such surface defects 
as cracks, hot tears, adhering sand and scale, cold shuts, 
and gas holes. 
11.2 No repairing or plugging of any kind shall be 
permitted unless written permission is granted by the pur­
chaser. Welding or brazing is not permitted under any 
circumstances. 
11.3 DELETED 
12. Responsibility for Inspection 
12.1 Unless otherwise specified in the contract or pur­
chase order, the manufacturer shall be responsible for car­
rying out all the tests and inspections required by this 
specification, using his own or other reliable facilities, and 
he shall maintain complete records of all such tests and 
inspections. Such records shall be available for review by 
the purchaser. 
12.2 The purchaser reserves the right to perform any 
inspection set forth in the specification where such inspec­
tions are deemed necessary to ensure that supplies and 
services conform to the prescribed requirements. 
13. Rejection and Rehearing 
13.1 Any casting or lot of castings failing to comply 
with the requirements of this specification may, where 
possible, be reprocessed, retested, and reinspected. If the

=== Page 185 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-47 /SA-47M 
tests and inspections on the reprocessed casting(s) show 
compliance with this specification, the castings shall be 
acceptable; if they do not, they shall be rejected. 
13.2 If the purchaser should find that a casting or lot . 
of castings fails to comply with this specification subse­
quent to receipt at his facility, he shall so notify the manu­
facturer promptly and in no case later than six weeks after 
receipt of the shipment, stating clearly his basis for rejec­
tion. In case of dissatisfaction with the purchaser's claim, 
the manufacturer may apply for a hearing before final 
rejection of the shipment. 
14. Certification 
14.1 A manufacturer's certification or compliance 
statement that the casting or lot of castings was made, 
sampled, tested, and inspected in accordance with this spec­
ification, including a report of test results signed by an 
authorized agent of the manufacturer, shall be furnished at 
the time of shipment, and such certification or compliance 
statement shall be the basis for acceptance of the casting 
or lot of castings.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
Sl. Special Conditions 
Sl.1 If agreed upon in writing by the foundry and 
purchaser, the malleable iron castings may be required to 
meet special conditions, hardness or other property dimen­
sions, surface quality, or a combination of conditions. 
S2. Test Lugs 
S2.1 If requested in writing or if included on the pat­
tern(s) or pattern drawing(s), test lugs may be cast on all 
castings of sufficient size to permit their incorporation. 
The size of such lugs shall be proportional to the thickness 
of the casting. On castings over 24 in. [600 mm] in length, 
a test lug shall be cast near each end such as not to interfere 
with any subsequent processing of the castings. The pur­
chase order shall stipulate whether the foundry's inspector 
or the purchaser's inspector shall break, inspect, and pass 
judgment on the fracture quality of these test lugs. 
S3. Destructive Tests 
S3.1 At the option of the purchaser or his representa­
tive, a casting of each design ordered may be tested to 
destruction, or otherwise broken up, to determine the pres­
ence of any manufacturing condition that might be detri­
mental to the serviceability of the casting. 
136 
S4. Special Tension Specimens 
S4.1 If tension specimens are to be machined from 
castings, their location in the casting, the specimen dimen­
sions, and the required properties shall be agreed upon in 
writing by the foundry and purchaser. 
SS. Zinc-Coated Castings 
SS.1 When specified in the contract or purchase order, 
castings shall be zinc-coated by the hot-dip process in 
accordance with Specification A 153. Castings shall be of 
a composition that will preclude the possibility of galvaniz­
ing embrittlement, or shall be either cooled from the anneal 
or subsequently heat treated so as to be immunized against 
such embrittlement. If regalvanizing is required, proce­
dures for regalvanizing castings and determining the effect 
on the casting performance must be agreed upon between 
the purchaser and the seller. 
S6. Marking of Casting for Government 
Procurement 
S6.1 When castings are specified for government pro­
curement, the location of the permanent markings specified 
in 15.1, as well as any special marking for mechanical or 
physical properties (either permanent or temporary), shall 
be as indicated on the government drawings or sketches.

APPENDIX 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF 
CASTINGS 
Xl.1 The mechanical properties of malleable iron cast­
ings are influenced by a number of factors, including the 
cooling rate during solidification, chemical composition, 
the heat treatment, the design of the casting, section thick­
ness, and the location and effectiveness of gates, risers, 
and chills. 
Xl.2 Because of the complexity of these factors in 
influencing the properties of the final product, no precise 
quantitative relationship can be stated between the proper­
ties of the iron in various locations of the same casting or 
between the properties of a casting and those of a test 
specimen cast from the same iron. When such a relationship 
is important and must be known for a specific application, 
it may be determined by appropriate experimentation. 
Xl.3 The specimen specified in 7 .2.1 as the. standard 
tensile test bar for malleable iron has a ¾ in. [16 mm] 
diameter test section that reasonably represents a typical 
section of the general run of malleable iron castings. Fur­
thermore, the initial freezing of malleable irons as homoge­
neous white iron, together with the heat treatment that is 
inherent in the manufacture of malleable iron, tends to 
reduce the section-sensitivity effect. Therefore, where 
experimentation into precise properties within a given cast­
ing would be infeasible, this standard test bar, made like 
any typical casting, should provide a practical approxima­
tion of the properties that can be expected in average sound 
malleable iron casting. 
Xl.4 If malleable iron castings are welded, the micro­
structure of the iron is markedly affected, particularly in 
the heat-affected zone. Therefore, since this may adversely 
affect the properties of the casting, the welding of malleable 
iron castings should be done under strict metallurgical 
control, followed by appropriate post-weld heat treatment, 
to minimize the substantial reductions in ductility, impact 
resistance, and machinability that could result, particularly 
in the vicinity of the weldment. Nevertheless, it is generally 
considered inadvisable to join castings to similar castings 
or to other materials, by fusion welding out in the field, 
or in manufactured assemblies, without fully testing the 
entire completed part.

SA-53/SA-53M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Pipe, Steel, Black and Hot-Dipped, Zinc-Coated, Welded and 
Seamless 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers seamless and welded black 
and hot-dipped galvanized steel pipe in NPS 1/s to NPS 26 [DN 
6 to DN 650] (Note 1), inclusive, with nominal wall thickness 
(Note 2) as given in Table X2.2 and Table X2.3. It shall be 
permissible to furnish pipe having other dimensions provided 
that such pipe complies with all other requirements of this 
specification. Supplementary requirements of an optional na­
ture are provided and shall apply only when specified by the 
purchaser. 
NoTE 1-The dimensionless designators NPS (nominal pipe size) [DN 
(diameter nominal)] have been substituted in this specification for such 
traditional terms as "nominal diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
NoTE 2--The term nominal wall thickness has been assigned for the 
purpose of convenient designation, existing ill name only, and is used to 
distinguish it from the actual wall thickness, which may vary over or 
under the nominal wall thickness. 
1.2 This specification covers the following types and 
grades: 
1.2.1 Type F-Fumace-butt-welded, continuous welded 
Grade A, 
1.2.2 Type &-Electric-resistance-welded, Grades A and B, 
and 
1.2.3 Type S-Seamless, Grades A and B. 
NoTE 3-See Appendix Xl for definitions of types of pipe. 
1.3 Pipe ordered under this specification is intended for 
mechanical and pressure applications and is also acceptable for 
ordinary uses in steam, water, gas, and air lines. It is suitable 
for welding, and suitable for forming operations involving 
coiling, bending, and flanging, subject to the following quali­
fications: 
1.3.1 Type Fis not intended for flanging. 
1.3.2 If Type S or Type Eis required for close coiling or 
cold bending, Grade A is the preferred grade; however, this is 
not intended to prohibit the cold bending of Grade B pipe. 
1.3.3 Type E is furnished either nonexpanded or cold 
expanded at the option of the manufacturer. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.5 The following precautionary caveat pertains only to the 
test method portion, Sections 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, and 15 of this 
specification: This standard does not purport to address all of 
the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory requirements prior to use. 
1.6 The text of this specification contains notes or footnotes, 
or both, that provide explanatory material. Such notes and 
footnotes, excluding those in tables and figures, do not contain 
any mandatory requirements. 
140 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

7.1 Tension Test: 
7 .1.1 For tension tests other than transverse weld tension 
tests, the yield strength corresponding to a permanent offset of 
0.2 % of the gage length or to an extension of 0.5 % of the gage 
length under load, the tensile strength, and the elongation in 2 
in. or 50 mm shall be determined, and the tension test results 
shall conform to the applicable tensile property requirements 
given in Table 2.

U = specified minimum tensile strength, psi [MPa]. 
8 See Table X4.1 or Table X4.2, whichever is applicable, for the minimum 
elongation values that are required for various combinations of tension test 
specimen size and specified minimum tensile strength. 
7 .2 Bend Test: 
7.2.1 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] or smaller, a sufficient length 
of pipe shall be capable of being bent cold through 90° around 
a cylindrical mandrel, the diameter of which is twelve times the 
specified outside diameter of the pipe, without developing 
cracks at any portion and without opening the weld. 
7.2.2 If ordered for close coiling, the pipe shall stand being 
bent cold through 180° around a cylindrical mandrel, the 
diameter of which is eight times the specified outside diameter 
of the pipe, without failure. 
7.2.3 Double-extra-strong pipe over NPS 1 V4 [DN 32] need 
not be subjected to the bend test. 
7 .3 Flattening Test: 
7.3.1 The flattening test shall be made on welded pipe over 
NPS 2 [DN 50] in extra-strong weight or lighter. 
7.3.2 Seamless Pipe: 
7.3.2.1 Although testing is not required, pipe shall be 
capable of meeting the flattening test requirements of Supple­
mentary Requirement S 1, if tested. 
7.3.3 Electric-Resistance-Welded Pipe: 
7.3.3.1 A test specimen at least 4 in. [100 mm] in length 
shall be flattened cold between parallel plates in three steps, 
with the weld located either 0° or 90° from the line of direction 
of force as required by 7.3.3.2 or 7.3.3.3, whichever is 
applicable. During the first step, which is a test for ductility of 
the weld, except as allowed by 7.3.5, 7.3.6, and 7.3.7, no cracks 
or breaks on the inside or outside surface at the weld shall be 
present before the distance between the plates is less than two 
thirds of the specified outside diameter of the pipe. As a second 
step, the flattening shall be continued as a test for ductility 
away from the weld. During the second step, except as allowed 
by 7.3.6 and 7.3.7, no cracks or breaks on the inside or outside 
surface away from the weld shall be present before the distance 
between the plates is less than one third of the specified outside 
diameter of the pipe but is not less than five times the specified 
wall thickness of the pipe. During the third step, which is a test 
for soundness, the flattening shall be continued until the test 
specimen breaks or the opposite walls of the test specimen 
meet. Evidence of laminated or unsound material or of incom­
plete weld that is revealed by the flattening test shall be cause 
for rejection. 
142 
7.3.3.2 For pipe produced in single lengths, the flattening 
test specified in 7.3.3.1 shall be made using a test specimen

=== Page 195 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-53/SA-53M 
taken from each end of each length of pipe. The tests from each 
end shall be made alternately with the weld at 0° and at 90° 
from the line of direction of force. 
7.3.3.3 For pipe produced in multiple lengths, the flattening 
test specified in 7.3.3.1 shall be made as follows: 
(1) Test specimens taken from, and representative of, the 
front end of the first pipe intended to be supplied from each 
coil, the back end of the last pipe intended to be supplied from 
each coil, and each side of any intermediate weld stop location 
shall be flattened with the weld located at 90° from the line of 
direction of force. 
(2) Test specimens taken from pipe at any two locations 
intermediate to the front end of the first pipe and the back end 
of the last pipe intended to be supplied from each coil shall be 
flattened with the weld located at 0° from the line of direction 
of force. 
7.3.3.4 For pipe that is to be subsequently reheated through­
out its cross section and hot formed by a reducing process, the 
manufacturer shall have the option of obtaining the flattening 
test specimens required by 7.3.3.2 or 7.3.3.3, whichever is 
applicable, either prior to or after such hot reducing. 
7.3.4 Continuous-Welded Pipe-A test specimen at least 4 
in. [100 mm] in length shall be flattened cold between parallel 
plates in three steps. The weld shall be located at 90° from the 
line of direction of force. During the first step, which is a test 
for ductility of the weld, except as allowed by 7.3.5, 7.3.6, and 
7.3.7, no cracks or breaks on the inside, outside, or end 
surfaces at the weld shall be present before the distance 
between tl1e plates is less than three fourths of the specified 
outside diameter of the pipe. As a second step, the flattening 
shall be continued as a test for ductility away from the weld. 
During the second step, except as allowed by 7.3.6 and 7.3.7, 
no cracks or breaks on the inside, outside, or end smfaces away 
from the weld shall be present before the distance between the 
plates is less than 60 % of the specified outside diameter of the 
pipe. During the third step, which is a test for soundness, the 
flattening shall be continued until the test specimen breaks or 
the opposite walls of the test specimen meet. Evidence of 
laminated or unsound material or of incomplete weld that is 
revealed by the flattening test shall be cause for rejection. 
7.3.5 Surface imperfections in the test specimen before 
flattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening 
test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements 
in Section 12. 
7.3.6 Superficial ruptures as a result of surface imperfec­
tions shall not be cause for rejection. 
7.3.7 For pipe with a D-to-t ratio less than 10, because the 
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the 
inside surface at the 6 and 12 o'clock locations, cracks at such 
locations shall not be cause for rejection. 
8. Hydrostatic Test 
8.1 The hydrostatic test shall be applied, without leakage 
through the weld seam or the pipe body. 
8.2 Plain-end pipe shall be hydrostatically tested to the 
applicable pressure given in Table X2.2, and threaded-and­
coupled pipe shall be hydrostatically tested to the applicable 
pressure given in Table X2.3. It shall be pennissible, at the 
discretion of the manufacturer, to perform the hydrostatic test 
on pipe with plain ends, with threads only, or with threads and 
couplings; and it shall also be permissible to test pipe in either 
single lengths or multiple lengths. 
NoTE 4-The hydrostatic test pressures given herein are inspection test 
pressures, are not intended as a basis for design, and do not have any direct 
relationship to working pressures. 
8.3 The minimum hydrostatic test pressure required to 
satisfy the requirements specified in 8.2 need not exceed 2500 
psi [17 200 kPa] for pipe NPS 3 [DN 80] or smaller or 2800 
psi [19 300 kPa] for pipe larger than NPS 3 [DN 80]; however, 
the manufacturer has the option of using higher test pressures. 
For all sizes of seamless pipe and electric-resistance-welded 
pipe, the hydrostatic test pressure shall be maintained for at 
least 5 s. 
9. Nondestructive Electric Test 
9.1 Type E Pipe: 
_9. l. l Except for pipe produced on a hot-stretch reducing 
111111, the weld seam of each length of electric-resistance­
welded pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] or larger shall be tested with a 
nondestructive electric test in accordance with Practices E213 
E273, E309, or E570. Each length of electric-resistance~ 
welded pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] or larger and produced on a 
hot-stretch-reducing mill shall be tested with a nondestructive 
electric test that inpsects the full volume of the pipe in 
accordance with Practices E213, E309, or E570. 
9.1.2 Ultrasonic and Electromagnetic Inspection-Any 
equipment utilizing the ultrasonic or electromagnetic principles 
and capable of continuous and uninterrupted inspection of the 
weld seam shall be used. The equipment shall be checked with 
an applicable reference standard as described in 9.1.3 at least 
once every working tum or not more than 8 h to demonstrate 
its effectiveness and the inspection procedures. The equipment 
shall be adjusted to produce well-defined indications when the 
reference standard is scanned by the inspection unit in a 
manner simulating the inspection of the product. 
9.1.3 Reference Standards-The length of the reference 
standards shall be determined by the pipe manufacturer, and 
they shall have the same specified diameter and thickness as 
the product being inspected. Reference standards shall contain 
machined notches, one on the inside surface and one on the 
outside surface, or a drilled hole, as shown in Fig. 1, at the 
option of the pipe manufacturer. The notches shall be parallel 
to the weld seam, and shall be separated by a distance sufficient 
to produce two separate and distinguishable signals. The 1 /s-in. 
[3.2-mm] hole shall be drilled through the wall and perpen­
dicular to the surface of the reference standard as shown in Fig. 
1. Care shall be taken in the preparation of the reference 
standard to ensure freedom from fins or other edge roughness, 
or distortion of the pipe. 
Norn 5-The calibration standards shown in Fig. 1 are convenient 
standards for calibration of nondestmctive testing equipment. The dimen­
sions of such standards are not to be construed as the minimum sizes of 
imperfections detectable by such equipment. 
143 
9 .1.4 Acceptance Limits-Table 3 gives the height of accep­
tance lilnit signals in percent of the height of signals produced 
by reference standards. Imperfections in the weld seam that

in Table 3 shall be considered a defect unless the pipe 
manufacturer can demonstrate that the imperfection does not 
reduce the effective wall thickness beyond 12.5 % of the 
specified wall thickness. 
9.2 Type S Pipe-As an alternative to the hydrostatic test at 
the option of the manufacturer or if specified in the purchase 
order, the full body of each seamless pipe shall be tested with 
a nondestructive electric test in accordance with Practice E213, 
E309, or E570. In such cases, each length so furnished shall 
include the mandatory marking of the letters "NDE." Except as 
allowed by 9.2.6.2, it is the intent of this nondestructive electric 
test to reject pipe with imperfections that produce test signals 
equal to or greater than those produced by the applicable 
calibration standards. 
9.2.1 If the nondestructive electric test has been performed, 
the lengths shall be marked with the letters "NDE." The 
certification, if required, shall state Nondestructive Electric 
Tested and shall indicate which of the tests was applied. Also, 
the letters NDE shall be appended to the product specification 
number and grade shown on the certification. 
9 .2.2 The following information is intended to facilitate the 
use of this specification: 
9.2.2.1 The calibration standards defined in 9.2.3 through 
9.2.5 are convenient standards for calibration of nondestructive 
testing equipment. The dimensions of such standards are not to 
be construed as the minimum sizes of imperfections detectable 
by such equipment. 
9.2.2.2 The ultrasonic testing referred to in this specification 
is capable of detecting the presence and location of significant 
longitudinally or circumferentially oriented imperfections; 
however, different techniques need to be employed for the 
detection of differently oriented imperfections. Ultrasonic test­
ing is not necessarily capable of detecting short, deep imper­
fections. 
9.2.2.3 The eddy current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
discontinuities, especially of the short abrupt type. 
9.2.2.4 The flux leakage examination referred to in this 
specification is capable of detecting the presence and location 
of significant longitudinally or transversely oriented disconti­
nuities. The provisions of this specification only require 
longitudinal calibration for flux leakage. Different techniques 
need to be employed for the detection of differently oriented 
imperfections. 
9.2.2.5 The hydrostatic test referred to in 8.2 has the 
capability of finding imperfections of a size permitting the test 
fluid to leak through the tube wall and may be either visually 
seen or detected by a loss of pressure. Hydrostatic testing is not 
necessarily capable of detecting very tight through-the-wall 
imperfections or imperfections that extend an appreciable 
distance into the wall without complete penetration. 
144 
9.2.2.6 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of imperfections that are 
capable of being detected in the specific application of these 
examinations is directed to discuss this with the manufacturer 
of the tubular product. 
9.23 For ultrasonic testing, the calibration reference 
notches shall be at the option of the manufacturer, and shall be 
any one of the three common notch shapes shown in Practice 
E213. The depth of notch shall not exceed 12.5 % of the 
specified wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], 
whichever is the greater.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-53/SA-53M 
9.2.4 For eddy current testing, the calibration pipe shall 
contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following calibration standards to establish a minimum sensi­
tivity level for rejection. 
9.2.4.1 Drilled Hole-The calibration pipe shall contain 
three holes spaced 120° apart or four holes spaced 90° apart, 
sufficiently separated longitudinally to ensure separately dis­
tinguishable responses. The holes shall be drilled radially and 
completely through the pipe wall, care being taken to avoid 
distortion of the pipe while drilling. Dependent upon the 
nominal pipe size, the calibration pipe shall contain the 
following hole: 
NPS DN Diameter of Drilled Hole 
:51/2 :,; 15 0.039 In. [1.0 mm] 
> ½ :5 1¼ > 15 :,; 32 0.055 in. [1.4 mm]

> 2:,; 5 > 50:,; 125 0.087 in. [2.2 mm] 
>5 > 125 0.106 in. [2.7 mm] 
9.2.4.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool or 
file with a ¼ in. [6 mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe. The notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater. 
9.2.4.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
pipe axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to a depth not 
exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
9.2.4.4 Compatibility-The calibration standards in the cali­
bration pipe shall be compatible with the testing equipment and 
the method being used. 
9.2.5 For flux leakage testing, the longitudinal calibration 
reference notches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a 
radial plane parallel to the pipe axis. For specified wall 
thicknesses less than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], outside and inside 
notches shall be used. For specified wall thicknesses equal to or 
greater than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], only an outside notch shall be 
used. The notch depth shall not exceed 12.5 % of the specified 
wall thickness, or 0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater. 
The notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25 mm], and the notch 
width shall not exceed the notch depth. Outside diameter and 
inside diameter notches shall be located sufficiently apart to 
allow separation and identification of the signals. 
9.2.6 Pipe containing one or more imperfections that pro­
duce a signal equal to or greater than the signal produced by the 
calibration standard shall be rejected or the area producing the 
signal shall be rejected. 
9.2.6.1 Test signals produced by imperfections that cannot 
be identified, or produced by cracks or crack-like 
imperfections, shall result in rejection of the pipe, unless it is 
repaired and retested. To be accepted, the pipe shall pass the 
same specification test to which it was originally subjected and 
the remaining wall thickness shall not have been decreased 
below that permitted by the specification. It shall be permis­
sible to reduce the outside diameter at the point of grinding by 
the amount so removed. 
9.2.6.2 It shall be permissible to evaluate test signals pro­
duced by visual imperfections in accordance with the provi­
sions of Section 12. A few examples of such imperfections are 
straightener marks, cutting chips, scratches, steel die stamps, 
stop marks, or pipe reducer ripple. 
9.2.7 The test methods described in Section 9 are not 
necessarily capable of inspecting the end portion of pipes. This 
condition is referred to as end effect. The length of the end 
effect shall be determined by the manufacturer and, if specified 
in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
10. Permissible Variations in Weight (Mass) and 
Dimensions 
10.1 Weight (Mass)-The weight (mass) of the pipe shall 
not vary more than± 10 % from its specified weight (mass), as 
derived by multiplying its measured length by its specified 
weight (mass) per unit length, as given in Table X2.2 or Table 
X2.3, or as calculated using the relevant equation in ASME 
B36.10M. 
No'!B 6-For pipe NPS 4 [DN 100] or smaller, the weight (mass) 
tolerance is applicable to the weights (masses) of the customary lifts of 
pipe as produced for shipment by the mill. For pipe larger than NPS 4 [DN 
100], where individual lengths are weighed, the weight (mass) tolerance is 
applicable to the individual lengths. 
10.2 Diameter-For pipe NPS 1 ½ [DN 40] or smaller, the 
outside diameter at any point shall not vary more than ± 1/64 in. 
[0.4 mm] from the specified outside diameter. For pipe NPS 2 
[DN 50] or larger, the outside diameter shall not vary more 
than ± 1 % from the specified outside diameter. 
10.3 Thickness-The minimum wall thickness at any point 
shall be not more than 12.5 % under the specified wall 
thickness. The minimum wall thickness on inspection shall 
conform to the requirements given in Table X2.4. 
11. End Finish 
11.1 If ordered with plain ends, the pipe shall be furnished 
to the following practice, unless otherwise specified. 
11.1.1 NPS 1½ [DN 40] or Smaller-Unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order, end finish shall be at the option 
of the manufacturer. 
11.1.2 Larger than NPS l½ [DN 40]: 
11.1.2.1 Pipe of standard-weight or extra-strong weight, or 
in wall thickness less than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], other than 
double extra-strong weight pipe, shall be plain-end beveled 
with ends beveled to an angle of 30°, +5°, -0°, measured from 
a line drawn perpendicular to the axis of the pipe, and with a 
root face of 1/16 in. ± 1/32 in. [1.6 mm ± 0.8 mm]. 
145 
11.1.2.2 Pipe with a specified wall thickness greater than 
0.500 in. [12.7 mm], and all double extra-strong weight pipe, 
shall be plain-end square cut. 
11.2 If ordered with threaded ends, the pipe ends shall be 
provided with a thread in accordance with the gaging practice 
and tolerances of ANSI B 1.20.1. For standard-weight pipe NPS 
6 [DN 150] or smaller, refer to Table X3.l for threading data. 
For standard-weight pipe NPS 8 [DN 200] or larger and all 
sizes of extra-strong weight pipe and double extra-strong 
weight pipe, refer to Table X3.2 for threading data. Threaded

=== Page 198 ===

SA-53/SA-53M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
pipe NPS 4 [DN 100] or larger shall have thread protectors on 
the ends not protected by a coupling. 
11.3 If ordered with couplings, one end of each length of 
pipe shall be provided with a coupling manufactured in 
accordance with Specification A865/ A865M. The coupling 
threads shall be in accordance with the gaging practice of ANSI 
B 1.20.1. The coupling shall be applied handling-tight, unless 
power-tight is specified in the purchase order. Couplings are to 
be made of steel. Taper-tapped couplings shall be furnished on 
all threaded pipe NPS 2½ [DN 65] or larger. For pipe smaller 
than NPS 2½ [DN 65], it is regular practice to furnish 
straight-tapped couplings for standard-weight pipe and taper­
tapped couplings for extra-strong and double extra-strong 
weight pipe. If taper-tapped couplings are required for 
standard-weight pipe smaller than NPS 2½ [DN 65], it is 
recommended that line pipe threads in accordance with API 
Specification 5B be ordered. The taper-tapped couplings pro­
vided on line pipe in such sizes may be used on mill-threaded 
standard-weight pipe of the same size. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient num­
ber of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable 
assurance that they have been properly evaluated with respect 
to depth. 
12.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 12.5 % 
of the specified wall thickness or encroach on the minimum 
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with defects 
shall be given one or more of the following dispositions: 
12.2.1 The defect shall be removed by grinding, provided 
that the remaining wall thickness is within specified limits, 
12.2.2 Type S pipe and the parent metal of Type E pipe, 
except within ½ in. [13 mm] of the fusion line of the 
electric-resistance-weld seam, are permitted to be repaired in 
accordance with the welding provisions of 12.5. Repair weld­
ing of Type F pipe and the weld seam of Type E pipe is 
prohibited. 
12.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect shall be cut 
off within the limits of requirement on length, or rejected. 
12.3 At the purchaser's discretion, pipe shall be subjected to 
rejection if surface defects repaired in accordance with 12.2 are 
not scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is 
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall 
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
12.4 For the removal of imperfections and defects by 
grinding, a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the 
wall thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by 
this specification. It shall be permissible to reduce the outside 
diameter at the point of grinding by the amount so removed. 
12.5 Weld repair shall only be permitted with the approval 
of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification A530/ 
A530M. 
12.6 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight. 
12.7 The pipe shall contain no dents greater than 10 % of 
the pipe diameter or ¼ in. [6 mm], whichever is smaller, 
146 
measured as the gap between the lowest point of the dent and 
a prolongation of the original contour of the pipe. Cold-formed 
dents deeper than 1/s in. [3 mm] shall be free of sharp-bottomed 
gouges; it shall be permissible to remove the gouges by 
grinding, provided that the remaining wall thickness is within 
specified limits. The length of the dent in any direction shall 
not exceed one half the specified outside diameter of the pipe. 
13. Number of Tests 
13.1 Except as required by 13.2, one of each of the tests 
specified in Section 7 shall be made on test specimens taken 
from one length of pipe from each lot of each pipe size. For 
continuous-welded pipe, each lot shall contain no more than 25 
tons [23 Mg] of pipe for pipe sizes NPS 1 ½ [DN 40] and 
smaller, and no more than 50 tons [ 45 Mg] of pipe for pipe 
sizes larger than NPS 1 ½ [DN 40]. For seamless and electric­
resistance-welded pipe, a lot shall contain no more than one 
heat, and at the option of the manufacturer shall contain no 
more than 500 lengths of pipe (as initially cut after the final 
pipe-forming operation, prior to any further cutting to the 
required ordered lengths) or 50 tons [45 Mg] of pipe. 
13.2 The number of flattening tests for electric-resistance­
welded pipe shall be in accordance with 7.3.3.2 or 7.3.3.3, 
whichever is applicable. 
13.3 Except as allowed by 9.2, each length of pipe shall be 
subjected to the hydrostatic test (see Section 8). 
14. Retests 
14.1 Except for flattening tests of electric-resistance-welded 
pipe, if the results of a mechanical test for a lot fail to conform 
to the applicable requirements specified in Section 7, the lot 
shall be rejected unless tests of additional pipe from the 
affected lot of double the number originally tested are subse­
quently made and each such test conforms to the specified 
requirements. Only one retest of any lot will be permitted. Any 
individual length of pipe that conforms to the test requirements 
is acceptable. Any individual length of pipe that does not 
conform to the test requirements may be resubmitted for test 
and will be considered acceptable if tests taken from each pipe 
end conform to the specified requirements. 
14.2 Electric-Resistance-Welded Pipe Produced in Single 
Lengths-If any flattening test result fails to conform to the 
requirements specified in 7.3.3, the affected single length shall 
be rejected unless the failed end is subsequently retested using 
the same weld orientation as the failed test and a satisfactory 
test result is obtained before the pipe's length is reduced by 
such testing to less than 80 % of its length after the initial 
cropping. 
14.3 Electric-Resistance-Welded Pipe Produced in Multiple 
Lengths-If any flattening test result fails to conform to the 
requirements specified in 7.3.3, the affected multiple length 
shall be rejected or flattening tests shall be made using a test 
specimen taken from each end of each individual length in the 
failed multiple length. For each pipe end, such tests shall be 
made with the weld alternately at 0° and 90° from the line of 
direction of force. Individual lengths are considered acceptable 
if the test results for both pipe ends conform to the specified 
requirements.

15. Test Methods 
15.1 The test specimens and the tests required by this 
specification shall conform to those described in the latest issue 
of Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
15.2 Each longitudinal tension test specimen shall be taken 
from a pipe end and shall not be flattened between the gage 
marks. 
15.3 Test specimens for bend tests and flattening tests shall 
be taken from pipe. Test specimens for flattening tests shall be 
smooth on the ends and free from burrs. 
15.4 Tests shall be conducted at room temperature. 
16. Lengths 
16.1 Unless otherwise specified, pipe lengths shall be in 
accordance with the following regular practices: 
16.1.1 Except as allowed by 16.1.2 and 16.1.4, pipe lighter 
than extra-strong weight shall be in single-random lengths of 
16 to 22 ft [4.88 to 6.71 m], with not more than 5 % of the total 
number of threaded lengths furnished being jointers (two 
pieces coupled together). 
16.1.2 For plain-end pipe lighter than extra-strong weight, it 
shall be permissible for not more than 5 % of the total number 
of pipe to be in lengths of 12 to 16 ft [3.66 to 4.88 m]. 
16.1.3 Pipe of extra-strong weight or heavier shall be in 
random lengths of 12 to 22 ft [3.66 to 6.71 m], except that it 
shall be permissible for not more than 5 % of the total of pipe 
to be in lengths of 6 to 12 ft [1.83 to 3.66 m]. 
16.1.4 For extra-strong weight or lighter pipe ordered in 
double-random lengths, the minimum lengths shall be not less 
than 22 ft [6.71 m] and the minimum average length for the 
order shall be not less than 35 ft [10.67 m]. 
16.1.5 For pipe heavier than extra-strong weight ordered in 
lengths longer than single random, the lengths shall be as 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
16.1.6 If pipe is furnished threaded and coupled, the length 
shall be measured to the outer face of the coupling. 
17. Galvanized Pipe 
17 .1 Galvanized pipe ordered under this specification shall 
be coated with zinc inside and outside by the hot-dip process. 
The zinc used for the coating shall be any grade of zinc 
conforming to Specification B6. The galvanized pipe shall be 
free from uncoated areas, blisters, flux deposits, and gross 
dross inclusions. Lumps, projections, globules, or heavy de­
posits of zinc which will interfere with the intended use of the 
material will not be permitted. 
17.2 Weight (Mass) per Unit Area of Coating-The weight 
(mass) per unit area of zinc coating shall be not less than 1.8 
oz/ft 2 [0.55 kg/m 2 ] as determined from the average results of 
the two specimens taken for test in the manner prescribed in 
17.5 and not less than 1.6 oz/ft2 [0.49 kg/m 2 ] for each of these 
specimens. The weight (mass) per unit area of coating, ex­
pressed in ounces per square foot [kilograms per square metre] 
shall be calculated by dividing the total weight (mass) of zinc, 
inside plus outside, by the total area, inside plus oµtside, of the 
surface coated. Each specimen shall have not less than 1.3 
oz/ft2 [0.40 kg/m 2 ] of zinc coating on each surface, calculated 
by dividing the total weight (mass) of zinc on the given surface 
( outside or inside) by the area of the surface coated ( outside or 
inside). 
17.3 Weight (Mass) per Unit Area of Coating Test-The 
weight (mass) per unit area of zinc coating shall be determined 
by stripping tests in accordance with Test Method A90/ A90M. 
17.4 Test Specimens-Test specimens for determination of 
weight (mass) per unit area of coating shall be cut approxi­
mately 4 in. [100 mm] in length. 
17.5 Number of Tests-Two test specimens for the determi­
nation of weight (mass) per unit area of coating shall be taken, 
one from each end of one length of galvanized pipe selected at 
random from each lot of 500 lengths, or fraction thereof, of 
each size. 
17.6 Retests-If the weight (mass) per unit area of coating 
of any lot does not conform to the requirements specified in 
17 .2, retests of two additional pipes from the same lot shall be 
made, each of which shall conform to the specified require­
ments. 
17. 7 If pipe ordered under this specification is to be 
galvanized, the tension, flattening, and bend tests shall be made 
on the base material before galvanizing, if practicable. If 
specified, results of the mechanical tests on the base material 
shall be reported to the purchaser. If it is impracticable to make 
the mechanical tests on the base material before galvanizing, it 
shall be permissible to make such tests on galvanized samples, 
and any flaking or cracking of the zinc coating shall not be 
considered cause for rejection. If galvanized pipe is bent or 
otherwise fabricated to a degree that causes the zinc coating to 
stretch or compress beyond the limit of elasticity, some flaking 
of the coating is acceptable. 
18. Inspection 
18.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry, at all times while work on the contract of the purchaser 
is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's works 
that concern the manufacture of the pipe ordered. The manu­
facturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities to be 
satisfied that the pipe is being furnished in accordance with this 
specification. All tests ( except product analysis) and inspection 
shall be made at the place of manufacture prior to shipment, 
unless otherwise specified, and shall be so conducted as not to 
interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the works. 
19. Rejection 
19.1 The purchaser is permitted to inspect each length of 
pipe received from the manufacturer and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of this specification based upon the inspection 
and test method as outlined in the specification, the length shall 
be rejected and the manufacturer shall be notified. Disposition 
of rejected pipe shall be a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
19.2 Pipe found in fabrication or in installation to be 
unsuitable for the intended use, under the scope and require­
ments of this specification, shall be set aside and the manufac­
turer notified. Such pipe shall be subject to mutual investiga­
tion as to the nature and severity of the deficiency and the 
147

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the purchase order. 
The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test than is provided in the supplementary 
requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, retest and retreatment 
provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. 
Sl. Flattening Test, Seamless Pipe 
Sl.1 A test specimen at least 2½ in. [60 mm] in length shall 
be flattened cold between parallel plates in two steps. During 
the first step, which is a test for ductility, except as allowed by 
S 1.3, S 1.4, and S 1.5, no cracks or breaks on the inside, outside, 
or end surfaces shall be present before the distance between the 
plates is less than the value of H calculated as follows: 
H = (1 +e)tl(e+t!D) 
where: 
H = distance between flattening plates, in. [mm], 
e = deformation per unit length (constant for a given grade 
of steel, 0.09 for Grade A, and 0.07 for Grade B), 
t = specified wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
D = specified outside diameter, in. [mm] 
The H values have been calculated for standard-weight and 
extra-heavy weight pipe from NPS 2V2 to NPS 24 [DN 65 to 
DN 600], inclusive, and are given in Table X2.1. 
Sl.2 During the second step, which is a test for soundness, 
the flattening shall be continued until the test specimen breaks 
or the opposite sides of the test specimen meet. Evidence of 
laminated or unsound material that is revealed during the entire 
flattening test shall be cause for rejection. 
Sl.3 Surface imperfections in the test specimen before 
flattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening 
test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements 
in Section 12. 
S 1.4 Superficial ruptures as a result of surface imperfections 
shall not be cause for rejection. 
Sl.5 For pipe with a D-to-t ratio less than 10, because the 
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the 
inside surface at the 6 and 12 o'clock locations, cracks at such 
locations shall not be cause for rejection. 
Sl.6 One test shall be made on test specimens taken from 
one length of pipe from each lot of each pipe size. A lot shall 
contain no more than one heat, and at the option of the 
manufacturer shall contain no more than 500 lengths of pipe 
(as initially cut after the final pipe-forming operation, prior to 
any further cutting to the required ordered lengths) or 50 tons 
[ 45 Mg] of pipe. 
S 1. 7 If the results of a test for a lot fail to conform to the 
applicable requirements, the lot shall be rejected unless tests of 
additional pipe from the affected lot of double the number 
originally tested are subsequently made and each such test 
conforms to the specified requirements. Only one retest of any 
lot will be permitted. Any individual length of pipe that 
conforms to the test requirements is acceptable. Any individual 
length of pipe that does not conform to the test requirements 
may be resubmitted for test and will be considered acceptable 
if tests taken from each pipe end conform to the specified 
requirements.

Xl. DEFINITIONS OF TYPES OF PIPE 
Xl.1 Type F, Furnace-Butt-Welded Pipe, Continuous-
Welded Pipe-Pipe produced in multiple lengths from 
coiled skelp and subsequently cut into individual lengths, 
having its longitudinal butt joint forge welded by the mechani­
cal pressure developed in rolling the hot-formed skelp through 
a set of round pass welding rolls. 
Xl.2 Type E, Electric-Resistance-Welded Pipe-Pipe pro­
duced in single lengths, or in multiple lengths from coiled 
skelp and subsequently cut into individual lengths, having a 
149 
longitudinal butt joint wherein coalescence is produced by the 
heat obtained from resistance of the pipe to the flow of electric 
current in a circuit of which the pipe is a part, and by the 
application of pressure. 
Xl.3 Type S, Seamless Pipe-Pipe made without a welded 
seam. It is manufactured by hot working steel and, if necessary, 
by subsequently cold finishing the hot-worked tubular product 
to produce the desired shape, dimensions, and properties.

A The minimum test pressure for outside diameters and wall thicknesses not listed shall be computed by the formula given below. The computed test pressure shall be 
used in all cases, except as follows: 
( 1) For specified wall thicknesses greater than the heaviest specified wall thickness listed in this table for the applicable specified outside diameter, the test pressure 
shall be the highest value listed for the applicable specified outside diameter and grade. 
(2) For pipe smaller than NPS 2 [DN 50] with a specified wall thickness less than the lightest specified wall thickness listed in this table for the applicable specified outside 
diameter and grade. 
(3) For all sizes of Grade A and B pipe smaller than NPS 2 [DN 50], the test pressures were assigned arbitrarily. Test pressures for intermediate specified outside 
diameters need not exceed those given in this table for the next larger listed size. 
P=2St!D 
where: 
P minimum hydrostatic test pressure, psi [kPa], 
S 0.60 times the specified minimum yield strength, psi [kPa], 
t specified wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
D specified outside diameter, in. [mm].

TABLE X2.4 Table of Minimum Permissible Wall Thicknesses on Inspection for Pipe Specified Wall Thicknesses 
NoTE 1-The following equation, upon which this table is based, shall be applied to calculate minimum permissible wall thickness from specified wall 
thickness: 
ts X 0.875 = tm 
where: 
t. = specified wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
tm = minimum pennissible wall thickness, in. [mm]. 
The wall thickness is expressed to three [two] decimal places, the fourth [third] decimal place being carried forward or dropped in accordance with 
Practice E29. 
NoTE 2-This table is a master table covering wall thicknesses available in the purchase of different classifications of pipe, but it is not meant to imply 
that all of the walls listed therein are obtainable under this specification.
