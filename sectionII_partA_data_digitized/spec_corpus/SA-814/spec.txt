SA·814/SA-814M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Cold-Worked Welded Austenitic Stainless Steel Pipe 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers two classes of flanged and 
cold-bending quality cold-worked straight-seam single or 
double welded austenitic steel pipe intended for high­
temperature and general corrosive services. 
NoTE 1-When the impact test criterion for a low-temperature service 
would be 15 ft,lbf [20 J] energy absorption or 15 mils [0.38 mm] lateral 
expansion, some of the austenitic stainless steel grades covered by this 
specification are accepted by certain pressure vessel or piping codes 
without the necessity of making the actual test. For example, Grades 304, 
304L, and 347 are accepted by the ASME Pressure Vessel Code, Section 
VIII Division 1, and by the Chemical Plant and Refinery Piping Code, 
ANSI 831.3 for service at temperatures as low as -425 °F [-250 °C] 
without qualification by impact tests. Other AISI stainless steel grades are 
usually accepted for service temperatures as low as -325 °F [-200 °C] 
without impact testing. Impact testing may, under certain circumstances, 
be required. For example, materials with chromium or nickel content 
outside the AISI ranges, and for material with carbon content exceeding 
0.10 %, are required to be impact tested under the rules of ASME Section 
VIII Division 1 when service temperatures are lower than -50 °F [-45 
oq, 
1.2 Grades TP304H, TP304N, TP316H, TP316N, TP321H, 
TP347H, and TP348H are modifications of Grades TP304, 
TP316, TP321, TP347, and TP348, and are intended for 
high-temperature service. 
1.3 Two classes of pipe are covered as follows: 
1.3.1 Class SW-Pipe, single-welded with no addition of 
filler metal and 
1.3.2 Class DW-Pipe, double-welded with no addition of 
filler metal. 
1.4 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for 
pipe where a greater degree of testing is desired. These 
supplementary requirements call for additional tests to be made 
and, when desired, one or more of these may be specified in the 
order. 
1.5 Table 1 lists the dimensions of cold-worked single- or 
double-welded stainless steel pipe. Pipe having other dimen-
sions may be furnished provided such pipe complies with all 
other requirements of this specification. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3.1.10 Specification designation, and 
3 .1.11 Special requirements or exceptions to the specifica­
tion. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Manufacture: 
4.1.1 The pipe shall be made by a machine-welding or an 
automatic-welding process, welding from one or both sides and 
producing full penetration welds with no addition of filler 
metal in the welding operation. 
4.1.2 Weld repairs, with the addition of compatible filler 
metal, may be made to the weld joint in accordance with the 
requirements of the section on Repair by Welding of Specifi­
cation A999/A999M. 
4.1.3 Prior to final heat treatment of the pipe, the weld bead 
must be cold-worked by methods such as forging, planishing, 
drawing, swaging or bead rolling so as to obtain a flush

7.2 Alignment (Camber)-Using a 3-ft [1.0-m] straightedge 
placed so that both ends are in contact with the pipe, the 
camber shall not be more than 0.030-in. [0.8-mm]. 
7.3 Thickness-The wall thickness at any point in the pipe 
shall be within the thickness tolerance specified in Table 1, 
except that for pipe in which the wall thickness exceeds 
0.188-in. [4.8-mm] a weld reinforcement of up to 0.015-in. 
[0.38-mm] is permitted on the inside of the pipe. 
8. Lengths 
8.1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following 
regular practice. 
8.1.1 Unless otherwise agreed upon, all sizes up to and 
including NPS 4 are available in a length up to 24 ft (Note 2) 
with the permissible range of 15 to 24 ft (Note 2). 
Norn 2-The value(s) applies when the inch-pound designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase. When the "M" designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase, the corresponding metric value(s) 
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
8.1.2 If definite cut lengths are desired, the lengths required 
shall be specified in the order. No pipe shall be under the 
specified length and not more than ¼ in. [6 mm] over that 
specified. 
8.1.3 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise specified. 
9. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
9.1 The finished pipes shall be free of injurious imperfec­
tions and shall have a workmanlike finish. Minor imperfections 
may be removed by grinding, provided the wall thicknesses are 
not decreased to less than that permitted in Section 7. 
10. General Requirements 
10.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A999/ A999M unless otherwise provided herein. 
11. Examination of Double-Welded Pipe 
11.1 Both ends of each double-welded (Class DW) pipe 
shall be visually examined to determine that complete fusion 
was attained between the two welds. In lieu of examining the 
ends of the pipe, this examination may be performed on 
cropped ends removed from both ends of each double welded 
pipe. 
12. Mechanical Tests Required 
12.1 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One tension 
test shall be made on a specimen for lots of not more than 100 
pipes. Tension tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes 
for lots of more than 100 pipes. 
NOTE 3-The term "lot," for mechanical tests, applies to all pipe of the 
same nominal size and wall thickness (or schedule) which is produced 
from the same heat of steel and subjected to the same finishing treatment 
(J) in a continuous heat-treatment furnace, or (2) in a batch-type 
heat-treatment furnace, equipped with recording pyrometers and automati­
cally controlled within a 50 °F [30 °C] range, the larger of (a) Each 200 
ft [60 m] or fraction thereof or, (b) That pipe heat treated in the same batch 
furnace charge. 
12.2 Flattening Test-For material heat treated in a batch­
type furnace, flattening tests shall be made of 5 % of the pipe 
from each heat-treated lot. For material heat treated by the 
continuous process, this test shall be made on a sufficient 
number of pipe to constitute 5 % of the lot, but in no case less 
than two lengths of pipe. 
12.2.1 For pipe where the diameter equals or exceeds NPS 
10, a transverse-guided face bend test of the weld may be 
conducted instead of a flattening test in accordance with the 
method outlined in the steel tubular product supplement of Test 
Methods and Definitions A370. The ductility of the weld shall 
be considered acceptable when there is no evidence of cracks 
in the weld or between the weld and the base metal after 
bending. Test specimens from 5 % of the lot shall be taken 
from the pipe or test plates of the same material as the pipe, the 
test plates being attached to the end of the cylinder and welded 
as a prolongation of the pipe longitudinal seam. 
12.3 Hydrostatic Test-Each length of pipe shall be sub­
jected to the hydrostatic test in accordance with Specification 
A999/ A999M. 
13. Product Marking 
13.1 In addition to the marking specified in Specification 
A999/ A999M, the marking shall include the manufacturer's 
identifying mark and double-welded pipe shall be identified 
with the mark (DW). For Grades TP304H, TP316H, TP321H, 
TP347H, TP348H, and S30815, the marking shall also include 
the heat number and heat-treatment lot identification. If speci­
fied in the purchase order, the marking for pipe larger than NPS 
4 shall include the weight.

Standard Specification for 
Wrought Ferritic, Ferritic/Austenitic, and Martensitic 
Stainless Steel Piping Fittings 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers two general classes, WP and 
CR, of wrought ferritic, ferritic/austenitic, and martensitic 
stainless steel fittings of seamless and welded construction 
covered by the latest revision of Specification A960/ A960M. 
Fittings differing from these standards may be furnished in 
accordance with Supplementary Requirement S58 of Specifi-
cation A960/ A960M. • 
1.1.1 Class WP fittings are subdivided into four subclasses: 
Classes WP-S, WP-W, WP-WX, and WP-WU. They are 
manufactured to the requirements of Specification A960/ 
A960M, and they shall have pressure ratings compatible with 
12.2. Class WP-S fittings are those manufactured from seam­
less product by a seamless method of manufacture (marked 
with class symbol WP-S); Class WP-W fittings are those which 
contain welds where the fitting fabrication or construction 
welds have been radiographed (marked with class symbol 
WP-W); and Class WP-WX fittings are those which contain 
welds where all welds have been radiographed (marked with 
class symbol WP-WX); and Class WP-WU fittings are those 
which contain welds where all welds have been ultrasonically 
tested (marked with class symbol WP-WU). 
1.1.2 Class CR fittings are those manufactured to the 
requirements of MSS SP-43, and they shall have pressure 
ratings compatible with 12.3. 
1.2 This specification does not apply to cast fittings. 
1.3 Optional supplementary requirements are provided. 
When desired, one or more of these may be specified in the 
order. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation [SI units], the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound .units. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard.

tensile test made on the starting material may be certification 
that the material of hot-finished fittings meets the tensile 
requirements of this specification provided the heat treatments 
are the same. For purposes of tensile, yield and elongation 
requirements listed in Table 3, the tensile specimen shall 
consist of base metal only. If the purchaser requires results, 
involving the weld, in addition to the base metal only results, 
then the S2 supplemental requirement of this specification shall 
be specified on the purchase order. When S2 is specified, the 
weld metal must meet only the minimum ultimate tensile 
strength of Table 3. 
9. Hardness Requirements 
9.1 Fittings shall not exceed the maximum hardness shown 
in Table 3. 
10. Dimensions 
10.1 The sizes, shapes, and dimensions of the fittings

but meeting all other requirements of this specification, may be 
furnished in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S58 
of Specification A960/A960M. 
11. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
11.1 Fittings supplied under this specification shall be 
examined visually. Selected typical surface discontinuities 
shall be explored for depth. The fittings shall be free from 
smface discontinuities that penetrate more than 5 % of the 
specified nominal wall thickness, except as defined in 11.3 and 
11 .4, and shall have a workmanlike finish. 
11.2 Surface discontinuities deeper than 5 % of the specified 
nominal wall thickness, except as defined in 11.3 and 11.4, 
shall be removed by the manufacturer by machining or 
grinding to sound metal, and the repaired areas shall be well 
faired. The waJl thiclmess at all points shall be at least 87½ % 
of the specified nominal wall thickness, and the diameters at all 
points shall be within the specified limits. 
11.3 Surface checks (fish scale) deeper than 1/64 in. [0.4 mm] 
shall be removed. 
11.4 Mechanical marks deeper than 1/16 in. (1.6 mm] shall be 
rernoved. 
1 LS When the removal of a surface discontinuity reduces 
the wall thickness below 87½ % of the specified nominal wall 
thickness at any point, the fitting shall be subject to rejection or 
to repair as provided in 11.6. 
11.6 Repair by Welding: 
11.6.1 Repair welding, of the base metal by the manufac­
turer, is pem1issible for fittings made to the dimensional 
standards listed in HU or for other standard fittings made for 
stock. Prior approval of the purchaser is required to repair 
special fittings made to the purchaser's requirements. Repair 
by welding shall neither exceed 10 % of the outside surface 
area of the fitting nor 33 1/2 % of the nominal wall thickness.

in accordance with Specification A960/A960M. 
11.6.3 The alloy content (carbon, chromium, nickel, molyb­
denum, columbium, and titanium) of the deposited weld metal 
shall be within the same percentage range as permitted for the 
base metal. (Warning-When selecting the filler metal and 
welding procedure, consideration should be given to their 
effect on corrosion resistance in service.) 
11.6.4 Surface discontinuities deeper than 5 % of the speci­
fied nominal wall thickness shall be removed by mechanical 
means or thermal cutting or gouging methods. Cavities pre­
pared for welding shall be examined by the liquid penetrant 
method of Practice E165. No cracks shall be permitted in the 
prepared cavities. 
11.6.5 The weld repair shall be permanently identified with 
the welder's stamp or symbol in accordance with Specification 
A960/ A960M. 
11.6.6 Weld repair area(s) shall be blended uniformly to the 
base metal and shall be examined by liquid penetrant in 
accordance with Practice El65. No cracks shall be permitted in 
the weld or surrounding ½ in. [13 mm] of base metal. 
11.6.7 After weld repair, material shall be heat treated in 
accordance with Section 6. 
11.7 The fittings shall be cleaned free of scale.

Molybdenum-Vanadium 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers chromium-molybdenum­
vanadium alloy steel plates intended primarily for the fabrica­
tion of welded pressure vessels. 
1.2 The plates furnished under this specification are re­
quired to be normalized-and-tempered. Specification A542/ 
A542M includes coverage of the material in the quenched-and­
tempered condition. 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates furnished to this 
specification is limited only by the capacity of the composition 
to meet the specified property requirements. 
1.4 The material is intended to be suitable for fusion 
welding. Welding technique is of fundamental importance and 
it is presupposed that welding procedures will be in accordance 
with approved methods. 
1.5 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system must be used independentl.{ of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification .. 
1.7 This jnternational standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

SA-841/SA-841M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Steel Plates for Pressure Vessels, Produced by Thermo­
Mechanical Control Process (TMCP) 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers steel plates produced by the 
thermo-mechanical control process (TMCP). The plates are 
intended primarily for use in welded pressure vessels. A 
description of the TMCP method is given in Appendix XL 
1.2 Due to the inherent characteristics of the TMCP method, 
the plates cannot be formed at elevated temperatures without 
sustaining significant losses in strength and toughness. Except 
for Grade G, the plates may be formed and post-weld heat­
treated at temperatures not exceeding 1200°F [650°C], provid­
ing the requirements of 6.1 are met. Grade G plates may be 
formed at temperatures not exceeding 985°F [530°C] provided 
the requirements of 6.1 are met. 
1.3 The maximum permitted nominal thickness of plates 
furnished to this specification is 4 in. [100 mm] for Grades A, 
B, and C; 1.5 in. [40 mm] for Grades D, E, and F; and 2 in. 
[50 mm] for Grade G. 
1.4 Grade G is susceptible to magnetization. Use of magnets 
in handling after heat treatment should be avoided if residual 
magnetism would be detrimental to subsequent fabrication or 
service. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents. Therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with this specifi­
cation. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

cooled directly after rolling without being allowed to cool 
below 1025°F [550°CJ. Quenching hardening shall be initiated 
from a temperature within the range from 1025 to 1490°F [550 
to 810°C]. 
S64.2 Subsequent to quenching, the plates shall be tem­
pered within the range from 1030 to 1155°F [555 to 625°C], 
holding at that temperature for a minimum of 30 min/in. [1.2 
min/mm] of thickness but for not less than 15 min, and then 
cooling at a rate of not less than 300°F/h [165°C/h], either in 
air or by quenching in water, to ambient temperature. 
S64.3 Prior to the tempering treatment, the plates may be 
subjected to an intermediate heat treatment (Note S64.1) 
consisting of heating to a temperature in the range from 1185 
to 1310°F [640 to 710°C], holding at that temperature for a 
minimum of 1 hr/in. [2.4 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case 
less than 15 min, and then water-quenching to below 300°F 
[150°C] in the case of plate thicknesses of more than 5/s in. [16 
mm]; or cooling in air or water-quenching in the case of plate 
thickness of 5/s in. [16 mm] and under. 
NOTE S64.1-The intermediate heat treatment is for the purpose of 
enhancing elongation and notch-toughness and for reducing susceptibility 
to strain-aging embrittlement and temper embrittlement. It may be 
performed at the option of the material manufacturer or may be specified 
by the purchaser. 
S64.4 Heat treatment temperatures and times shall be re­
ported in accordance with Section 19 of Specification A20/ 
A20M. 
S77. Carbon Equivalent Limit 
S77.1 The carbon equivalent, on heat analysis, shall not 
exceed the limits listed in this section when based on the 
following equation:

APPENDIX 
(Nomnandatory Information) 
Xl. THERMO-MECHANICAL CONTROLLED PROCESSING (TMCP) 
Xl.1 Introduction-The Thermo•Mechanical Controlled 
Processing, commonly referred . to as "TMCP," has evolved 
from the "controlled rolling" (CR) processes, which have been 
known and used for a number of years. TMCP produces 
fine-grained steel by a combination of chemical composition 
and integrated controls of manufacturing processes from slab 
reheating to post-rolling cooling, thereby achieving the speci­
fied mechanical properties in the required plate thicknesses. 
TMCP requires accurate control of both the steel temperature 
and rolling reductions, and does not involve coiling after the 
post- cooling. 
Xl.2 Outline of TMCP As May Be applied to Grades A 
through F-As shown in Fig. Xl.l, TMCP for those grades 
may incorporate three processes, as follows: 
Xl.2.1 Thermo-Mechanical Rolling (TMR)-Steels of fine 
grain size are produced by rolling in the recrystallization and 
the nonrecrystallization regions of austenite, and sometimes in 
the dual-phase temperature region of austenite and ferrite. 
Generally, a high proportion of the rolling reduction is per•

formed close to, or below, the temperature at which austenite 
begins to transform to ferrite during cooling (Ar3) and may 
involve rolling in the lower portion of the temperature range of 
the intercritical dual-phase region. 
Xl.2.2 Accelerated Cooling (AC)-Steels meeting the 
specified requirements are produced by controlled cooling 
(accelerated cooling and air cooling) through the dual-phase 
teq1perature region immediately after final controlled rolling 
(CR) or TMR operation, 
Xl.2.3 Direct Quenched and Tempered (DQT)-:-Steels 
meeting the specified requirements are produced by promoting 
grain refinement and increasing hardness through direct 
quenching i:tnmediately after final controlled rolling (CR) or 
TMR operations. Subsequent to direct quenching the plates are 
tempered. 
Xl.2.4 The selection, from the above, of the method to be 
used is made by the plate producer depending upon the 
chemical composition, the plate thickness, and the required 
properties.

processes, as follows: 
Xl.3.1 Thermo-Mechanical Rolling and Intermediately

as described in Xl.2.1, the plate may be tempered, except that 
prior to tempering after TMR, the plate may be subjected to an 
intermediate heat treatment consisting of heating to a tempera­
ture in the range from Ac 1 to Ac 3 · 
Xl.3.2 Direct Quenched and Tempered (DQ-T)-As de­
scribed in Xl.2.3. 
Xl.3.3 Direct Quenched and Intermediately Heat Treated 
and Tempered (DQ-I-T)-Similar to DQT, as described in 
Xl .2.3, except that prior to the tempering treatment and after 
DQ, the plate may be subjected to an intermediate heat 
treatment consisting of heating to a temperature in the range 
from Ac 1 to Ac3·

used is made by the plate producer depending upon the 
chemical composition, the plate thickness, and the required 
prope1ties.

INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Age-Hardening Alloy Steel Forgings for Pressure Vessel 
Components 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A859/A859M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
e 1 NOTE-MPa value was added in 1.2.2 editorially in April 2019. 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers requirements for low-carbon 
age-hardening nickel-copper-chromium-molybdenum­
columbium alloy steel forgings for pressure vessel compo­
nents. 
1.2 Forgings under this specification are available as Grades 
A or B. Grade A may be ordered in one or two classes as 
follows: 
1.2.1 Grade A Class J-Normalized-and-precipitation-heat­
treated, providing a minimum yield strength of 55 ksi 
[380 MPa] and a minimum tensile strength of 65 ksi 
[450 MPa]. 
1.2.2 Grade A Class 2-Quenched-and-precipitation-heat­
treated, providing a minimum yield strength of 65 ksi 
[450 MPa] and a minimum tensile strength of 75 ksi 
[515 MPa]. 
1.2.3 Grade A was the original steel composition in this 
specification. 
1.3 Although the material is readily weldable, welding 
procedures are of fundamental importance and must be such as 
not to affect adversely the properties of the material, especially 
in the heat-affected zone. It is presupposed that welding 
procedures will be suitable for the material being welded. 
1.4 Supplementary requirements, including those applicable 
in Specification A788/A788M, are provided for use when 
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply 
only when specified individually by the purchaser in the order. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined. 
1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, 
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee 
A0l.06 on Steel Forgings and Billets. 
Current edition approved March I, 2019. Published April 2019. Originally 
approved in 1986. Last previous edition approved in 2014 as A859/A859M---04 
(2014 ). DOI: 10.1520/ A0859 _A0859M---04Rl 9E01. 
1.6 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound and 
SI units. However, unless the order specifies the applicable 
"M" specification designation [SI units], the material shall be 
furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

6.3.1 Method I-This method shall always be used when 
the maximum as-heat-treated thickness does not exceed 2 in. 
[50 mm]. Specimens shall be located in the production forging 
or test forging (as described in Method 4) at mid-thickness and 
at least 2 in. [50 mm] from other as-heat-treated surfaces. 
6.3.2 Method 2-T by 2T, where Tis the distance from the 
area of significant loading (see 3.1) to the nearest as-heat­
treated surface. However, the specimen shall not be nearer to 
one as-heat-treated surface than¾ in. [20 mm] and not nearer 
than 1 ½ in. [40 mm] to a second as-heat-treated surface. When 
this method of testing is employed, forgings are usually 
manufactured in accordance with a purchaser-approved draw­
ing showing pre-heat-treatment dimensions and the location of 
test specimens. 
6.3.3 Method 3-¼ T by T, where T is the maximum 
thickness of the forging as-heat-treated. When this method of 
testing is employed for Class 2, the maximum as-heat-treated 
thickness shall not exceed 8 in. [200 mm] unless otherwise 
agreed. 
6.3.4 Method 4-Test specimens shall be taken from a 
representative separate test forging or bar made from the same 
heat of steel that shall receive substantially the same reduction 
and type of hot working as the production forgings which it 
represents; except that a longitudinally forged bar may be used 
to represent a rolled ring of similar cross section. It shall be of 
the same nominal thickness as the as-heat-treated production 
forgings and shall be heat treated in the same furnace charge 
and under the same conditions as the production forgings. Test 
specimens shall be removed using the ¼ T by T procedure 
referenced in Method 3 with the same limitation on forging 
thickness as in 6.3.3. This method shall be limited to forgings 
with a rough machined weight of not more than 1000 lb 
[500 kg]. 
6.4 Metal Buffers-The required distances from as-heat­
treated surfaces may be obtained with metal buffers instead of 
integral extensions. Buffer material may be carbon or low-alloy 
steel and shall be joined to the forging with a partial penetra­
tion weld that seals the buffered surface. Specimens shall be 
located at least ½ in. [13 mm] from the buffered surface of the 
forging. Buffers shall be removed and the welded areas 
subjected to magnetic particle test to ensure freedom from

subsequent machining. 
6.5 Samples shall be removed from forgings after heat 
treatment. The sample material shall be subjected to a simu­
lated post-weld heat-treatment if Supplementary Requirement 
S l is specified. 
6.6 Orientation-For upset disk forgings, the longitudinal 
axis of all test specimens shall be oriented in the tangential 
direction. For all other forgings, the longitudinal axis of the 
specimens shall be oriented in the direction of maximum 
working of the forging unless Supplementary Requirements 
S 11 or S 14 are imposed. 
6.7 Number of Tests: 
6.7.1 Forgings Under 500 lb [250 kg] As-Heat-Treated­
For duplicate forgings weighing less than 500 lb [250 kg] 
as-heat-treated, one tension test and one impact test (three 
specimens) shall be made to represent each heat in each 
heat-treatment charge. When heat-treatment is performed in 
continuous-type furnaces with suitable temperature control and 
equipped with recording pyrometers so that complete heat­
treatment records are available, a heat-treatment charge shall 
be considered as any continuous run not exceeding any 8 h 
duration. 
6.7.2 Forgings Weighing 500 to JO 000 lb [250 to 5000 kg] 
As-Heat-Treated-One tension and one impact test (three 
specimens) shall be made for each forging. 
6.7.3 Each forging weighing over 10 000 lb [5000 kg] shall 
require two tension tests and two impact tests, located at 
opposite ends if the length, excluding test prolongations, 
exceeds 80 in. [2000 mm], or located 180° apart for shorter 
length forgings. 
7. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
7 .1 The forgings shall conform to the dimensions specified 
by the purchaser. The finishes shall permit adequate visual 
inspection for surface imperfections. If a dimension varies 
from that specified, the forging may be offered to the purchaser 
for acceptance.

Resolved Notes (AI-verified)
NOTE 1 (page 1386)
NoTE 1-When the impact test criterion for a low-temperature service 
would be 15 ft,lbf [20 J] energy absorption or 15 mils [0.38 mm] lateral 
expansion, some of the austenitic stainless steel grades covered by this 
specification are accepted by certain pressure vessel or piping codes 
without the necessity of making the actual test. For example, Grades 304, 
304L, and 347 are accepted by the ASME Pressure Vessel Code, Section 
VIII Division 1, and by the Chemical Plant and Refinery Piping Code, 
ANSI 831.3 for service at temperatures as low as -425 °F [-250 °C] 
without qualification by impact tests. Other AISI stainless steel grades are 
usually accepted for service temperatures as low as -325 °F [-200 °C] 
without impact testing. Impact testing may, under certain circumstances, 
be required. For example, materials with chromium or nickel content 
outside the AISI ranges, and for material with carbon content exceeding 
0.10 %, are required to be impact tested under the rules of ASME Section 
VIII Division 1 when service temperatures are lower than -50 °F [-45 
oq, 
1.2 Grades TP304H, TP304N, TP316H, TP316N, TP321H, 
TP347H, and TP348H are modifications of Grades TP304, 
TP316, TP321, TP347, and TP348, and are intended for 
high-temperature service. 
1.3 Two classes of pipe are covered as follows: 
1.3.1 Class SW-Pipe, single-welded with no addition of 
filler metal and 
1.3.2 Class DW-Pipe, double-welded with no addition of 
filler metal. 
1.4 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for 
pipe where a greater degree of testing is desired. These 
supplementary requirements call for additional tests to be made 
and, when desired, one or more of these may be specified in the 
order. 
1.5 Table 1 lists the dimensions of cold-worked single- or 
double-welded stainless steel pipe. Pipe having other dimen-
sions may be furnished provided such pipe complies with all 
other requirements of this specification. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
