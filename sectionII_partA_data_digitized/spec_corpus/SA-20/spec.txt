ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-20/SA-20M 
1.5 Appendix X4 provides information on cold bending of 
plates, including suggested minimum inside radii for cold 
bending. 
1.6 These materials are intended to be suitable for fusion 
welding. When the steel is to be welded, it is presupposed that 
a welding procedure suitable for the grade of steel and intended 
use or service will be utilized. 
1.7 In case of any conflict in requirements, the requirements 
of the applicable product specification prevail over those of this 
general requirements specification. 
1.8 Additional requirements that are specified in the pur­
chase order and accepted by the supplier are permitted, 
provided that such requirements do not negate any of the 
requirements of this general requirements specification or the 
applicable product specification. 
1.9 For purposes of determining conformance with this 
general requirements specification and the applicable product 
specification, values are to be rounded to the nearest unit in the 
right-hand place of figures used in expressing the limiting 
values in accordance with the rounding method of Practice 
E29. 
1. 10 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.11 This general requirements specification and the appli­
cable product specification are expressed in both inch-pound 
units and SI units; unless the order specifies the applicable "M" 
specification designation (SI units), the plates are to be 
furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.12 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 as-rolled-for plates, the condition of a plate that has 
been hot-rolled and will not be or has not yet been heat treated. 
3.1.1.1 Discussion-The term as-rolled by itself is not 
meant to refer to plates that have been hot-rolled using control­
rolling (CR), direct quench (DQT), thermo-mechanical control 
rolling (TMCP), recrystalization control rolling (RCR), or any 
similar methods that ate intended to produce a set of properties 
that are not normally achievable were they not employed. The 
term as-rolled is to be distinguished from the established term 
70 
plate-as-rolled that does not define the actual condition of a 
plate, but defines the singular product of a slab or ingot that has 
been hot-rolled 
3.1.2 coil-hot-rolled steel in coil form for processing into 
finished plates. 
3.1.3 exclusive-when used in relation to ranges, as for 
ranges of thicknesses in the tables of permissible variations in 
dimensions, the term is intended to exclude only the greater 
value of the range. Thus, a range from 60 to 72 in. [1500 to 
1800 mm] exclusive includes 60 in. [1500 mm], but does not 
include 72 in. [1800 mm]. 
3.1.4 heat treatment terms-see 3.1.11, and Terminology 
A941. 
3.1.5 hot forming-a forming operation producing penna­
nent deformation, performed after the plate has been heated to 
the temperature required to produce grain refinement. 
3.1.6 hot-rolled (hot rolling)-for plates, the process de­
scribed for a plate that has been rolled from a slab or ingot 
whose starting temperature is suitably above the recrystalliza­
tion temperature of the metal to be rolled. 
3.1.6.1 Discussion-Hot-rolled may be used in conjunction 
with any rolling process to more effectively describe a specific 
condition, for example; hot-rolled as-rolled; hot-rolled control­
rolled, etc. 
3.1.7 manufacturer-the organization that directly controls 
the conversion of steel ingots or slabs, by hot rolling, into 
plate-as-rolled or into coil; and for plates produced from 
plate-as-rolled, the organization that directly controls, or is 
responsible for, one or more of the operations involved in 
finishing the plates. Such finishing operations include leveling, 
cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, heat treat­
ment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for shipment, 
and certification. 
3.1.7.1 Discussion-The finishing operations need not be 
done by the organization that did the hot rolling of the plate. 
For plates produced from coil, see also 3.1.2. 
3.1.8 mill edge-the normal edge produced by rolling be­
tween horizontal finishing rolls. A mill edge does not conform 
to any definite contour. Mill edge plates have two mill edges 
and two trimmed edges. 
3.1.8.1 Discussion-Mill edge plates may at times be side­
trimmed on one or both sides at the discretion of the manu­
facturer. 
3.1.9 plate identifier-the alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric 
designation used to identify the plate. 
3.1.10 plates-flat hot-rolled steel, ordered to thickness or 
weight and typically to width and length, commonly available 
by size as follows: 
Width, in. [mm] 
Over 8 [200] 
Over 48 [1200] 
Thickness, in. [mm] 
over 0.229 [6.0 mm and over] 
over 0.179 [4.6 mm and over] 
3.1.10.1 Discussion-Steel plates are available in various 
thickness, width, and length combinations dependent upon 
equipment and processing capabilities of various manufactur­
ers and processors. Historic limitations of a plate based upon 
dimensions (thickness, width, and length) do not take into

=== Page 123 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-20/SA-20M 
account current production and processing capabilities. To 
qualify any plate to a particular product specification requires 
that all appropriate and necessary tests be performed and that 
the results meet the limits prescribed in that product specifi­
cation. If the necessary tests required by a product specification 
can not be conducted, the plate can not be qualified to that 
specification. This general requirements specification contains 
permitted variations for the commonly available sizes. Permit­
ted variations for other sizes are subject to agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer or processor, whichever is 
applicable. 
3.1.11 precipitation heat treatment-a subcritical tempera­
ture thermal treatment performed to cause precipitation of 
submicroscopic constituents, and so forth, to result in enhance­
ment of some desirable property. 
3.1.12 processor-the organization that directly controls, or 
is responsible for, operations involved in the processing of coil 
into finished plates. Such processing operations include 
decoiling, leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, 
conditioning, heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, 
marking, loading for shipment, and certification. 
3.1.12.1 Discussion-The processing operations need not be 
done by the organization that did the hot rolling of the coil. If 
only one organization is involved in the hot rolling and 
processing operations, that organization is termed the manu­
facturer for the hot rolling operation and the processor for the 
processing operations. If more than one organization is in­
volved in the hot rolling and processing operations, the 
organization that did the hot rolling is termed the manufacturer 
and the organization that does one or more processing opera­
tions is termed a processor. 
3.2 Refer to Terminology A941 for additional terms used in 
this standard. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 Orders should include the following information, as 
necessary, to adequately describe the desired product.

in a ladle metallurgy furnace (LMF), or by another method; or 
secondary melting by vacuum-arc remelting (VAR), electro­
slag remelting (ESR), or another method. 
5.2 The steel may be strand cast or cast in stationary molds. 
5.2.1 Strand Cast Slabs: 
5.2.1.1 If heats of the same nominal chemical composition 
are consecutively strand cast at one time, the heat number 
assigned to the cast product (slab) may remain unchanged until 
all of the steel in the slab is from the following heat. 
5.2.1.2 When two consecutively strand cast heats have 
different nominal chemical composition ranges, the manufac­
turer shall remove the transition material by any established 
procedure that positively separates the grades. 
5.3 The ratio of reduction of thickness from a strand-cast 
slab to plate shall be at least 3.0:1, except that reduction ratios 
as low as 2.0: 1 are permitted if all of the following limitations 
are met: 
5.3.1 The purchaser agrees to the use of such reduction 
ratios.

analysis. 
5.3.6 One or more of the following practices are used: 
electromagnetic stirring during strand casting; soft reduction 
during strand casting; heavy pass reductions or other special 
practices during plate rolling; or combined forging and rolling 
during plate rolling. 
5.3.7 The plates are ultrasonically examined in accordance 
with Specification A578/A578M, Level C based on continuous 
scanning over 100 % of the plate surface. 
5.3.8 The plates are through-thickness tension tested in 
accordance with Specification A770/A770M. 
5.4 Unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, plates 
shall be produced from plate-as-rolled or from coil. 
5.5 Coils are excluded from qualification to the applicable 
product specification until they are decoiled, leveled, cut to 
length, and tested by the processor in accordance with the 
specified requirements (see Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 
16, and 20.)

SA-20/SA-20M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
5.5.1 Plates produced from coil shall not contain splice 
welds, unless approved by the purchaser. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 If plates are required to be heat treated, the heat 
treatment shall be performed by the manufacturer, the 
processor, or the fabricator, unless otherwise specified in the 
applicable product specification. 
6.2 If the heat treatment required by the applicable product 
specification is to be performed by the purchaser or the 
purchaser's agent, and the plates are to be supplied by the 
manufacturer or processor in a condition other than that 
required by the applicable product specification, the order shall 
so state. 
6.2.1 If plates are ordered without the heat treatment re­
quired by the applicable product specification, heat treatment 
of the plates to confonn to the requirements of the applicable 
product specification shall be the responsibility of the pur­
chaser. 
6.3 If heat treatment is to be performed, the plates shall be 
heat treated as specified in the applicable product specification. 
The purchaser may specify the heat treatment to be used, 
provided it is not in conflict with the requirements of the 
applicable product specification. 
6.4 If normalizing is to be performed by the fabricator, the 
plates shall be either normalized or heated uniformly for hot 
forming, provided that the temperature to which the plates are 
heated for hot forming does not significantly exceed the 
normalizing temperature, 
6.5 If no heat treatment is required, the manufacturer or 
processor shall have the option of heat treating the plates by 
normalizing, stress relieving, or normalizing and then stress 
relieving to meet the requirements of the applicable product 
specification. 
6.6 If approved by the purchaser, cooling rates faster than 
those obtained by cooling in air are permissible to achieve 
specified mechanical properties, provided that the plates are 
subsequently tempered in the temperature range from 1100 to

for the applicable grade, class, and type, product analyses shall 
conform to the applicable product analysis limits given in 
Table 1. 
7.3 Referee Analysis-For referee purposes, Test Methods, 
Practices, and Terminology A751 shall be used. 
8. Metallurgical Structure 
8.1 Where austenitic grain size testing is required, such 
testing shall be a McQuaid Ehn test in accordance with Test 
Methods El12 and at least 70 % of the grains in the area 
examined shall meet the specified grain size requirement. 
8.2 Coarse Austenitic Grain Size-Where coarse austenitic 
grain size is specified one austenitic grain size test per heat 
shall be made and the grain size number so determined shall be 
in the range of 1 to 5 inclusive. 
8.3 Fine Austenitic Grain Size: 
8.3.1 Except as allowed in 8.3.2, and when fine austenitic 
grain size is specified, or when the producer elects to determine 
the grain size, one McQuaid Ehn test per heat shall be made 
and the austenitic grain size number so determined shall be 5 
or higher, and the chemical requirements of 8.3.2 do not apply. 
NoTE 1-Such austenitic grain size numbers may be achieved with 
lower contents of austenitic grain refining elements than 8.3.2 requires for 
austenitic grain size testing to be waived. 
8.3.2 Unless testing for fine austenitic grain size is specified 
in the purchase order or the producer elects to test for fine 
austenitic grain size, the austenitic grain size test need not be 
made for any heat that has, by heat analysis, one or more of the 
following: 
8.3.2.1 A total aluminum content of 0.020 % or more. 
8.3.2.2 An acid soluble aluminum content of 0.015 % or 
more. 
8.3.2.3 A content for an austenitic grain refining element 
that exceeds the minimum value agreed to by the purchaser as 
being sufficient for austenitic grain size testing to be waived. 
8.3.2.4 Contents for the combination of two or more auste­
nitic grain refining elements that exceed the applicable mini­
mum values agreed to by the purchaser as being sufficient for 
austenitic grain size testing to be waived. 
8.3.2.5 The analysis for the elements mentioned in 8.3.2.1, 
8.3.2.2, 8.3.2.3, or 8.3.2.4 shall be included in the test report. 
9. Quality 
9.1 General-Plates shall be free of injurious defects and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. 
9.2 Surface Impeifections: 
9.2.1 For plates produced from plate-as-rolled, all injurious 
surface imperfections shall be removed by the manufacturer. 
For plates produced from coil, all injurious surface imperfec­
tions shall be removed by the processor. 
9.2.1.1 Shallow imperfections shall be ground to sound 
metal; the ground area shall be well faired and the thickness of 
the ground plate shall not be reduced below the minimum 
thickness permitted. 
9 .2.1.2 All surface imperfections, the removal of which will 
reduce the plate thickness below the minimum thickness 
permitted, shall be cause for rejection of the plate, except that, 
73 
by agreement with the purchaser, the metal so removed may be 
replaced with weld metal (see 9.4). 
9.3 Edge Impeifections: 
9.3.1 Laminar-type discontinuities 1 in. [25 mm] and less in 
length visible to the unaided eye on an edge of a plate as 
prepared for shipment by the manufacturer or processor are 
acceptable and do not require exploration. 
9.3.2 All larger discontinuities shall be explored to deter­
mine their depth and extent. Discontinuities shall be considered 
continuous when located in the same plane within 5 % of the 
plate thickness and separated by a distance less than the length 
of the smaller of two adjacent discontinuities. 
9.3.3 Indications visible to the unaided eye on the cut edges 
of a plate as prepared for shipment by the manufacturer or 
processor shall not exceed the limits given in Columns 1 and 2 
of Table Al.14 [A2.14]. 
9.3.4 Larger indications shall be removed by the manufac­
turer or processor by grinding, provided that the resultant 
cavity does not exceed the limits given in Columns 3 and 4 of 
Table Al.14 [A2.14]. 
9.3.5 Indications of greater magnitude shall be cause for 
rejection of the plate, except that, by agreement with the 
purchaser, the defects may be removed and replaced with weld 
metal (see 9.4). 
9.3.6 Indications on the edges of a plate cut during the 
fabrication shall be cause for rejection of the plate at the 
discretion of the purchaser if the magnitude exceeds the limits 
given in Columns 5 and 6 of Table Al .14 [ A2. l 4]. The defects 
may be removed and replaced with weld metal (see 9.4). 
9.3.7 Fabricators should be aware that edge cracks may 
initiate upon bending a sheared or burned edge during the 
fabrication process. This is not considered to be a fault of the 
steel, but is rather a function of the induced cold work or heat 
affected zone. 
9.4 Repair by Welding: 
9.4.1 Repair welding shall be permitted only with the 
approval of the purchaser. 
9.4.2 Preparation for repair welding shall include inspection 
to confirm complete removal of the defect. 
9.4.3 Repairs shall be made utilizing welding procedures 
qualified in accordance with Section IX of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and repair welding 
shall be done by welders or welding operators meeting the 
qualification requirements of Section IX. 
9.4.4 The weld metal shall have the A-number analysis 
corresponding to the equivalent ASME P-number of the plate, 
except that A-1 or A-2 analysis weld metal may be employed 
for P-1 plates. Other weld metals may be employed that are 
compatible with the plate being repaired, if so approved by the 
purchaser. Such weld metals shall be qualified in accordance 
with the requirements of Section IX of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
9.4.5 If Charpy impact tests of the plate are required, the 
welding procedure qualification tests shall also include Charpy 
impact tests of the weld, the heat-affected zone, and the plate, 
and the test results shall be reported to the purchaser. 
9 .4.6 If the plate is subjected to normalizing, quenching and 
tempering, hot forming, or post-weld heat treating, the welding

=== Page 126 ===

SA-20/SA-Z0M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
procedure qualification test plates and the weld repaired plate 
shall be subjected to the thermal heat treatment as specified by 
the purchaser. 
9.4.7 In addition, repair welds shall meet the requirements 
of the construction code specified by the purchaser. 
10. Test Methods 
10.1 All tests shall be conducted in accordance with Test 
Methods and Definitions A370. 
10.2 Yield strength shall be determined by either the 0.2 % 
offset method or the 0.5 % extension under load method, unless 
otherwise stated in the applicable product specification. 
10.3 Rounding Procedures-For purposes of determining 
conformance with the applicable product specification, a cal­
culated value shall be rounded to the nearest 1 ksi [5 MPa] for 
tensile and yield strengths, and to the nearest unit in the 
right-hand place of figures used in expressing the limiting 
value for other values, in accordance with the rounding method 
given in Practice E29. 
11. Tension Tests 
11.1 Number of Test Coupons: 
11.1.1 Plates Produced from As-Rolled Plates-For other 
than quenched and tempered plates, one tension test coupon 
shall be taken from each plate-as-rolled. Two tension test 
coupons shall be taken from each quenched and tempered 
plate, as heat treated. If plates are furnished by the manufac­
turer or processor in accordance with 11.4.2 and qualified by 
using test specimens taken from heat-treated test coupons 
(including normalized, normalized and tempered, and 
quenched and tempered), one tension test coupon shall be 
taken from each plate-as-rolled (see Terminology A941 for the 
definition of plate-as-rolled). 
11.1.2 Plates Produced from Coil and Furnished without 
Heat Treatment or with Stress Relieving Only-Except as 
allowed by 11.1.2.1 and 11.1.4, a minimum of three tension 
coupons shall be taken from each coil as follows: 
11.1.2. l The first test coupon shall be taken immediately 
prior to the first plate to be qualified to the applicable product 
specification, the second test coupon shall be taken from the 
approximate center lap, and the third test coupon shall be taken 
immediately after the last plate to be qualified to the applicable 
product specification. If, during decoiling, the amount of 
material decoiled is less than that required to reach the next 
standard test location, a test for qualification of that particular 
portion of the coil shall be made from a test coupon taken from 
a location adjacent to the innermost portion decoiled. 
11.1.2.2 All plates between any two test locations that meet 
the requirements of the applicable product specification are 
acceptable. 
11. l.2.3 All plates between a test location that fails to meet 
the requirements of the applicable product specification and an 
adjacent test location that meets the requirements of the 
applicable product specification are rejectable, except that the 
processor has the option to malce other tests after cutting back 
the coil in either direction. 
11.1.3 Plates Produced from Coil and Furnished Heat 
Treated by Other than Stress Relieving-For other than 
74 
quenched and tempered plates, one tension test coupon shall be 
taken from each coil. Two tension test coupons shall be taken 
from each quenched and tempered plate, as heat treated. 
11.1.4 Plates Produced from Coil and Qualified Using Test 
Specimens Taken from Test Coupons Heat Treated by Other 
than Stress Relieving-One tension test coupon shall be taken 
from each coil. 
11.2 Orientation of Test Specimens-The longitudinal axis 
of the tension test specimens shall be transverse to the final 
rolling direction of the plate. 
11.3 Location of Test Coupons-Tension test coupons shall 
be taken from a corner of the plate. For quenched and tempered 
plates, the two tension test coupons shall be taken from 
opposite ends of the plate. 
11.4 Tests from Heat-Treated Plates: 
11.4.1 If heat treatment is performed by the manufacturer or 
processor, the test specimens shall be taken from the plate in 
the heat-treated condition or from full-thickness coupons 
simultaneously heat treated with the plate. 
11.4.2 If heat treatment is to be performed by the fabricator, 
the plates shall be accepted on the basis of tests made on test 
specimens taken from full-thickness coupons heat treated in 
accordance with the requirements specified in the applicable 
product specification or the purchase order. If the heat­
treatment temperatures are not specified, the manufacturer or 
processor shall heat treat the coupons under conditions it 
considers appropriate. The purchaser shall be informed of the 
procedure followed in heat treating the specimens. 
11.4.3 If approved by the purchaser, the procedures of 
11.4.2 may be implemented on plates heat treated by the 
manufacturer or processor, except that for plates that are 
quenched and tempered, all testing required the specification or 
the purchase order must be performed after plate heat 
treatment, in accordance with 11.1.1 and 11.4.4, and the results 
reported. 
11.4.4 For plates that are heat treated with a cooling rate 
faster than still-air cooling from the austenitizing temperature, 
one of the following shall apply in addition to other require­
ments specified herein: 
11.4.4.1 The gage length of the tension test specimen shall 
be talcen at least IT from any as-heat treated edge, where Tis 
the thickness of the plate, and shall be at least ½ in. [12.5 mm] 
from flame-cut or heat-affected-zone surfaces. 
11.4.4.2 A steel thermal buffer pad, 1 Tby lTby at least 3T, 
shall be joined to the plate edge by a partial penetration weld 
completely sealing the buffered edge prior to heat treatment. 
11.4.4.3 Thermal insulation or other thermal barriers shall 
be used during the heat treatment adjacent to the plate edge 
where the test specimens are to be removed. It shall be 
demonstrated that the cooling rate of the tension test specimen 
is no faster than, and not substantially slower than, that attained 
by the method described in 11.4.4.2. 
11 .4.4.4 When test coupons cut from the plate but heat 
treated separately are used, the coupon dimensions shall be not 
less than 3T by 3T by T and each tension test specimen cut 
from it shall meet the requirements of 11.4.4.1.

=== Page 127 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-20/SA-Z0M 
11.4.4.5 If cooling rate data for the plate and cooling rate 
control devices for the test coupons are available, the test 
coupons may be heat treated separately in the device, provided 
that this method is approved by the purchaser. 
11.5 Test Specimen Preparation: 
11.5.1 Tension test specimens for plates¾ in. [20 mm] and 
under in thickness shall be the full thickness of the plates. The 
test specimens shall conform to the requirements for either the 
1 ½-in. [ 40-mm] wide or the ½-in. [12.5-mm] wide rectangular 
tension test specimen of Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
The 1 ½-in. [ 40-mm] wide test specimen may have both edges 
parallel. The ½-in. [12.5-mm] wide specimen may have a 
maximum nominal thickness of¾ in. [20 mm]. 
11.5.2 For plates up to 4 in. [100 mm], inclusive, in 
thickness, tension test specimens may be the full thickness of 
the plate and conform to the requirements for the 1 ½-in. 
[ 40-mm] wide rectangular tension test specimen of Test Meth­
ods and Definitions A370 if adequate testing machine capacity 
is available. 
11.5.3 For plates over¾ in. [20 mm] in thickness, except as 
permitted in 11.5.2, tension test specimens shall conform to the 
requirements for the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] diameter test speci­
men of Test Methods and Definitions A370. For plates between 
3/4 in. [20 mm] and 1-1/2 in. [40 mm] inclusive in thickness, the 
axis of the test specimen shall be located at 1/2 T, the center of 
the thickness. For plates over 1-1/2 in. [40 mm], the axis of the 
test specimen shall be located at l/4T, midway between the center 
of the thickness and the top or the bottom surface of the plate. 
11.6 Elongation Requirement Adjustments: 
11.6.1 Due to the specimen geometry effect encountered 
when using the rectangular tension test specimen for testing 
thin plate, adjustments in elongation requirements must be 
provided for thicknesses under 0.312 in. [8 mm]. Accordingly, 
the following deductions shall be made from the base elonga­
tion requirements in the applicable product specification: 
Elongation 
Deduction,% Plate Nominal Thickness Range, in. [mm] 
0.299-0.311 [7.60-7.89] 0.5 
0.286-0.298 [7.30-7.59] 1.0 
0.273-0.285 [7.00-7.29] 1.5 
0.259-0.272 [6.60-6.99] 2.0 
0.246-0.258 [6.20-6.59] 2.5 
0.233-D.245 [5.90-6.19] 3.0 
0.219-0.232 [5.50-5.89] 3.5 
0.206-0.218 [5.20-5.49] 4.0 
0.193-0.205 [4.90-5.19] 4.5 
less than 0.193 [4.90] 5.0 
11.6.2 Due to the inherently lower elongation that is obtain­
able in thicker plate, adjustments in elongation requirements in 
2-in. [50-mm] gage length shall be provided for thicknesses 
over 3.5 in. [90 mm]. Accordingly, the following deductions 
shall be made from the base elongation requirements in 2 in. 
[50 mm] prescribed in the applicable product specification: 
Elongation 
Deduction, % Plate Nominal Thickness Range, in. [mm] 
3.501-3.999 [90.00-102.49] 0.5 
4.000-4.499 [102.50-114.99] 1.0 
4.500-4.999 [115.00-127.49] 1.5 
5.000-5.499 [127.50-139.99] 2.0 
5.500-5.999 [140.0-152.49] 2.5 
6.000 and thicker [152.50 and thicker] 3.0 
11.6.3 A characteristic of certain types of alloy steels is a 
local disproportionate increase in the degree of necking down 
or contraction of the test specimens during the tension test, 
resulting in a decrease in the percentage of elongation as the 
75 
gage length is increased. The effect is not so pronounced in 
thicker plates. For such material, if so stated in the applicable 
product specification for plates up to¾ in. [20 mm], inclusive, 
in thickness, if the percentage of elongation of an 8-in. 
[200-mm] gage length test specimen falls not more than 3 
percentage points below the amount prescribed, the elongation 
shall be considered satisfactory if the percentage of elongation 
in 2 in. [50 mm] across the break is not less than 25 %. 
11.6.4 The tensile requirements tables in many of the 
product specifications covered by this general requirements 
specification specify elongation requirements in both 8-in. 
[200-mm] and 2-in. [50-mm] gage lengths. Unless otherwise 
provided in the applicable product specification, both require­
ments are not required to be applied simultaneously, and the 
elongation need only be determined in the gage length appro­
priate for the test specimen used. After selection of the 
appropriate gage length, the elongation requirement for the 
alternative gage length shall be deemed not applicable. 
11. 7 This specification does not provide requirements for 
product tension testing subsequent to shipment (see 15.1). 
Therefore, the requirements of 11.1 through 11.6 and Section 
16 apply only for tests conducted at the place of manufacture 
prior to shipment. Compliance to Specification A20/20M and 
the applicable product specification does not preclude the 
possibility that product tension test results may vary outside 
specified ranges. The tensile properties will vary within the 
same plate-as-rolled or piece, be it as-rolled, control-rolled, or 
heat-treated. The purchaser should, therefore, be aware that 
tension testing in accordance with the requirements of Speci­
fication A20/ A20M does not provide assurance that all prod­
ucts of a plate-as-rolled will be identical in tensile properties 
with the products tested; If the purchaser wishes to have more 
confidence than that provided by Specification A20/ A20M 
testing procedures, additional testing or requirements, such as 
Supplementary Requirement S4, should be imposed. 
11.8 Appendix X2 provides additional information on the 
variability of tensile properties in plates for pressure vessels. 
12. Notch-Toughness Tests 
12.1 Charpy V-Notch Tests: 
12.1.1 Number of Tests-If Charpy V-Notch tests are 
specified, except for quenched and tempered plates, and except 
as allowed by 12.1.1.1 and 12.1.1.2, one impact test (3 
specimens) for each specified orientation (see 12.1.2) shall be 
made from each plate-as-rolled. For quenched and tempered 
plates, one impact test shall be made from each plate, as heat 
treated. 
12.1.1.1 Plates Ordered Without the Heat Treatment Speci­
fied by the Applicable Product Specification-Coupons for 
Charpy V-notch tests shall be taken in accordance with the 
same requirements as given for tensile test coupons in 11.4.2 
and 11.4.3. 
12.1.1.2 Plates Produced from Coil-If Charpy V-notch 
tests are specified, the number of impact tests required shall be 
the same as the number specified for tension tests in 11.1.2 or 
11.1.3, whichever is applicable. The test coupons shall be taken 
from the material after decoiling and leveling.

=== Page 128 ===

SA-20/SA-Z0M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
12.1.2 Orientation of Test Specimens-The long axis of the 
test specimens shall be oriented either longitudinal (parallel to 
the final direction of rolling) or transverse (transverse to the 
final direction of rolling), as specified in the applicable product 
specification or the purchase order. 
12.1.3 Location of Test Coupons-The impact test coupons 
shall be taken adjacent to the tension test coupons. The impact 
test coupons shall be subject to the same requirements as those 
specified for tension tests in 11.4, except that the provisions of 
11.4.4.1 apply to the area under the notch of the impact test 
specimen instead of to the gage length of the tension test 
specimen. 
12.1.4 Test Method-Impact testing shall be performed in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370 using 
Charpy V-notch (Type A) specimens as shown in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370. Except as allowed by 12.1.4.1, full-size 
specimens (0.394 by 0.394 in. [10 by 10 mm]) shall be used if 
the plate thickness permits, and their central axis shall corre­
spond as near as practical to the ¼ t plane in the plate thickness 
t. If the plate thickness is insufficient to obtain full-size 
specimens, the largest possible subsize specimens shall be 
used. 
12.1.4.1 For plates that normally have absorbed energy 
values in excess of 180 ft-lbf [245 J] if tested using full-size 
specimens at the specified testing temperature, subsize 0.394 
by 0.264 in. [10 by 6.7 mm] specimens may be used in lieu of 
full-size specimens; however, if this option is used, the 
acceptance value shall be 75 ft-lbf [100 J] minimum for each 
test specimen and the lateral expansion in mils [micrometres] 
shall be reported. 
12.1.5 Test Temperature-The test temperature shall be as 
specified by the product specification, if applicable, or by the 
purchaser, except that the manufacturer or processor shall have 
the option of using a lower test temperature. The actual test 
temperature used shall be reported with the test results. 
12.1.6 Acceptance Criteria-The acceptance criteria shall 
be as specified by the product specification, if applicable, or the 
purchaser. 
12.1.6.1 If the acceptance criteria is based upon energy 
absorption of a full-size specimen, the acceptance criteria for 
the various subsize specimens shall be as given in TableAl.16 
[A2.16], except as otherwise provided in 12.1.4.1. 
12.1.6.2 If the acceptance criterion is based upon lateral 
expansion opposite the notch, the acceptance value shall be the 
same for all sizes of test specimens. 
12.1.7 Marking-The letters "LTV" shall be stenciled or 
stamped on each plate following the class number, grade, etc. 
12.1.8 Variability-The impact properties of steel can vary 
within the same plate-as-rolled or piece, be it as-rolled, 
control-rolled, or heat-treated. The purchaser should, therefore, 
be aware that testing of one plate-as-rolled does not provide 
assurance that all locations within a plate-as-rolled will be 
identical in toughness with the location tested. Normalizing or 
quenching and tempering the product will reduce the degree of 
variation. 
12.1.8.1 Appendix X3 provides additional information on 
the variability of Charpy V-notch test properties in plates for 
pressure vessels. 
76 
12.2 Drop-Weight Tests: 
12.2.1 Where specified, one drop-weight test, consisting of 
a set of two test specimens, shall be made to the same 
frequency stated in 12.1.1 in accordance with Test Method 
E208. 
12.2.2 The test coupons shall be obtained adjacent to a 
tension test coupon. For plates produced from coil, the test 
coupon locations shall be the same as for Charpy V-notch tests. 
(See 12.1.) The provisions of 12.1.3 shall also apply. 
12.2.3 The testing temperature shall be as specified in the 
applicable product specification or the purchase order. 
12.2.4 Acceptance shall be on the basis of no-break perfor­
mance of both test specimens at the specified testing tempera­
ture. 
12.2.5 The plates shall be marked as required in 12.1.7, 
except that the letters "LTD" shall be used instead of "LTV." 
13. Identification of Plates 
13.1 Required Markings: 
13.1.1 Except as allowed by 13.4, plates shall be legibly 
marked with the following information: applicable ASTM 
designation (see 1.1) (year of issue not required); "G" or" MT" 
if applicable (see 13.1.2); applicable grade, type, and class; 
heat number; plate identifier; and name, brand, or trademark of 
the manufacturer (for plates produced in discrete cut lengths of 
flat product) or the processor (for plates produced from coil and 
for subdivided plates (see 13.4)). 
13.1.2 Plates that are required to be heat treated, but have 
not been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the manufacturer 
or processor, with the letter "G" ( denoting green) following the 
required ASTM designation mark, except that "G" marking is 
not necessary if such plates are for shipment, for the purpose of 
obtaining the required heat treatment, to an organization under 
the manufacturer's control. Plates that are required to be heat 
treated, and have been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the 
party that performed the heat treatment, with the letters "MT" 
( denoting material treated) following the required ASTM 
designation mark. 
Norn 2-Any stress relief of test specimens intended to simulate 
post-weld heat treatment is not included in the above heat treatment. 
13.2 Types of Marking: 
13.2.1 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates over ¼ in. [6 mm] in thickness shall be by steel die 
stamping, unless paint marking is specified in the purchase 
order. 
13.2.2 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates ¼ in. [6 mm] and under in thickness shall be by paint 
marking or by steel die stamping using low-stress (either 
round-nose or interrupted-dot) impressions. 
13.3 Location of Markings: 
13.3.1 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates with a maximum lengthwise or crosswise dimension 
more than 72 in. [1800 mm] shall be in at least two places on 
each finished plate, at least 12 in. [300 mm] from the edges of 
the plate. 
13.3.2 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates with a maximum lengthwise and crosswise dimension of

=== Page 129 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-20/SA-ZOM 
72 in. [1800 mm] or less shall be in at least one place on each 
finished plate, approximately midway between the center and 
an edge of the plate. 
13.4 Subdivided Plates: 
13.4.1 By agreement between the purchaser and the manu­
facturer or processor, each subdivided plate (a plate separated 
from a master plate) shall be legibly marked with the name, 
brand, or trademark of the organization that subdivided the 
plate plus a code traceable to the required markings, provided 
that the information required in 13.1, cross referenced to that 
code, is furnished with the plates. 
13.4.2 By agreement between the purchaser and the manu­
facturer or processor, subdivided plates that are from the same 
master plate and placed in secured lifts shall have the infor­
mation required in 13.1 paint marked on the top piece of each 
lift or shown on a substantial tag attached to each lift. 
13.5 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements of 13.1 to 
13.4 inclusive, the manufacturer or processor shall have the 
option of using bar coding as a supplementary identification 
method. 
Norn 3-Bar coding should be consistent with AIAG Standard B 1. 
14. Permissible Variations in Dimensions or Mass 
14.1 One cubic foot of rolled steel shall be assumed to 
weigh 490 lb, unless otherwise stated in the applicable product 
specification. One cubic metre of rolled steel is assumed to 
have a mass of 7850 kg, unless otherwise stated in the 
applicable product specification. 
14.2 For carbon steel plates the permissible variations for 
dimensions shall not exceed the applicable limits stated in 
Annex Al, Table Al.I to Table Al.9, and Table Al.13 [Annex 
A2, Table A2.1 to Table A2.9, and Table A2.13]. 
14.3 For alloy steel plates the permissible variations for 
dimensions shall not exceed the applicable limits stated in 
Annex 1, Table Al.I to Table Al.4, Table Al.8, and Table 
Al.IO to Table Al.13 [Annex 2, Table A2.l to Table A2.4,

14.4 Permitted vaiiations on length and width for plates 
supplied on other than strip mills as mill edge shall be at the 
discretion of the manufacturer unless otherwise agreed to with 
the purchaser. For mill edge carbon steel, high-strength low­
alloy, and alloy plates produced on strip mills, the permitted 
variation in width shall not exceed the applicable limit stated in 
Table Al.17 [A2.16]. For mill edge carbon steel, high-strength 
low-alloy, and alloy plates produced on mill other than strip 
mills the permitted variation in width stated in Table Al.17 
[A2.16] may be specified only upon agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. Mill edge plates as delivered 
shall be capable of being trimmed by the purchaser to the 
required final rectangular size ordered. 
14.5 Conversions of Permitted Variations from Fractions of 
an Inch to Decimals-Pennitted variations in dimensions for 
products covered by this specification are generally given as 
fractions of inch and these remain the official permitted 
variations, where so stated. If the material is to be measured by 
equipment reporting dimensions as decimals, conversion of 
77 
permitted variations from fractions of an inch to decimals shall 
be made to three decimal places; using the rounding method 
prescribed in Practice E29. 
15. Inspection and Testing 
15.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry at all times while work on the contract of the purchaser 
is being pe1formed, to all parts of the manufacturer's works 
that concern the manufacture of the plate ordered. The manu­
facturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities to be 
satisfied that the plate is being furnished in accordance with 
this general requirements specification, the applicable product 
specification, and the purchase order. All tests (except product 
analysis) and inspection shall be made at the place of manu­
facture prior to shipment, unless otherwise specified, and shall 
be so conducted as not to inte1fere unnecessarily with the 
operation of the manufacturer's works. 
15.2 If plates are produced from coil, 15.1 shall apply to the 
"processor" instead of to the "manufacturer" and the "place of 
process" shall apply instead of the "place of manufacture." If 
plates are produced from coil and the processor is different 
from the manufacturer, the inspector representing the purchaser 
shall have free entry, at all times while work on the contract of 
the purchaser is being performed, to all parts of the manufac­
turer's works that concern the manufacture of the plate 
ordered. 
16. Retests 
16.1 Tension Test-In addition to the prov1s1ons of Test 
Methods and Definitions A370, the following retest provisions 
shall apply: 
16.1.1 If any test specimen shows defective machining, or 
develops flaws, it may be discarded and another test specimen 
substituted. 
16.1.2 If the percentage of elongation of any tension test 
specimen is less than that specified, and any part of the fracture 
is more than ¾ in. [20 mm] from the center of the gage length 
of a 2-in. [50-mm] test specimen or is outside the middle half 
of the gage length of an 8-in. [200-mm] test specimen as 
indicated by scribe marks on the test specimen before testing, 
one retest shall be allowed. 
16.1.3 If the results from an original tension test specimen 
fail to meet the specified requirements but are within 2 ksi [10 
MPa] of the required tensile strength or within 1 ksi [5 MPa] 
of the required yield strength or yield point, or within 2 
percentage points of the required elongation or reduction of 
area, one retest shall be pennitted to replace the failing test. 
16.1.4 The results of the retest shall meet the specified 
requirements. 
16.2 Charpy V-Notch Tests: 
16.2.1 The retest provisions of Test Methods and Defini­
tions A370 shall apply, except that the 5 ft·lbf [7 J] absolute 
minimum for an individual specimen shall not apply if two 
thirds of the specified minimum average is less than 5 ft-lbf [7 
J]. 
16.2.2 If Charpy V-notch impact test lateral expansion 
values are specified, if the value of one specimen falls below 
the specified minimum value and not below 2/3 of the specified

=== Page 130 ===

SA-20/SA-Z0M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
minimum value, and if the average of the three specimens 
equals or exceeds the specified minimum value, a retest of 
three additional specimens may be made. Each of the three 
retest specimens shall equal or exceed the specified minimum 
value. 
16.2.3 If the required values are not obtained on Charpy 
V-notch retests as specified in 16.2.1 and 16.2.2, or if the 
values in the initial test are below the values required for retest, 
no further retests are permitted unless the plate is heat treated 
or reheat treated. After heat treatment or reheat treatment, a set 
of three specimens shall be tested and each shall equal or 
exceed the specified minimum value. 
16.2.4 If the option of 12.1.4.1 is used and the test result 
falls below the 7 5 ft- lbf [ 100 J] minimum specified, another test 
may be made using full-size test specimens. 
17. Retreatment 
17 .1 If any heat-treated plate fails to meet the mechanical 
requirements of the applicable product specification, the manu­
facturer or processor shall have have the option of heat treating 
the plate again. All mechanical-property tests shall be repeated 
and the plate surface shall be reexamined for surface defects 
when it is resubmitted for inspection.

A3. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW MATERIALS 
A3.l Proposals for the introduction of new plate materials 
to be covered by the general requirements in this specification, 
either by the addition of new grades within existing 
specifications, or by the creation of a new specification shall be 
subject to the following conditions: 
A3.l.1 The application for the addition of a new grade to a 
specification or a new specification shall be made to the chair 
of the subcommittee. Applications for new specifications 
remain subject to the approval of Committee A0l. Revisions to 
existing specifications for such reasons as chemistry or thick­
ness limitation are not subject to this annex. 
A3.l.2 The application shall contain documentation citing 
the requisite need for the new material and its intended use as 
outlined in Form and Style for ASTM Standards, BS. Scope.3 
That documentation may be in the form of a letter from a user, 
fabricator, another standards development organization, or 
producer stating the purpose and intended use for said new 
mate1ial. The Subcommittee may consider other evidence of 
need for the proposal. Additional background information as 
may be pertinent to the introduction of tlie new material may 
also be presented with the proposal. 
A3.l.3 The application shall be accompanied by test data as 
required by the applicable specification. Test data from a 
minimum of three test lots, as defined by the specification, each 
from a different heat, shall be furnished and shall include: 
A3.l.3.l Chemical data reflecting a suitable representation 
of tlie required chemistry range requested. 
A3.l.3.2 Mechanical property data representing the pro­
posed requirements in the delivered condition from each of the 
heats supplied. 
NoTE A3. l-To assist the balloting process, data from plates represent­
ing the maximum proposed thickness should be provided recognizing that 
in some cases the standard may be "limited only by the capacity of the 
composition to meet the specified mechanical property requirements." 
A3.l.3.3 Mechanical property data in the simulated Post­
Weld Heat Treatment (PWHT) condition if the product speci­
fication lists Supplementary Requirement S3. 
A3.l.3.4 Evidence of weldability if the material is intended 
for welded construction as may be referenced in the Scope 
section of the new or existing standard. 
NoTE A3.2-Such evidence is at the discretion of the submitter. 
Common methodology may include but not be limited to a single ASME 
Section IX qualification such as is referenced in 9 .4 of this specification. 
A3.l.4 Other properties that are not specification require­
ments that further describe the material, including physical 
properties, are not mandatory. However, to the extent that such 
information may assist the Subcommittee in evaluating the 
proposal they may be included. Omission of such non-essential 
documentation shall not be a cause for rejection of the 
application by the subcommittee. 
A3.l.5 The application shall state whether or not a patent 
covers ilie new material. 
APPENDIXES 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. COILED STEEL 
Xl.1 Continuous wide hot strip rolling mills are nonnally 
equipped with coilers. Regardless of the different types of 
systems employed during or following the rolling operations, it 
is common for the steel to be reeled into the coiler at 
temperatures in the stress-relieving range. In general, such 
temperatures are higher as the steel thickness increases. The 
coils subsequently cool to ambient temperature with outer and 
inner laps cooling more rapidly than central laps. The differ-
98 
ence in cooling rate can result in measurable differences in the 
mechanical properties throughout a coil. Data confirm reduced 
yield and tensile strength, and increased percent elongation, for 
the product wiili slower cooling rates from the coiling tem­
perature to ambient. Such differences are in addition to the 
effects on mechanical properties caused by differences in heat 
analysis and chemical segregation.

X2. VARIATION OF TENSILE PROPERTIES IN PLATE-AS-ROLLED 
X2.1 The tension requirements of this general requirements 
specification are intended only to characterize the tensile 
properties of a plate-as-rolled for determination of confor­
mance to the requirements of the applicable product specifica­
tions. Such testing procedures are not intended to define the 
upper or lower limits of tensile properties at all possible test 
locations within a plate-as-rolled. It is well known and docu­
mented that tensile properties vary within a plate-as-rolled or 
individual piece of steel as a function of chemical composition, 
processing, testing procedure, and other factors. It is, therefore, 
incumbent on designers and engineers to use sound engineer­
ing judgement when using tension test results shown on mill 
test reports. The testing procedures of this general require­
ments specification have been found to provide plate adequate 
for normal pressure vessel design criteria. 
X2.2 A survey of the variation to be expected in tensile 
properties obtained from plates and strnctural shapes was 
conducted by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). 
The results of this survey are contained in a Contributions to 
the Metallurgy of Steel entitled "The Variation of Product 
Analysis and Tensile Properties-Carbon Steel Plates, and 
Wide Flange Shapes" (SU/18, SU/19, and SU/20), published in 
September 197 4. The data are presented in tables of probability 
that tensile properties at other than the official location may 
differ from those of the reported test location. 
X2.3 This general requirements specification contains no 
requirements applicable to product tension tests; conformance 
to the applicable product specification is determined on the 
basis of tests performed at the place of manufacture or 
processing prior to shipment, unless otherwise specified. 
X2.4 A Task Group of ASTM Subcommittee AOl.11 has 
determined, based on review of the AISI data (SU20), that the 
variation in tensile properties within a plate-as-rolled can be 
expressed as a function of specified requirements; one standard 
deviation equals approximately 3 % of required tensile 
strength, 5 % of required yield strength, and 3 percentage 
points of required elongation. 
X3. VARIATION IN CHARPY V-NOTCH TESTS 
X3. l A survey of the variation to be expected in Charpy 
V-Notch test results obtained from three common fine grain 
plate steels was conducted by the American Iron and Steel 
Institute (AISI). 7 The results of the survey are contained in a 
Contributions to the Metallurgy of Steel entitled, "The Varia­
tions of Charpy V-Notch Impact Test Properties in Steel 
Plates," (SU/24), published January 1979. The survey data 
consists of test values obtained from six locations in addition to 
the locations specified in 12.1.3 of this specification. The plate 
conditions tested involved as-rolled, normalized, and quench 
and tempered. Sufficient full-size specimens were taken from 
each sample so that three longitudinal and three transverse 
specimens could be broken at three test temperatures defined 
for each grade. The data is presented in tables of probability 
that impact properties at other than the official location which 
may differ from those of the reported test location. Additional 
data of the same type, but utilizing samples from thicker plates, 
was published by AISI as SU/27. 
X4. RADIUS FOR COLD BENDING 
X4. l Suggested minimum inside bend radii for cold form­
ing are referenced to group Designations A through F as 
defined in Table X4.1. The suggested radii listed in Table X4.2 
should be used as minimums in typical shop fabrication. 
Material that does not form satisfactorily when fabricated in 
accordance with Table X4.2 may be subject to rejection 
pending negotiation with the steel supplier. When tighter bends 
are required, the manufacturer should be consulted. 
X4.2 The bend radius and the radius of the male die should 
be as liberal as the finished part will permit. The width across 
the shoulders of the female die should be at least 8 times the 
plate thickness. Higher strength steels require larger die open­
ings. The surface of the dies in the area of radius should be 
smooth. 
99 
X4.3 Since cracks in cold bending commonly originate 
from the outside edges, shear burrs and gas cut edges should be 
removed by grinding. Sharp corners on edges and on punched 
or gas cut holes should be removed by chamfering or grinding 
to a radius. 
X4.4 If possible, parts should be formed such that the bend 
line is perpendicular to the direction of final rolling. If it is 
necessary to bend with the bend line parallel to the direction of 
final rolling, a more generous radius is suggested (11/2 times 
applicable value given in Table X4.2 for bend lines perpen­
dicular to the direction of rolling). 
X4.5 References 
X4.5.1 Both of these references are available from Ameri­
can Iron and Steel Institute (AISI):

this general specification shall prevail in the sequence named. 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall used 
independently of the other, and values from the two systems 
shall not be combined. 
1.4 For purposes of determining conformance to this speci­
fication and the various material specifications referenced in 
1.1, dimensional values shall be rounded to the nearest unit in 
the right-hand place of figures used in expressing the limiting 
values in accordance with the rounding method of Practice 
E29. 
NoTE I-Specification A29/A29M previously listed dimensional toler­
ances for cold-finished bars; these are now found in Specification A108. 
l .5 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

4. Chemical Composition 
4.1 Limits: 
4.1.1 The chemical composition shall conform to the re­
quirements specified in the purchase order or the individual 
product specifications. For convenience, the grades commonly 
specified for carbon steel bars are shown in Table 1 and for 
alloy steel bars in Table 2. Bars may be ordered to these grade 
designations and when so ordered shall conform to the speci-
. fied limits by heat analysis. 
4.1.2 When compositions other than those shown in Tables 
1 and 2 are required, the composition limits shall be prepared 
using the ranges and limits shown in Table 3 for carbon steel 
and Table 4 for alloy steel. 
4.2 Heat or Cast Analysis: 
4.2.l The chemical composition of each heat or cast shall be 
determined by the manufacturer in accordance with Test 
Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751. 
4.2.2 The heat or cast analysis shall conform to the require­
ments specified in the product specification or purchase order. 
These can be the heat chemical range and limit for a grade 
designated in Tables 1 and 2, or another range and limit in 
accordance with 4.1.2, or with requirements of the product 
specification. 
Norn 2-Heat analysis for lead is not determinable since lead is added 
to the ladle stream while each ingot is poured. When specified as an added 
element to a standard steel, the percentage of lead is reported as 0.15 to 
0.35 incl, which is the range commonly specified for this element. 
4.2.3 If requested or required, the heat analysis shall be 
reported to the purchaser or his representative. 
4.2.4 Reporting of significant figures and rounding shall be 
in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology 
A751. 
4.3 Product Analysis: 
4.3.1 Merchant quality carbon bar steel is not subject to 
rejection for product analysis unless misapplication of a heat is 
clearly indicated. 
4.3.2 Analyses may be made by the purchaser from finished 
bars other than merchant quality representing each heat of 
open-hearth, basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace steel. The 
chemical composition thus determined shall not vary from the 
limits specified in the applicable specification by more than the 
amounts prescribed in Table 5 and Table 6, but the several 
determinations of any element, excluding lead, in a heat may 
not vary both above and below the specified range. Rimmed or 
capped steel is characterized by a lack of homogeneity in its 
composition, especially for the elements carbon, phosphorus, 
and sulfur; therefore, when rimmed or capped steel is specified 
or required, the limitations for these elements shall not be 
applicable. Because of the degree to which phosphorus and 
sulfur segregate, the limitations for these elements shall not be 
applicable to rephosphorized or resulfurized steels. 
4.3.3 Samples for product analysis shall be taken by one of 
the following methods: 
4.3.3.1 Applicable to small sections whose cross-sectional 
area does not exceed 0.75 in.2 [500 mm 2 ] such as rounds, 
squares, hexagons, and the like. Chips are taken by milling or 
machining the full cross section of the piece. Drilling is not a 
feasible method for sampling sizes 0.75 in. 2 and smaller. 
4.3.3.2 Applicable to products where the width of the cross 
section greatly exceeds the thickness, such as bar size shapes 
and light flat bars. Chips are taken by drilling entirely through 
the steel at a point midway between the edge and the middle of 
the section, or by milling or machining the entire cross section. 
4.3.3.3 Applicable to large rounds, squares semifinished, 
etc. Chips are taken at any point midway between the outside 
and the center of the piece by drilling parallel to the axis or by 
milling or machining the full cross section. In cases where 
these methods are not practicable, the piece may be drilled on 
the side, but chips are not taken until they represent the portion 
midway between the outside and the center. 
4.3.3.4 When the steel is subject to tension test 
requirements, the tension test specimen can also be used for 
product analysis. In that case, chips for product analysis can be 
taken by drilling entirely through the tension test specimens or 
by the method described in 4.3.3.1. 
4.3.4 When chips are taken by chilling, the diameter of the 
drill used shall conform to the following: 
Area of Sample Cross Section, Approximate Drill Diameter, 
in. 2 [cm 2 ] in. [mm] 
16 [1 OD] or less ½ [12.5] 
Over 16 [100] 1 [25.0] 
4.3.5 The minimum number of samples to be taken from 
material representing the same heat or lot before rejection by 
the purchaser shall be as follows: 
104 
Minimum Number 
of Samples 
15 tons [15 Mg] and under 4 
Over 15 tons [15 Mg] 6 
4.3.6 In case the number of pieces in a heat is less than the 
number of samples required, one sample from each piece shall 
be considered sufficient. 
4.3.7 In the event that product analysis determinations are 
outside the permissible limits as prescribed in 4.3.2, additional 
samples shall be analyzed and the acceptability of the heat 
negotiated between the purchaser and the producer. 
4.4 Referee Analysis-In case a referee analysis is required 
and agreed upon to resolve a dispute concerning the results of 
a chemical analysis, the referee analysis shall be performed in 
accordance with the latest issue of Test Methods, Practices, and 
Terminology A751, unless otherwise agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
5. Grain Size Requirement 
5.1 Austenitic Grain Size-All requirements for austenitic 
grain size control in Section 5 refer to the size of the austenite 
grain which forms during a subsequent bar reheating operation 
at or above the recrystallization temperature. These require­
ments do not apply to, nor do they in any way control, the p1ior 
austenite grain size or the ferrite grain size of the bar in the 
as-rolled condition. 
5.1.1 When a coarse austenitic grain size is specified, the 
steel shall have a grain size number of 1 to 5 exclusive as

8 When silicon is required, the following ranges and limits are commonly specified: 0.1 0 %, max, 0.1 0 % to 0.20 %, 0.15 % to 0.35 %, 0.20 % to 0.40 %, or 0.30 % to 
0.60%. 
c Copper can be specified when required as 0.20 % minimum. 
0 When lead is required as an added element to a standard steel, a range of 0.15 to 0.35 % inclusive is specified. Such a steel is identified by inserting the letter "L" between 
the second and third numerals of the grade designation, for example, 10 L 45. A cast or heat analysis is not determinable when lead is added to the ladle stream. 
"When boron treatment for killed steels is specified, the steels can be expected to contain 0.0005 to 0.003 % boron. If the usual titanium additive is not permitted, the 
steels can be expected to contain up to 0.005 % boron. 
FThe elements bismuth, calcium, selenium, or tellurium may be added as agreed upon between purchaser and supplier. 
G Unless prohibited by the purchaser, the manganese content may exceed 0.60 % on heat analysis to a maximum of 0.75 %, provided the carbon range on heat analysis 
has the minimum and maximum reduced by 0.01 % for each 0.05 % manganese over 0.60 %. 
determined in accordance with Test Methods El12. Confor­
mance to this grain size of 70 % of the grains in the area 
examined shall constitute the basis of acceptance. One test per 
heat shall be made. 
5.1.2 When a fine austenitic grain size is specified, the steel 
shall have a grain size number of 5 or higher as determined in 
accordance with Test Methods El12. Conformance to this 
grain size of 70 % of the area examined shall constitute the 
basis of acceptance. One test per heat shall be made unless the 
provisions of 5.1.2.1 or 5.1.2.2 are exercised. 
5.1.2.1 When aluminum is used as the grain refining 
element, the fine austenitic grain size requirement shall be 
deemed to be fulfilled if, on heat analysis, the aluminum 
content is not less than 0.020 % total aluminum or, alternately, 
0.015 % acid soluble aluminum. The aluminum content shall 
be reported. The grain size test specified in 5.1.2 shall be the 
referee test. 
106 
5.1.2.2 By agreement between purchaser and supplier, co­
lumbium or vanadium, or both, may be used for grain refining 
instead of or with aluminum. When columbium or vanadium is 
used as a grain refining element, the fine austenitic grain size 
requirement shall be deemed to be fulfilled if, on heat analysis, 
the columbium or vanadium content is as follows (the content 
of the elements shall be reported with the heat analysis): 
Steels having 0.25 % carbon or less: 
Cb 0.025 min 
V 0.05 min 
Steels having over 0.25 % carbon: 
Cb 0.Q15 min 
V 0.02 min

| Norte 1—Small quantities of certain elements are present in alloy steels, which are not specified or required. These elements are considered as incidental :
and may be present to the following maximum amounts: copper, 0.35 %; nickel, 0.25 %; chromium, 0.20 % and molybdenum, 0.06 %.
Note 2—Where minimum and maximum sulfur content is shown it is indicative of resulfurized steel. i
Note 3—The chemical ranges and limits shown in Table 2 are produced to product analysis tolerances shown in Table 6. |
| Norse 4—Standard alloy steels can be produced with a lead range of 0.15 to 0.35 %. Such steels are identified by inserting the letter “L” between the
second and third numerals of the AISI number, for example, 41 L 40. A cast or heat analysis is not determinable when lead is added to the ladle stream. :

6. Mechanical Property Requirements 
6.1 Test Specimens: 
6.1.1 Selection-Test specimens shall be selected in accor­
dance with the requirements of the applicable product specifi­
cation or in accordance with Supplement I of the latest issue of 
Test Methods and Definitions A370, in the sequence named. 
6.1.2 Preparation-Unless otherwise specified in the appli­
cable product specification, test specimens shall be prepared in 
accordance w1th the latest issue of Test Methods and Defini­
tions A370, and especially Supplement I thereof. 
6.2 Methods of Mechanical Testing-All mechanical tests 
shall be conducted in accordance with the latest issue of Test 
Methods and Definitions A370, and especially Supplement I 
thereof, on steel bar products. 
6.3 Retests: 
6.3.1 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws, the specimen may be discarded and another 
substituted. 
6.3.2 If the percentage elongation of any tension specimen 
is less than that specified and any part of the fracture is more 
than ¾ in. [20 mm] from the center of a 2 in. [50 mm] 
specimen, or is outside the middle half of the gage length of an 
8 in. [200 mm] specimen as indicated by scribe scratches 
marked on the specimen before testing, a retest shall be 
allowed. 
6.3.3 For "as-wrought" material, if the results for any 
original tension specimen are within 2000 psi [14 MPa] of the 
required tensile strength, within 1000 psi [7 MPa] of the 
required yield point, or within 2 % of the required elongation, 
retesting shall be permitted. If the original testing required only 
one test, the retest shall consist of two random tests from the 
heat or lot involved. If the original testing required two tests of 
which one failed by the amounts listed in this paragraph, the 
retest shall be made on one random test from the heat or lot. If 
the results on the retest specimen or specimens meet the 
specified requirements, the heat or test lot will be accepted. If 
the results of one retest specimen do not meet the specified 
requirements, the material is subject to rejection. 
6.3.4 For thermally treated bars, if the results of the me­
chanical tests do not conform to the requirements specified, 
two more tests may be selected for each bar failing, and each 
of these retests shall conform to the requirements of the 
product specification. 
6.3.5 If a bend specimen fails, due to conditions of bending 
more severe than required by the specification, a retest shall be 
permitted from the heat or test lot involved for which one 
random specimen for each original specimen showing failure 
shall be used. If the results on the retest specimen meet the 
requirements of the specification, the heat or test lot will be 
accepted. 
7. Dimensions, Mass, and Permissible Variations 
7 .1 Hot-Wrought Bars-The permissible variations for di­
mensions of hot-wrought carbon and alloy steel bars shall not 
exceed the applicable limits stated in Annex Al for inch-pound 
values and Annex A2 for metric values. 
8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
8.1 The material shall be free of injurious defects and shall 
have a workmanlike finish. 
9. Rework and Retreatment 
109 
9.1 For thermally treated bars only, the manufacturer may 
retreat a lot one or more times, and retests shall be made in the 
same manner as the original tests. Each such retest shall 
conform to the requirements specified. 
10. Inspection 
10.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry, at all times while work on the contract of the purchaser

number where appropriate, size and length, weight of lift, and 
the heat number for identification. Unless otherwise specified, 
the method of marking is at the manufacturer's option and may 
be made by hot stamping, cold stamping, painting, or marking 
tags attached to the lifts of bars. 
111 
13.1.1 Bar code marking may be used as an auxiliary 
method of identification. Such bar-code markings shall be of 
the 3-of-9 type and shall conform toAlAG Bl. When barcoded 
tags are used, they shall conform to AIAG BS. 
13.2 Government Procurement: 
13.2.1 Marking for shipment shall be in accordance with the 
requirements specified in the contract or order and shall be in 
accordance with MIL-STD-163 for military agencies and in 
accordance with Fed. Std. No. 123 for civil agencies.

A When a square is held against a face and an edge of a square edge flat bar, the edge shall not deviate by more than 3° or 5 % of the thickness. 
8 Steel bars are regularly cut to length by shearing or hot sawing, which can cause end distortion resulting in those portions of the bar being outside the applicable size 
tolerance. When this end condition is objectionable, a machine cut end should be considered. 
c Flats over 6 to 8 in., incl, in width, are not available as hot-wrought steel bars in thickness under 0.230 in.
