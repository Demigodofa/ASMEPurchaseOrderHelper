Standard Specification for 
Stainless Chromium Steel-Clad Plate 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers plate of a carbon steel or 
low-alloy steel base to which is integrally and continuously 
bonded on one or both sides a layer of stainless chromium 
steel. The material is generally intended for pressure vessel 
use. 
1.2 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as standard. The values given in parentheses are mathematical 
conversions to SI units that are provided for information only 
and are not considered standard.

3. Terminology 
3 .1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 This material is considered as single-clad or double­
clad stainless chromium-steel plate, depending on whether one 
or both sides are covered. 
3.1.2 alloy cladding-the stainless chromium steel compo­
nent of the composite plate. 
3.1.3 base metal (backing steel)-component to which the 
alloy cladding is applied, usually the greater percentage of the 
composite plate. 
3.1.4 integrally and continuously bonded-a condition in 
which the alloy cladding and base metal are brought together to 
form a metallurgical bond at essentially the entire interface of 
the two metals by means other than those processes that do not 
produce a homogeneous composite plate. 
4. Ordering Information 
374 
4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces). 
4.1.2 Cladding alloy specification (UNS or ASTM Specifi­
cation A240/ A240M) and whether cladding is for corrosion 
allowance only. 
4.1.3 Base metal specification. 
4.1.4 Bond integrity Class (1, 3, or S; see Section 13). 
4.1.S Dimensions including the minimum or nominal thick-
nesses of the cladding alloy and the backing steel, or of the 
total composite and if more or less restrictive thickness 
tolerances apply. 
4.1.6 Product analysis, ifrequired (see Section 10). Specify 
whether applicable to the cladding alloy, backing steel, or both.

4.1. 7 Mechanical properties including shear test if required 
(see Sections 7, 8, and 9). 
4.1.8 Finish (see Section 12). 
4.1.9 Restrictions, if required, on repair by welding (see 
Section 14). 
4.1.10 Additions to the specification or special requirements 
such as any applicable construction code rules. 
4.1.11 Notification when the cladding alloy is to be used for 
inclusion in the design strength calculations for an applicable 
construction code. 
Norn I-Construction codes may dictate certain fabrication require­
ments when the cladding is used in the design calculations that may be 
different than if the cladding is used for corrosion resistance only. This 
may be particularly important when the alloy cladding involves the use of 
welded components in the explosion bonded clad manufacturing process. 
It is incumbent on the purchaser to make the clad manufacturer aware of 
any such restrictions or applications at time of order. 
4.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this specification 
and the backing steel specification, certain supplementary 
requirements are available when additional control, testing, or 
examination is required to meet end use requirements. The 
purchaser is referred to the listed supplementary requirements 
in this specification and to the detailed requirements in 
Specification A20/A20M. 
4.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Process: 
5.1.1 The steel shall be made by the open-heaiih, electric­
fumace, or basic-oxygen processes, or by secondary processes 
whereby steel made from these primary processes is remelted 
using, but not limited to electroslag remelting or vacuum-arc 
remelting processes. 
5.1.2 The alloy-cladding metal may be metallurgically 
bonded to the base metal by any method that will produce a 
clad steel that will conform to the requirements of this 
specification. 
5.1.3 For explosively bonded products, the alloy cladding 
metal may be comprised of two or more separate alloy plates 
or sheets completely welded together to fonn a single fabri­
cated component. 
5.2 Heat Treatment-Unless otherwise specified or agreed 
upon between the purchaser and the manufacturer, all plates 
shall be furnished in the normalized, tempered, normalized and 
tempered, or quenched and tempered condition as permitted by 
the backing steel specification. Stress relieving of the compos­
ite plate by heating subcritically is permitted, provided the 
temperature is 75°F (40°C) or more below the minimum 
tempering temperature (when tempered). 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The composite plate shall conform to any desired 
combination of alloy-cladding metal and base metal as de­
scribed in 6.2 and 6.3 and as agreed upon between the 
purchaser and the manufacturer. 
6.2 Alloy Cladding Metal-The alloy-cladding metal speci­
fied shall conform to the requirements as to chemical compo­
sition prescribed for the respective chromium steel in Specifi­
cation A240/A240M. 
6.3 Base Metal-The base metal shall be carbon steel or 
low-alloy steel conforming to the ASTM specifications for 
steels for pressure vessels or other as agreed by the purchaser 
and the manufacturer. The base metal shall conform to the 
chemical requirements of the specification to which it is 
ordered. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Tensile Requirements: 
7 .1.1 The tensile properties shall be determined by a tension 
test of the composite plate for clad plates that meet all of the 
following conditions. 
(I) The nominal composite gage is less than or equal to 
1 ½ in. (38 mm). 
(2) The specified minimum tensile strength of the base 
steel is less than or equal to 70 000 psi ( 485 MPa). 
( 3) The specified minimum yield strength of the base steel 
is less than or equal to 40 000 psi (275 MPa). 
The tensile properties thus determined shall be not less than 
the minimum and not more than 5000 psi (35 MPa) over the 
maximum prescribed in the specification for the base steel 
used. All other tensile test requirements of the specification for 
the base steel shall be met. 
7 .1.2 The tensile properties shall be determined by a tension 
test of the base steel only for clad plates that meet one of the 
following conditions. The properties thus determined shall 
meet all of the tensile test requirements for the base steel. 
(I) The composite gage is greater than 1 ½ in. (38 nnn). 
(2) The specified minimum tensile strength of the base 
steel is greater than 70 000 psi (485 MPa). 
(3) The specified minimum yield strength of the base steel 
is greater than 40 000 psi (275 MPa). 
7 .1.3 If the cladding is for corrosion allowance only, the 
cladding need not be included in the tensile test. The tensile 
properties thus determined shall meet the base steel require­
ments. 
7 .2 Tests for strength of the bond, when required, must be 
specified by the purchaser and shall consist of one of the 
following. 
7.2.1 Shear Strength-When required by the purchaser, the 
minimum shear strength of the alloy cladding and base metals 
shall be 20 000 psi (140 MPa). The shear test, when specified, 
shall be made in the manner indicated in Fig. 1. The minimum 
cladding thickness for.shear testing shall be 0.075 in. (1.9 mm) 
exclusive as ordered. Testing for shear strength for clad plates 
with minimum cladding thickness of 0.075 in. (1.9 mm) or less 
shall be permitted upon agreement between the purchaser and 
the manufacturer. 
375 
7.2.2 Bond Strength-As an alternative to the shear strength 
test provided in 7.2.1, or when agreed upon by the purchaser 
and the manufacturer, or both, three bend tests shall be made 
with the alloy cladding in compression to determine the quality 
of the bond. These bend tests shall be made in the manner of 
the tension tests indicated in Fig. 2 and shall be bent through an

edges parallel. In reducing the thickness of the specimen, both 
the alloy cladding and the base steel shall be machined so as to 
maintain the same ratio of clad metal to base steel as is 
maintained in the plate, except that the thickness of the clad 
metal need not be reduced below Vs in. (3.1 mm). The sides of 
the bend test specimen used for bond strength determination 
may have the corners rounded to a radius not over V16 in. (1.6 
mm) for plates, 2 in. (50 mm) and under in thickness, and not 
over Vs in. (3.1 mm) for plates over 2 in. (50 mm) in thickness. 
10. Product Analysis 
10.1 Product analysis may be required for the cladding alloy 
on the finished product. Chemical analysis may be accom­
plished by wet chemical or instrumental procedures. If wet 
chemical procedures are used, millings may be taken only 
when the composite plate thickness is sufficient to permit 
obtaining millings without danger of contamination from the 
adjacent layer. If spectrometric procedures are used, the sample 
shall be exposed on the center line of the cladding when there 
is sufficient cladding thickness available so that there is no 
contamination from the adjacent base metal. 
10.2 If product analysis is specified by the purchaser for the 
cladding alloy, it shall be made from drillings or millings taken 
from the final piece or a broken test specimen. For wet 
chemical analysis, in order to avoid contamination by the base 
plate metal, millings of cladding samples shall be taken from 
the test coupon by removal and discard of all the base metal 
plate material, plus 40 % of the cladding thickness from the 
bonded side, not to exceed V16 in. (1.6 mm). The material shall 
be chemically cleaned and sufficient millings shall be taken to 
represent the full cross-section of the remainder. If there is 
insufficient cladding thickness available to spectrographically 
expose on the center line of the cladding without 
contamination, 50 % of the cladding shall be removed and the 
sample exposed on this surface. 
10.3 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with the 
Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology of A751. 
10.4 Results of the product analysis shall conform to the 
requirements of Section 7 of Specification A480/A480M. 
10.5 Results of the product analysis for the backing steel 
when required shall conform to the requirements of Section 7 
of Specification A20/A20M. 
11. Permissible Variations 
11.1 Permissible variations except for thickness shall be in 
accordance with Specification A20/ A20M. 
11.2 Minimum thickness of the alloy cladding metal and of 
the backing steel, or of the total composite plate shall be as 
required by purchase order documents when ordered to mini­
mum thicknesses. 
11.3 Permissible variation in thickness when ordered to 
nominal thicknesses shall be 0.01 in. (0.3 mm) under each for 
backing steel or total composite, and 0.03 in. (0.8 mm) under 
for the alloy cladding . 
11.4 Permissible variations for excess thickness of the total 
composite shall be the greater of 0.125 in. (3 mm) or 10 % of 
the total composite thickness ordered and may occur in either 
backing steel, cladding, or both, provided the minimum for 
each is met. 
11.5 More restrictive or less restrictive permissible varia­
tions may be agreed upon by the purchaser and the manufac­
turer. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The material shall be free of injurious defects, shall 
have a workmanlike appearance, and shall conform to the 
designated finish. 
12.2 Plate alloy surfaces shall be blasted (descaled by 
means such as sand or stainless grit, shot or wire, or 
equivalent), pickled, blast-cleaned and pickled, or 100 % 
conditioned. 
13. Bond Quality 
13.1 The cladding metal shall be integrally and continu­
ously bonded to the base metal. 
13.2 Inspection: 
13.2.1 Clad plates less than 3/s in. (10 mm) total minimum 
composite thickness shall be visually inspected for bond 
integrity prior to shipment. 
13.2.2 Clad plates 3/s in. (10 mm) and thicker total minimum 
composite thickness, and when specified by the purchaser, clad 
plates less than 3/s in. (10 mm) total minimum composite 
thickness, shall be ultrasonically inspected for bond integrity 
prior to shipment in accordance with the Procedures and 
Methods of Specification A578/A578M. 
13.2.3 Areas of non-bond detected visually shall be ex­
plored ultrasonically to determine the extent of the condition in 
accordance with 13.2.2. For purposes of defining non-bond, the 
cladding shall be interpreted to be unbonded when there is 
complete loss of back reflection accompanied by an echo 
indication from the plane of the interface of the clad and 
backing steel. Areas within 1 in. (25 mm) of a cut edge on the 
plate that contain indications exceeding 50 % of the back 
reflection at the bond interface shall be considered to be 
unbonded. 
13.2.4 Extent of ultrasonic examination shall be at the 
discretion of the manufacturer and sufficient enough to provide 
the quality level required by the purchaser. Plates may be 
ordered with 100 % coverage (Supplementary Requirements 
S12). 
13.3 Quality Levels: 
377 
13.3.1 Class I-No single unbonded area exceeding 1 in. 
(25 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not 
to exceed 1 % of the total cladded surface area. 
13.3.2 Class 3-No single unbonded area exceeding 3 in. 
(75 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not 
to exceed 3 % of the total cladded surface area. 
13.3.3 • Class 5-No single unbonded area exceeding 9 in.2 
(58 cm 2 ) with total unbonded area not to exceed 5 % of the 
total cladded surface area.
