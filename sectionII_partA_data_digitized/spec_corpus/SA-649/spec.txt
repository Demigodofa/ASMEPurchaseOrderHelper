~u 11 7 
INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Forged Steel Rolls Used for Corrugating Paper Machinery 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A649/ A649M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification 2 covers two kinds of rolls used in 
machinery for producing corrugated paperboard. Rolls are 
fabricated of forged bodies and trunnions. The trunnions may 
be bolted or shrink assembled on one or both ends of the body. 
A seal weld may be made at the body/trunnion interface. Roll 
shells are made of carbon/manganese, or low alloy steel as 
hereinafter described, and are heat treated prior to assembly. 
Pressure rolls may be ordered surface hardened as Condition 
H, or without surface hardening as Condition S. Provision is 
made in Supplementary Requirements S 1 and S3 for the 
optional surface hardening of corrugating rolls. 
1.2 Corrugating and pressure rolls made to this specification 
shall not exceed 30 in. [760 mm] in inside diameter. The wall 
thickness of the roll body shall not be less than 1/12 of the inside 
diameter or 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is greater, but shall not 
exceed 4 in. [100 mm]. The wall thickness of the corrugating 
roll is measured at the bottom of the corrugations in the 
location of the trunnion fit. The maximum design temperature 
(MDT) of the roll is 600 °F [315 °C] and the maximum 
allowable working pressure (MAWP) is 250 psi [1.7 MPa]. The 
minimum design temperature shall be 40 °F [4 °C] for roll wall 
thicknesses up to 3 in. [75 mm]. For roll wall thicknesses over 
3 in. [75 mm] to 4 in. [100 mm], the minimum design 
temperature shall be 120 °F [50 °C]. The maximum stresses on 
the roll bodies from the combined internal and external loading 
are limited to 18 750 psi [129 MPa] for the Class 2 pressure 
roll bodies, and 20 000 psi [138 MPa] for Class lA, lB, or 5 
pressure or corrugating roll bodies in Grades 1 or 2. For the 
trunnions, the maximum stresses from the combined internal 
and external loading are limited to 15 000 psi [103.4 MPa] for 
Classes 3 or 4, or 20 000 psi [138 MPa] for Classes IA, lB, or 
5 in Grade 2 only. The Grade 1 strength level is not pennissible 
for trunnions. 
1.3 Referring to Table 1, material to Classes lA, lB, or 5 
shall be used for the manufacture of corrugating or pressure

roll shells, and Class 2 shall be used only for pressure roll 
shells. Trunnions shall be made from forgings in Classes lA, 
lB, or 5 in Grade 2 strength level as restricted by Footnote B 
in Table 2 or in forgings in either Class 3 or 4. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other, and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined. 
1.5 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch­
pound units. 
1.6 Except as specifically required in this standard, all of the 
provisions of Specification A788/A788M apply. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

by the forging supplier, prior to forming the flutes by the 
purchaser, the requirements of Supplementary Requirement S 1 
shall apply. 
3.5 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, then the 
requirements of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Forging Process: 
4.1.1 Roll body forgings may be made as solid forgings and 
subsequently bored. 
4.1.2 Trunnions or gudgeons which are to be subsequently 
assembled to form the roll shall be made as a solid forging or 
where practical upset from segments cut from billets or bars. 
4.2 Heat Treatment: 
4.2.1 Heat Treatment for Mechanical Properties (Require­
ments do not apply to surface treatment): 
4.2.1.1 Machining-The forged roll body shall have all 
surfaces rough machined, including boring, prior to heat 
treatment for mechanical properties and be tested in accor­
dance with 6.1.2.1. The manufacturer may opt to bore after 
heat treatment for mechanical properties instead provided the 
forging is tested in accordance with 6.1.2.2. 
4.2.1.2 Roll bodies shall be normalized, liquid quenched, 
and tempered to produce the required mechanical properties, 
except that for Class 2 forgings, and when Grade 2 strength 
requirements are specified, a normalize and temper heat 
treatment may be applied. 
4.2.1.3 The trunnions shall be normalized and tempered or 
annealed to produce the required mechanical properties. 
4.2.2 Su,face Hardening of Pressure Roll Forgings-For 
Condition H the working face of pressure rolls shall be surface 
hardened either before or after fitting the trunnions, at the 
manufacturer's option. Surface hardening by weld overlays is 
not permitted for Condition H or (subsequently) for Condition 
s. 
4.3 Assembly and Weld-Except for integrally forged or 
bolted-on trunnions, the assembly shall be made by shrink 
fitting trunnions into the prepared body ends. If used, welding 
of the trunnion to the roll body is restricted to a 3/s in. [9.5 mm] 
max. seal weld, made with low hydrogen materials. A mini­
mum preheat of 400 °F [205 °C] and a minimum post weld 
heat treatment of 850 °F [455 °C] for 8 h shall be used. The 
maximum post weld heat treatment shall be not higher than t -
50 °F [t - 28 °C] where tis the final tempering temperature. All 
welds shall be machined or ground for the final magnetic 
particle or liquid penetrant examination.

Hot-Rolled Structural Steel, High-Strength Low-Alloy Plate 
with Improved Formability 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers three types and five strength 
grades of high-strength low-alloy, hot-rolled structural steel 
plate for use in truck frames, brackets, crane booms, rail cars, 
and similar applications. Steels that conform to this specifica­
tion offer improved formability. These steels are normally 
furnished in the as-rolled condition. The type and strength 
grade furnished is as agreed upon between the manufacturer 
and the purchaser. The types and strength grades are shown in 
the tables. 
1.2 The maximum thickness of plates shall be as follows: 
Grade Plate Thickness, max, 
in.[mm] 
50 2 [50] 
60 1½ [40] 
70 1 [25] 
00 1• 
100 ½~~ 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded as standard. Within the text, the SI units are 
shown in brackets. The values stated in each system are not 
exact equivalents; therefore, each system must be used inde­
pendently of the other. Combining values from the two systems 
may result in nonconformance with this specification. 
1.4 For plates produced from coil and furnished without 
heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the additional 
requirements, including additional testing requirements and the 
reporting of additional test results, of Specification A6/ A6M 
apply. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

of a coil into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, 
leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, 
heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for 
shipment, and certification. 
ND'I'E 1-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat 
treatment or with stress relieving only, two test results are to be reported 
for each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plate produced 
from coil are described in Specification A6/A6M. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel shall be made to fine grain practice. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Heat analyses shall conform to the chemical require­
ments given in Table 1. Dependent upon thickness, grade, and 
intended application, variations in the chemical composition 
are permitted within the limits given in Table 1 for the 
applicable type. Where it is of particular importance, the 
manufacturer should be consulted for specific chemical com­
position. 
5.2 Product Analysis-If a product analysis is made, it shall 
conform to the requirements given in Table 1, subject to the 
product analysis tolerances of Specification A6/A6M.

S 1. l Product analysis shall be made on each length of pipe. 
Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical compo­
sition requirements shall be rejected. 
S2. Additional Tension Tests 
S2. l An additional tension test shall be made on a specimen 
from one or each end of each pipe. If this supplementary 
requirement is specified, the number of tests per pipe required 
shall be specified. If a specimen from any length fails to meet 
the required tensile properties (tensile, yield, and elongation), 
that length shall be rejected subject to retreatment in accor­
dance with Specification A530/A530M and satisfactory retest. 
S3. Additional Flattening Tests 
S3.1 The flattening test of Specification A530/A530M shall 
be made on a specimen from one end or both ends of each pipe. 
Crop ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is 
specified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. 
If a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility 
prior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening 
test requirement that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat­
ment in accordance with Specification A530/A530M and 
satisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length. of pipe fails 
because of a lack of soundness that length shall be rejected, 
unless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length 
is sound. 
S4. Metal Structure and Etching Tests 
S4.1 The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching 
tests conducted in accordance with the appropriate portions of 
Method E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section 
from one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound 
and reasonably uniform material free from injurious lamina­
tions, cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this supple­
mentary requirement is specified, the number of tests per pipe 
required shall also be specified. If a specimen from any length 
shows objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, 
subject to removal of the defective end and subsequent retests 
indicating the remainder of the length to be sound and 
reasonably uniform material. 
SS. Photomicrographs 
S5.1 The manufacturer shall furnish one photomicrograph 
at 100 diam.eters from a specimen of pipe in the as-finished 
condition representing each heat in each heat-treatment lot. 
Such photomicrographs shall be suitably identified as to pipe 
size, wall thickness, and heat. No photomicrographs for the 
individual pieces purchased shall be required except as speci­
fied in Supplementary Requirement S6. Such photomicro­
graphs are for information only, to show the actual metal 
structure of the pipe as furnished. 
S6. Photographs for Individual Pieces 
S6.1 In addition to the photomicrographs required in accor­
dance with Supplementary Requirement S5, the purchaser may 
specify that photomicrographs shall be furnished from one or 
both ends of each pipe. All photomicrographs required shall be 
properly identified as to heat number, size, and wall thickness 
of pipe from which the section was taken. Photomicrographs 
shall be further identified to permit association of each photo­
micrograph with the individual length of pipe it represents. 
S7. Radiographic Inspection 
S7 .1 The pipe shall be examined for internal defects by 
means of X rays or gamma rays. The inspection procedure shall 
be in accordance with Practice E94 or Method E142 and the 
types and severity levels of discontinuities considered shall be 
judged by Reference Radiographs E446, or Reference Radio­
graphs E186. The extent of examination and the basis for 
acceptance shall be subject to agreement between the manu­
facturer and the purchaser. A specification which may be used 
as a basis for such agreement is "Quality Standard for Steel 
Castings for Valves, Flanges and Fittings and Other Piping

tings Industry. 
S8. Ultrasonic Tests 
S8.1 Each pipe shall be ultrasonically tested to determine its 
soundness throughout the entire length of the pipe. Evidence of 
the existence of defects in excess of 5 % of the wall thickness 
shall be cause for rejection or repair. 
S8.2 The ultrasonic test shall be made in accordance with 
Practice El14, or by any other established method mutually 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
S9. Magnetic Particle or Fluid Penetrant Examination 
S9.1 Each pipe along outside and inside surfaces shall be 
subjected, after machining, to examination by a magnetic 
particle method or a penetrant fluid and powder method. 
S9.2 The extent of examination and the basis for acceptance 
shall be subject to agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. Reference Photographs E125 may be used to define

Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Carbon-Manganese-Silicon Steel, 
for Moderate and Lower Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers three grades of carbon­
manganese-silicon steel plates intended pdmarily for service in 
welded pressure vessels where improved low temperature 
notch toughness is important. 
1.2 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.3 For plates produced from coil and furnished without 
heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the additional 
requirements, including additional testing requirements and the 
reporting of additional test results, of Specification A20/ A20M 
apply. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material supplied to this matedal specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted vadations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordedng information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. 
3.3 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates 
produced from coil means plates tl1at have been cut to 
individual lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or 
is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of 
coils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, 
leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, 
heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for 
shipment, and certification. 
Norn 1-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat 
treatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are reported for 
each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plates from coil 
are described in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail.

7. Sampling 
7.1 Tension and bend-test specimens of sheet, strip, 
and plate products shall be selected from finished material 
and shall be selected in the transverse direction, except in 
the case of strip under 9 in. (229 mm) in width, in which 
case tension test specimens shall be selected in the longitu­
dinal direction. 
7.2 Flat bar tension and bend-test specimens shall be 
selected from the finished material and shall be in the 
longitudinal direction. 
7.3 Corrosion samples, if required, shall be taken from 
material after final annealing and descaling and prior to 
cold working. 
8. Number of Tests 
8.1 For cold-worked product produced in coil form, 
one tension test shall be made from each end of each coil. 
One bend test shall be made from one end of each coil. 
8.2 For cold-worked flat bar and plate products, two 
tension test and one bend test shall be made on each size 
of flat bar and each thickness of plate from each heat in a 
lot annealed in a single charge or under the same conditions 
in a continuous furnace. 
8.3 Annealed material produced to Table 2 require­
ments shall be tested in accordance with Specification 
A 480/ A 480M. 
9. Test Meth.ods 
9.1 Tension Test: 
9.1.1 The yield strength shall be determined by the 
offset method as described in Test Methods and Definitions 
A 370. An alternative method of determining field strength 
may be used based on the following total extension 
under load: 
Yield Strength, min. psi 
45 000 
75 000 
110 000 
135 000 
140 000 
Total Extension under Load in 2 in. 
Gage Length, incl. 
0.0071 
0.0098 
0.0125 
0.0144 
0.0148 
9.1.2 The requirement of this specification for yield 
strength will be considered as having been fulfilled if the 
extension under load for the specified yield strength does 
not exceed the specified values. The values obtained in 
this manner should not, however, be taken as the actual 
yield strength for 0.2%. In case of dispute, the offset 
method of determining yield strength shall be used. 
9.2 Bend Test: 
9.2.1 Bend-test specimens shall withstand cold bend­
ing without cracking when subjected to either the free­
bend method or the controlled-bend (V-block) method at 
the condition specified by Table 3 or Table 4, respectively. 
Specimens shall be bent around a diameter equal to the 
product of the bend factor times the specified thickness of 
the test specimen. The choice of test method for materials 
in conditions other than annealed shall be at the option of 
the seller. 
9.2.2 Free-bend test specimens shall be bent cold, 
either by pressure or by blows. However, in the case of 
dispute, tests shall be made by pressure. 
9.2.3 Controlled-bend (V-block) test specimens shall 
be bent cold by means of V-blocks or a mating punch 
and die having an included angle of 45° and with proper 
curvature of surface at the bend areas to impart the desired 
shape and diameter of bend to the specimen.

Centrifugally Cast Dual Metal (Gray and White Cast Iron) 
Cylinders 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers centrifugally cast cylinders 
with an outer layer of white cast iron and the remainder of the 
material of gray cast iron. These castings are suitable for 
pressure containing parts the design strength of which is based 
on the gray iron portion of the cylinder. These castings are 
suitable for service at temperatures up to 450°F [230°C]. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.3 The following safety hazards caveat pertains only to the 
test method portion, Section 8, of this specification: This 
standard does not purport to address all of the sqfety concerns, 
if' any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user 
of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limita­
tions prior to use.

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES 
SA-675/SA-675M 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 675/ A 675M-03(2009) except that Supplementary Requirement S7 has Grades 65 and 70 added, and S7 is 
mandatory. Sections 4.1.9 and 10 revised to make certification mandatory.] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers hot-wrought special qual­
ity carbon steel bars and bar size shapes produced to 
mechanical property requirements and intended for general 
constructional applications. 
1.2 The bars are available in nine strength grades desig­
nated 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 90 [310, 345, 
380, 415, 450, 485, 515, 550, and 620] corresponding to 
the minimum ultimate tensile strength in ksi [MPa]. The 
chemical composition is selected by the manufacturer to 
develop the required mechanical properties. 
1.3 Hot-wrought special quality carbon steel bars sub­
ject to mechanical property requirements are hot wrought 
in straight lengths only. Sections and sizes available are 
covered in Specification A 29 / A 29M. 
1.4 Some applications may require one or more of the 
available designations shown under Supplementary 
Requirements. 
NOTE 1 - Merchant-quality hot-wrought carbon steel bars subject to 
mechanical property requirements are covered in Specification 
A663/A663M. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as the standard. Within 
the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values 
stated in each system are not equivalents, therefore each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconfonnance 
with the specification.

5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Melting Practice - The steel shall be made by one 
or more of the following primary processes: open-hearth, 
basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace. The primary melting 
may incorporate separate degassing or refining and may 
be followed by secondary melting using electroslag remelt­
ing or vacuum-arc remelting. Where secondary melting is 
employed, the heat shall be defined as all of the ingots 
remelted from a single primary heat. 
5.2 Deoxidation: 
5.2.1 Unless otherwise specified, the steel shall be 
rimmed, capped, semi-killed, or killed at the producer's 
option. 
5.2.2 When required, the purchaser may specify the 
required deoxidation practice, dependent upon strength 
grade specified, purchaser's methods of fabrication, and 
end use requirements. Killed steels can be produced to 
coarse or fine austenitic grain size ( Supplementary Require­
ment Sl). 
5.3 Condition - Unless otherwise specified, the bars 
shall be furnished as-rolled and not pickled, blast cleaned, 
or oiled. At the producer's option, bars may be cleaned 
for inspection. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical require­

6.2 Leaded Steel - When required, lead may be speci­
fied as an added element. When lead is specified as an 
added element, a range from 0.15 to 0.35 % inclusive shall 
be furnished. Such a steel is identified by adding the letter 
L after the grade designation, for example 60L [415L]. 
6.3 Copper-Bearing Steel - When required copper may 
be specified as an added element. Copper-bearing steel is 
identified by stating "copper-bearing" on the purchase 
order. 
6.4 When tension tests are waived in accordance with 
7 .1.1.2, chemistry consistent with the mechanical proper­
ties desired shall be applied.

SA·688/SA-688M . ASME BPVC.II.A·2025 
6.2 Seamless Tubing: 
6.2.1 Seamless tubing shall be supplied from a cold finish­
ing process. Hot finishing as the final sizing process is not 
allowed. 
6.3 Welded Tubing: 
6.3.1 The tube shall be made from flat-rolled steel by an 
automatic welding process with no addition of filler metal. 
6.3.2 Subsequent to welding and prior to final heat 
treatment, the tubes shall be cold worked either in both the 
weld and base metal, or in the weld metal only. The method of 
cold work may be specified by the purchaser. When cold 
drawn, the purchaser may specify the minimum amount of 
reduction in cross-sectional area or wall thickness, or both. 
6.4 Many surface contaminants may have detrimental ef­
fects on high temperature properties or corrosion resistance of 
tubing. Contamination by copper, lead, mercury, zinc, 
chlorides, or sulfur may be detrimental to stainless steels. The 
manufacturer shall employ techniques that minimize surface 
contamination by these elements. 
7. Cleaning Before Annealing 
7 .1 All lubricants of coatings used in the manufacture of 
straight-length tube or in the bending shall be removed from all 
surfaces prior to any annealing treatments. U-bends on which 
a lubricant had been applied to the inside surface during 
bending shall have the cleanness of their inside surface 
confirmed by blowing close fitting acetone-soaked felt plugs 
through 10 % of the tubes of each bend radius. Dry, oil-free, air 
or inert gas shall be used to blow the plugs through the tubes. 
If the plugs blown through any tube shows more than a light 
gray discoloration, all tubes that have had a lubricant applied to 
the inside surface during bending shall be recleaned. After 
recleaning 10 % of the tubes of each bend radius whose inside 
surface had been subjected to bending lubricants shall be 
retested. 
8. Heat Treatment 
8.1 All finished straight tubing or straight tubing ready for 
U-bending shall be furnished in the solution-annealed condi­
tion. The annealing procedure, except for N08367, S31254, 
S32654, N08810, N08811, and N08926, shall consist of 
heating the material to a minimum temperature of 1900 °F 
[1040 °C] followed by a rapid cooling to below 700 °F [370 
°C]. The cooling rate shall be sufficiently rapid to prevent 
harmful carbide precipitation as determined in Section 13. 
8.2 UNS N08367 shall be solution annealed at 2025 °F 
[1107 °C] minimum followed by rapid quenching. 
8.3 N08926 shall be heat-treated at a minimum temperature 
of 2010 °F [1100 °C] followed by quenching in water or 
rapidly cooling by other means. 
8.4 S31254, S32654, and N08811 shall be solution annealed 
at 2100 °F [1150 °C] minimum followed by rapid quenching. 
8.5 N08810 shall be heat-treated to a minimum temperature 
of 2050 °F [1120 °C] minimum followed by rapid quenching. 
8.6 If heat treatment of U-bends is specified, it shall satisfy 
the annealing procedure described above, and shall be done as 
follows: 
8.6.1 The heat treatment shall be applied to the U-bend area 
plus approximately 6 in. [150 mm] of each leg beyond the 
tangent point of the U-bend. 
8.6.2 If the heat treatment specified in 8.6 is accomplished 
by resistance-heating methods wherein electrodes are clamped 
to the tubes, the clamped areas shall be visually examined for 
arc bums. Burn indications shall be cause for rejection unless 
they can be removed by local polishing without encroaching 
upon minimum wall thickness. 
8.6.3 Temperature control shall be accomplished through 
the use of optical or emission pyrometers, or both. No 
temperature-indicating crayons, lacquers, or pellets shall be 
used. 
8.6.4 The inside of the tube shall be purged with a protective 
or an inert gas atmosphere during heating and cooling to below 
700 °F [370 °C] to prevent scaling of the inside surface. The 
atmosphere should be noncarburizing. 
9. Surface Condition 
9.1 The straight tubes, after final annealing, shall be pickled 
using a solution of nitric and hydrofluoric acids followed by 
flushing and rinsing in water. If bright annealing is performed, 
this requirement does not apply. 
9.2 Alight oxide scale on the outside surface ofU-bend area 
shall be permitted for tubes which have been electric-resistance 
heat treated after bending. 
10. Chemical Composition 
10.1 Product Analysis: 
10.1.1 When requested in the purchase order, a product 
analysis shall be made by the supplier from one tube or coil of 
steel per heat. The chemical composition shall conform to the 
requirements shown in Table 1. 
10.1.2 A product analysis tolerance of Specification A480/ 
A480M shall apply. The product analysis tolerance is not 
applicable to the carbon content for material with a specified 
maximum carbon of 0.04 % or less. 
10.1.3 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be 
made. Both retests, for the elements in question, shall meet the 
requirements of this specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot shall be rejected, or at the option of 
the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or tube may be 
individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat-rolled stock 
or tubes that do not meet the requirements of this specification 
shall be rejected. 
11. Mechanical Requirements 
11.1 Tensile Properties: 
11.1.1 The material shall conform to the tensile properties 
shown in Table 2.

of such material shall be a matter for agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
18. Certification 
18.1 A test report, signed by an authorized employee or 
representative of the manufacturer, shall be furnished to the 
purchaser to indicate the specification and grade, seamless or 
welded, the results of the heat analysis, hardness and tensile 
properties. Product analysis will be reported only when re­
quested on the purchase order as provided in 4.1.7. 
19. Product Marking 
19.1 All tubes shall be marked with the heat number. 
19.2 Containers and packages shall be marked or tagged to 
show the purchaser's order number, the manufacturer's order 
number, specification, seamless or welded, grade, size and wall 
thickness, minimum or average, number of pieces contained in 
the package, and item number (if appropriate). 
20. Packaging 
20.1 All tubing shall be packaged and blocked in such a 
manner as to prevent damage in ordinary handling and trans­
portation. The boxes shall be constructed in such a manner that 
no nails, staples, screws, or similar fasteners are required to 
close and secure the box after the tubes have been placed in the 
box. The box shall be lined with plastic sheet or vapor barrier 
materials so as to prevent chloride contamination of the tube 
during handling, transportation, and storage. 
20.2 The U-bent tubes shall be arranged in boxes so that the 
smaller radius bends may be removed without disturbing larger 
radius bends. Tubes for an item number shall be boxed 
together. 
21. Keywords 
21.1 austenitic stainless steel; feedwater heater tubes; seam­
less tube; stainless steel tube; steel tube; welded steel tube 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirement or requirements may become a part of the specification 
when specified in the inquiry or invitation to bid, and purchase order or contract. These requirements 
shall not be considered, unless specified in the order, in which event the necessary tests shall be made 
by the manufacturer prior to the bending or shipment of the tubing. 
Sl. Nondestructive Eddy-Current Test 
S 1.1 Each tube in the finished condition, except for bending 
if that is required, shall be tested by passing it through an 
electric nondestructive tester capable of detecting defects on 
the entire cross section of the tube. Suitable instrumentation 
shall be used to clearly distinguish the artificial defects. The 
outside and inside surfaces of the tubes shall be free of loose 
scale, metallic particles, or other material which would tend to 
restrict signals or create electrical noise. The tubing shall be 
inspected by feeding it longitudinally through an inspection 
coil or coils with a diameter suitable for the diameter of tubing 
to be inspected. The instrument calibration shall be accom­
plished with a reference standard prepared from an appropriate 
length of selected tubing of the same size, grade, and physical 
condition as the material to be inspected. The standard shall be 
fed through the coil at the same speed at which the inspection 
of the tubing is performed. 
S1.2 The factors listed in S1.3 shall be selected or adjusted, 
or both, in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's 
instructions, for the particular instrument involved as required 
to achieve optimum instrument distinction between the refer­
ence defects and plain portions of the tube. 
S1.3 The following as well as other factors involved shall 
not be used in such a manner that they detract from the overall 
ability of the instrument to detect defects: test frequency, 
direct-current saturation level, filter networks, phase-analysis 
circuits, coil diameter, and instrument gain. 
S1.4 The reference standard shall consist of a defect-free 
sample of the same size, alloy, and condition (temper) as that 
being tested, and shall contain longitudinal and circumferential 
notches on the outside diameter establishing the rejection level 
of the tubing to be tested. Inside diameter notches, both 
longitudinal and transverse, shall also be a part of the reference 
standard. These inside notches may be larger than the outside 
notches, and are intended for use only to assure instrument 
phase settings capable of yielding optimum inside surface 
sensitivity. 
S1.4.1 All notches shall be produced by EDM methods. The 
outside diameter notches shall be of the dimensions shown in 
Table S 1.1 and Fig. S 1. 1. 
S 1.5 All tubing shall meet this specification. The instrument 
calibration shall be verified at the start of testing, after any shut 
down of the test equipment, after any test equipment 
adjustment, or at least every ½ h of continuous production 
testing or both. Tubes generating a signal above the outside 
diameter calibration standard sensitivity level shall be rejected.

SA-693 (ASTM A693) ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 
a Designation: A693 - 22 
~u II 
INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Precipitation-Hardening Stainless and Heat-Resisting Steel 
Plate, Sheet, and Strip 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A693; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year of 
original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A 
superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers precipitation-hardening stain­
less steel plate, sheet, and strip. The mechanical properties of 
these steels are developed by suitable low-temperature heat 
treatments generally referred to as precipitation hardening. 
1.2 These steels are used for parts requiring corrosion 
resistance and high strength at room temperature or at tem­
peratures up to 600 °F (315 °C). Some of these steels are 
particularly suitable for moderate to severe drawing and 
forming in the solution-treated condition. Others are capable of 
mild forming only. They are suitable for machining in the 
solution-annealed condition, after which they may be hardened 
to the mechanical properties specified in this standard without 
danger of cracking or distortion. 
1.3 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as the standard. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical

4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Melting Process-The steel shall be made by open­
hearth or electric-furnace process, with or without separate 
refining such as argon-oxygen-decarburization (AOD), unless 
otherwise designated by the individual specification. 
4.2 Heat Treatment: 
4.2.1 Ferritic and martensitic steel shall be cooled after 
pouring to provide substantially complete transformation of 
austenite prior to heat treatment to enhance mechanical prop­
erties. 
4.2.2 Castings shall be heat treated in the working zone of a 
fumace that has been surveyed in accordance with Test Method 
A991/A991M. 
4.2.2.1 When castings are heat treated at temperatures 
above 2000 °F [1100 °C], then the working zone shall have 
been established by a survey performed at not more than 25 °F 
[15 °C] below nor more than 200 °F [110 °C] above the 
minimum heat treatment temperature specified for the grade. If 
a minimum heat treatment temperature is not specified for the 
grade, then the survey temperature shall be not more than 50 °F 
1153

SA-703/SA-703M ASME BPVC.ll.A-2025 
[30 °C] below nor more than 175 °F [100 °C] above the 
furnace set point used. 
4.2.2.2 The maximum variation in measured temperature as 
determined by the difference between the highest temperature 
and the lowest temperature shall be as agreed between the 
purchaser and producer, except that during production heat 
treatment no portion of the furnace shall be below the 
minimum specified temperature nor above the maximum 
specified temperature for the grade being processed. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Chemical Analysis-Chemical analysis of materials 
covered by this specification shall be in accordance with Test 
Methods A751. 
5.2 Heat Analysis-An analysis of each heat shall be made 
by the manufacturer to determine the percentages of the 
elements specified. The analysis shall be made from a test 
sample preferably taken during the pouring of the heat. When 
drillings are used, they shall be taken not less than ¼ in. 
[6.4 mm] beneath the surface. The chemical composition thus 
determined shall be reported to the purchaser, or their 
representative, and shall conform to the requirements in the 
individual specification for the grade being poured. 
5.3 Product Analysis-A product analysis may be made by 
the purchaser from material representing each heat, lot, or 
casting. The analysis shall be made on representative material. 
Due to the possibility of decarburization, samples for carbon 
analysis shall be taken no closer than ¼ in. [6.4 mm] to a cast 
surface, except that castings too thin for this shall be analyzed 
on representative material. The chemical composition thus 
determined shall meet the requirements specified in the appli­
cable specification for the grade involved, or shall be subject to 
rejection by the purchaser, except that the chemical composi­
tion determined for carbon and low-alloy steel and stainless 
steel castings may vary from the specified limits by the 
amounts shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The 
product analysis tolerances of Tables 1 and 2 are not applicable 
as acceptance criteria for heat analysis by the casting manu­
facturer. When comparing product and heat analysis for other 
thari carbon and low-alloy steels and stainless steels, the 
reproducibility data R 2 , in Test Methods E353 or E354, as 
applicable, shall be taken into consideration .. 
5.4 Unspecified Elements-When chemical analysis for el­
ements not specified for the grade ordered is desired, Supple­
mentary Requirement S 1 may be specified. 
5.5 Grade Substitution-Grade substitution is not permitted. 
Grade substitution occurs when the material being supplied 
contains one or more elements that are not specified for the 
supplied material such that the material conforms to the 
requirements of a different grade. 
5.6 Where more than one ladle is poured into a single 
casting, the molten metal in each ladle must conform to the 
specified chemical requirements. 
6. Mechanical Test Methods 
6.1 All mechanical tests shall be conducted in accordance 
with Test Methods and Definitions A370. When material is

A The range denotes the composition limits up to which the tolerances are 
computed by the equation, and above which the tolerances are given by a 
constant. 
8 The subscript L for the elements In each equation indicates that the limits of the 
element specified by the applicable specification are to be inserted into the 
equation to calculate the tolerance for the upper limlt and the lower limit, if 
applicable, respectively. Examples of computing tolerances are presented In the 
footnote C. 
0 To compute the tolerances, consider the manganese limits 0.50 - 80 % of Grade 
WC4 of Specification A217/A217M. In accordance with Table 1, the maximum 
permissible deviation of a product analysis below the lower limit 0.50 is 0.05 % = 
(0.08 x 0.50 + 0.01 ). The lowest acceptable product analysis of Grade WC4, 
therefore, is 0.45 %. Similarly, the maximum permissible deviation above the 
upper limit of 0.80 % is 0.074 % = (0.08 x 0.80 + 0.01). The highest acceptable 
product analysis of Grade WC4, therefore, is 0.874. For Grade wee of Specifi­
cation A216/A216M, the maximum manganese content is 1.40 % if the carbon 
content is 0.20 %. In this case, the highest acceptable product analysis is 1.49 = 
(1.40 + 0.09). 
ordered to an M-suffix (SI units) standard, then in accordance 
with Test Methods A1058. 
6.2 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test 
Methods Al058 when material is ordered to an M-su:ffix (SI 
units) product standard, should be identified by the purchaser 
in the ordering information. If the choice of test track is not 
specified in the. order, then the default ASTM tr.ack shall be 
used as noted in Test Methods A1058. 
7. Tensile Requirements 
7 .1 One tension test shall be made from each heat, and shall 
conform to the tensile requirements specified. Test coupons 
shall be cast from the same heat as the castings represented, 
except that for investment castings, the test coupons shall be 
cast in the same type of mold as the castings.

7.2 The coupon from which the test specimen is taken shall 
be heat treated in production furnaces to the same procedure as 
the castings it represents. 
7.3 Test specimens may be cut from heat-treated castings, at 
the producer's option, instead of from test coupons. 
7.4 Investment Castings-For investment castings, the cou­
pons may be cast to shape or machined from coupons to 
dimensions in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions 
A370 or the ICI coupon shown in Specification A1067/ 
A1067M, Fig. 1. 
7.5 Other Castings-Unless otherwise specified by the 
purchaser, test coupons may be cast integrally with the castings 
or separately in accordance with Specification A1067 / 
A1067M, Fig. 1 and Table 1, with Fig. 2, or with Fig. 4, except 
when Supplementary Requirement S26 is specified. The test 
coupon in Specification A1067/Al067M, Fig. 4 shall be 
employed only for austenitic alloy castings with cross sections 
less than 2½ in. [63.5 mm]. Tension test specimens shall be 
prepared in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions 
A370 or Test Methods Al058 as applicable. 
7.6 To determine conformance with the tension test 
requirements, an observed value or calculated value shall be 
rounded off in accordance with Practice E29 to the nearest 
500 psi [5 MPa] for yield and tensile strength and to the nearest 
1 % for elongation and reduction of area. 
8. Repair by Welding 
8.1 Repair by welding shall be in accordance with the 
requirements of individual specification using procedures and 
welders qualified in accordance with Practice A488/A488M. 
9. Flanges 
9.1 When a flange from a flanged casting is removed to

10. Quality 
10.1 The surface of the casting shall be free of adhering 
sand, scale, cracks, and hot tears as determined by visual 
examination. Other surface discontinuities shall meet the visual 
acceptance standards specified in the order. Practice A802/ 
A802M or other visual standards may be used to define 
acceptable surface discontinuities and finish. Unacceptable 
visual surface discontinuities shall be removed and their 
removal verified by visual examination of the resultant cavi­
ties. 
10.2 The castings shall not be peened, plugged, or impreg­
nated to stop leaks or disguise rejectable indications. 
10.3 Internal chills and chaplets may be used in the manu­
facture of castings. However, the chills, chaplets, and affected 
cast material must be completely removed. 
11. Hydrostatic Tests 
11.1 Each casting shall be tested after machining to the 
hydrostatic shell test pressures prescribed in ANSI B16.5 for 
the applicable steel rating for which the casting is designed. 
Casting shall show no leaks. Castings ordered for working 
pressures other than those in the standard ANSI ratings, or 
those listed for which test pressures are not specified by ANSI 
B16.5, shall be tested at a pressure agreed upon between 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
11.2 It is realized that the foundry may be unable to perform 
the hydrostatic test prior to shipment, or that the purchaser may 
wish to defer testing until additional work or machining has 
been performed on the casting. Castings ordered in the rough 
state for final machining by the purchaser may be tested 
hydrostatically prior to shipment by the manufacturer at 
pressures to be agreed upon with the purchaser. However, the 
foundry is responsible for the satisfactory performance of the 
castings under the final test required in 11. 1. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 All castings shall be made in a workmanlike manner 
and shall conform to the dimensions on drawings furnished by 
the purchaser. When the pattern is supplied by the purchaser, 
the dimensions of the casting shall be as predicated by the 
pattern unless otherwise agreed upon. 
12.2 Machined welding ends shall be suitably protected 
against damage during shipping. 
13. Retests 
13.1 If a specimen is machined improperly or if flaws are 
revealed by machining or during testing, the specimen may be 
discarded and another substituted from the same heat. 
13.2 If the results of the mechanical tests for any heat, lot, 
or casting do not conform to the requirements specified, 
castings may be reheat treated and retested. When castings are 
reheat treated, they may not be re-austenitized more than three 
times without the approval of the purchaser. Testing after 
reheat treatment shall consist of the full number of specimens 
taken from locations complying with the specification or order. 
NoTE 1-Test Methods and Definitions A370, paragraph 4.4 and Test 
Methods A1058, paragraph 3.5 address retesting because of mechanical 
reasons such as failure of the test equipment. Test Methods and Definitions 
A370, paragraph 14.4.2 addresses retesting for reasons such as fracture 
outside of the middle half of the gauge length or at a punch mark. 
14. Inspection 
14.1 The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's inspector 
all reasonable facilities necessary to satisfy that the material is 
being produced and furnished in accordance with the appli­
cable specification. Foundry inspection by the purchaser shall 
not interfere unnecessarily with the manufacturer's operations. 
All tests and inspections, with the exception of product 
analysis (5.2), shall be made at the place of manufacture unless 
otherwise agreed. 
15. Rejection and Rehearing 
15.1 Any rejection based on test reports shall be reported to 
the manufacturer within 30 days from the receipt of the test 
reports by the purchaser. 
15.2 Material that shows unacceptable discontinuities as 
determined by the acceptance standards specified in the order 
subsequent to its acceptance at the manufacturer's works will 
be rejected, and the manufacturer shall be notified within 
30 days after discovery of the rejectable condition. 
15.3 Samples that represent rejected material shall be pre­
served for two weeks from the date of transmission of the test 
report. In case of dissatisfaction with the results of the tests, the 
manufacturer may make claim for a rehearing within that time. 
16. Certification 
16.1 The manufacturer's certification shall be furnished to 
the purchaser stating that the material was manufactured, 
sampled, tested, and inspected in accordance with the material 
specification (including year of issue) and was found to meet 
the requirements. When the purchaser imposes the require­
ments of this specification, the manufacturer is responsible for 
compliance with the specification requirements during the 
production and processing of the casting by themselves and 
any of their subcontractors. 
16.2 As applicable, the certification shall also include: 
16.2.1 Material specification and grade, 
16.2.2 Pattern number, 
16.2.3 Heat number or serial number traceable to a heat 
number, 
16.2.4 Chemical analysis of the heat, 
16.2.5 Mechanical property results required by the specifi­
cation and supplementary requirements specified in the pur­
chase order, 
16.2.6 Statement of satisfactory inspection, visual, and non-
destructive testing specified in the purchase order, 
16.2.7 Manufacturer's name, and 
16.2.8 Additional purchase order requirements. 
16.3 A signature is not required on the certification. 
However, the document shall clearly identify the organization 
submitting the certification. Notwithstanding the absence of a 
signature, the organization submitting the certification is re­
sponsible for its content.

16.4 A manufacturer's certification printed from or used in 
electronic form from an electronic data interchange (EDI) 
transmission shall be regarded as having the same validity as a 
counterpart printed in the certifier's facility, provided it con­
forms to any existing EDI agreement between the purchaser 
and the supplier. 
17. Product Marking 
17 .1 Castings shall be marked for material identification 
with grade symbols (WCB, WC9, CF8M, and so forth). In 
addition, heat numbers, or serial numbers that are traceable to 
heat numbers, shall be marked on all pressure-containing 
castings individually weighing 50 lb [22. 7 kg] or more. 
Pressure-containing castings weighing less than 50 lb [22.7 kg] 
shall be marked with either the heat number or a lot number 
that will identify the casting as to the month in which it was 
poured. Marking shall be in such position as not to injure the 
usefulness of the casting. 
17 .2 On castings for which impact property requirements 
are specified, stamped markings using low-stress stamps shall 
be on a raised pad when such pad can be made a part of the 
castings. 
17.3 Castings shall be marked with the manufacturer's 
identification or symbol except when other provisions have 
been made between the manufacturer and purchaser.

to 1 0 000 lb [4.5 tonnes]; 
(2) Exceeds 20 in. 2 [130 cm 2 ] for castings weighing from 10 000 lb 
to 30 000 lb [4.5 to 13.5 tonnes]; 
(3) Exceeds approximately 30 in.2 [200 cm 2 ] for pieces weighing 
more than 30 000 lb [13.5 tonnes]. 
shall be documented. 
S20.2 Weld repairs requiring documentation shall be docu­
mented on sketches or photographs, or both. The sketches or 
photographs shall show the location and major dimensions of 
cavities prepared for weld repair. The weld repair documenta­
tion shall be submitted to the purchaser at the completion of the 
order. 
S21. Heat Treatment Furnace Record 
S21.1 A heat treatment chart showing time and temperature 
shall be prepared and be available for inspection by the 
purchaser. 
S22. Heat Treatment 
S22.1 Test specimens shall be heat treated together with the 
castings they represent. Heat-treated specimens shall be tested 
and shall meet the tensile and impact properties specified. 
S22.2 The remaining test specimens from Supplementary 
Requirement S22.1 representing the casting shall be treated 
thermally after the final (foundry) heat treatment to simulate 
heat treatments below the critical temperature that the casting 
may receive during fabrication, and then tested for mechanical 
properties. Time, temperature, and cooling rate shall be as 
stated in the order. In the case of post-weld heat treatment, the 
total time at temperature or temperatures for the test material 
shall be at least 80 % of the total time at temperature or 
temperatures during actual post-weld heat treatment of the 
fabrication of which the casting or castings are a part. The total 
time at temperature or temperatures for the test material may be 
performed in a single cycle. When this supplementary require­
ment is specified, the welding qualification test metal must be 
processed in the same manner. 
S23. Macroetch Test 
S23.l Apply Supplementary Requirement SI for the spec­
trographic determination and reporting of the total residual 
aluminum content of all heats of ferritic and martensitic steels 
subjected to this macroetch test. 
S23.2 When the heat analysis indicates a total residual 
aluminum content in excess of 0.08 %, the manufacturer shall 
etch a cross section of the casting with the heaviest section for 
which this supplementary requirement is invoked, or a coupon 
attached to that heaviest section or an area directly under a riser 
(Note S23.l). Cross sections, from a separately cast test block 
from the same heat and of a thickness representative of the 
heaviest section of castings purchased under this supplemen­
tary requirement, may also be used for macroetch testing. The 
etching shall be performed on the selected section after its heat 
treatment, that is, after heat treatment as defined in the product 
specification. 
NoTE S23.1-High-strength martensitic castings, in particular, may be 
damaged beyond use if the etch is applied directly to the casting. 
S23.3 The preparation of the surface and the macroetching 
procedure with solution No. 1 (1:1 HCl) of Table 5 in Practice 
E340 shall be followed. The resulting etched surface shall be 
compared and rated with the reference photographs in Fig. 
S23.1 depicting ten levels of severity of intergranular network 
structures indicative of the presence of aluminum nitride, or 
other constituents prone toward precipitating at grain bound­
aries during solidification and subsequent cooling. Table S23.1 
relates the severity levels shown in these photographs with 
specific delineation widths and percent of boundary outlining 
in the etched structures. 
S23.4 Castings represented by etched structures exhibiting a 
network rating in excess of Severity Level 4 shall be consid­
ered unacceptable until further evaluations are completed. The 
acceptability of individual castings may be determined by 
etching sections of each casting to ascertain the network 
severity ,level. Disposition of unacceptable castings shall be a 
matter of agreement between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
Those castings exhibiting etched severity levels greater than 
four may be further evaluated by any of the following 
agreed-upon methods: 
S23.4.1 Fracture testing to determine the amount of "rock 
candy" structure. 
S23.4.2 Mechanical testing (bend, tensile, and so forth) to 
determine the ductility characteristics. 
S23.4.3 Weld testing to determine crack susceptibility in the 
heat-affected zone of a circular groove welded with cellulose 
coated electrodes. 
S23.5 Alternatively, by agreement, it is permissible to 
subject castings from an unacceptable heat to a high­
temperature homogenizing cycle prior to the normal produc­
tion heat treatment and subsequently macroetch test each 
casting. 
S23.6 Heavy section castings (3) whose configurations are 
amenable to the attachment of test coupons representative of 
the section thickness involved and from which standard 0.505-
in. [12.827-mrn] diameter tension specimens may be machined 
are exempt from this macroetch test if the results of the tension 
test on the coupon after heat treatment of the casting meet the 
minimum requirements specified for the grade of steel in­
volved. 
NoTE S23.2-For purposes of this supplementary requirement, a heavy 
section casting is defined as one having a wall thickness of 1 ½ in. 
[37 mm] or greater in combination with a casting weight of at least 
1000 lb [455 kg]. 
S24. Specified Ferrite Content Range 
S24.1 The chemical composition of the heat shall be con­
trolled such that the ferrite content, as determined by the 
chemical composition procedure of Practice A800/ A800M, 
shall be in accordance with the specified ferrite content range. 
S24.2 The specified ferrite content range shall be as agreed 
upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. The mini­
mum specified ferrite content range shall be 10 %, with the 
minimum ferrite content being no lower than the percent 
necessary to achieve the minimum mechanical properties 
required for the alloy.

ment Sl or S2 of Practice A800/A800M. 
S25. Heat Treatment Certification 
S25.l Heat treatment temperature and cycle times shall be 
shown on the certification report. 
S26. Alternate Tension Test Coupons and Specimen Loca­
tions for Castings 
S26. l Test coupons may be cast integrally with the castings 
or separately. Separately cast coupons shall be heat treated 
together with the castings they represent. 
S26.2 The casting thickness, T, is the maximum thickness of 
the pressure-containing wall of the casting exclusive of pad­
ding added for directional solidification, flanges, appendages, 
and sections designated by the designer as noncritical. The 
order, inquiry, and drawing shall designate what the test 
dimension, T, is for the casting. 
S26.3 One of the following shall apply: 
S26.3.l The longitudinal centerline of the test specimen 
shall be taken at least ¼ T from the T dimension surface and all 
of the gage length must· be at least 1 T from any other 
heat-treated surface, exclusive of the surface opposite the T 
dimension surface. (See Specification Al067/Al067M, Fig. 5 
(a).) For cylindrical castings, the longitudinal centerline of the 
specimens shall be taken at least ¼ T from the outside or inside 
and all of the gage length must be at least T from the 
as-heat-treated end. (See Specification Al067/Al067M, Fig. 5 
(b).) 
S26.3.2 For ferritic and martensitic castings, partial sever­
ing of test coupons prior to final heat treatment is permitted. 
S26.3.3 Where separately cast test coupons are used, the 
dimension shall not be less than 3 T by 3 T by T and each 
specimen shall meet the requirements of S26.3.l, except that 
1160

=== Page 1247 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-703/SA-703M 
when T exceeds 5 in. [125 mm], the dimension may be 15 by 
15 by 5 in. [375 by 375 by 125 mm], by agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. The test coupon shall be of the 
same heat of steel and shall receive substantially the same 
casting practices as the production casting it represents. Cen­
trifugal castings may be represented by statically cast coupons. 
(See Specification Al067/Al067M, Fig. 6.) 
S26.3.4 When agreed upon between the manufacturer and 
the purchaser, castings that are cast or machined to essentially 
the finished configuration prior to heat treatment shall have test 
specimens removed from a prolongation or other stock on the 
casting at a location below the nearest heat-treated surface 
indicated on the order. The specimen location shall be at a 
distance below the nearest heat-treated surface equivalent to at 
least the greatest distance that the indicated high-tensile-stress 
surface will be from the nearest heat-treated surface and a 
minimum of twice this distance from a second heat-treated 
surface, except that the test specimens shall be no nearer than 
¾ in. [19 mm] to a heat-treated surface and 1 ½ in. [38 mm] 
from a second heat-treated surface. (See Specification Al067/ 
Al067M, Fig. 7.) 
S26.3.5 Where specimens are to be removed from the body 
of quenched and tempered castings, either the requirements of 
S26.3.1 shall be met or a steel thermal buffer pad or thermal 
insulation or other thermal barriers shall be used during heat 
treatment. Steel thermal buffer pads shall be a minimum of T 
by T by 3 T in length and shall be joined to the casting surface 
by a partial penetration weld completely sealing the buffered 
surface. Test specimens shall be removed from the casting in a 
location adjacent to the center third of the buffer pad. They 
shall be located at a minimum distance of½ in. [13 mm] from 
the buffered surface and ¼ T from other heat-treated surfaces 
(see Specification Al067/Al067M, Fig. 7). When thermal 
insulation is used, it shall be applied adjacent to the casting 
surface where the test specimens are to be removed. The 
producer shall demonstrate that the cooling rate of the test 
specimen location is no faster than that of specimens taken by 
the method described in S26.3.1 
S27. Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIPing) 
S27 .1 Castings shall be processed by hot isostatic pressing 
(HIPing) according to Practice Al080. Unless specified by the 
purchaser in the purchase order or contract, the HIPing time, 
temperature, pressure, and other parameters shall be at the 
discretion of the producer. 
S28. Cleaning of Stainless Steels 
S28.1 Final cleaning of the casting surfaces shall be per­
formed in accordance with one of the cleaning methods in 
Practice A380/A380M or Specification A967/A967M as 
agreed upon between the purchaser and supplier. Acceptance 
testing shall be subject to agreement between the purchaser and 
supplier.

Xl. ALLOY DESIGNATIONS FOR CAST STAINLESS STEELS 
Xl.1 Cast stainless steels are usually specified on the basis 
of composition using the alloy designation system established 
by the Alloy Casting Institute (ACI). The ACI designations, for 
example, CF8M, have been adopted by ASTM and are pre­
ferred for cast alloys over the designations used by the 
American Iron and Steel Institute for similar wrought steels. 
Xl .2 This nomenclature system has served successfully to 
accommodate changes in old alloys and to designate new ones. 
xxooxxx 
~~-=:on_J J J 111 Carbon Content Number _________ __,_ 
Special elements 1.4!1.ter ______________ ._~ 
Xl.2.1 Service Classification Letter-The first letter of the 
cast stainless steel designation system identifies the intended 
service application of the alloy. The letter C indicates 
corrosion-resistant service, and the letter H indicates the 
heat-resistant service at and above 1200 °F [649 °C]. 
Xl.2.2 Ternary Diagram Location Letter-The second let­
ter indicates the approximate location of the nickel and 
chromium contents of the alloy grade on the FeCrNi ternary 
diagram shown in Fig. Xl.l. 
Xl.2.3 Carbon Content Number-For C service 
classifications, this single or dual-digit numeral represents the 
maximum carbon content in units of 0.01 %. For H service 
classifications, this number represents the midpoint of the 
range of carbon content in terms of 0.01 % with a ±0.05 % 
limit. 
Xl .2.4 Special Elements Letter-Additional letters follow­
ing the numeral represent special chemical elements in the 
alloy grade, such as M for molybdenum, C for columbium (Nb 
for niobium), Mn for manganese, S for silicon, N for nitrogen, 
Cu for copper, and W for tungsten. There are two exceptions: 
the letter A indicates "Controlled Ferrite," and the letter F 
indicates "Free Machining." 
Xl.3 In Fig. Xl.l, unlettered NiCr ranges are associated 
with the nearest lettered location. They may be the result of 
differences between corrosion and heat-resistant types or be­
cause of the influence of additional elements; for example, the 
precipitation hardening grade CB- 7Cu.
