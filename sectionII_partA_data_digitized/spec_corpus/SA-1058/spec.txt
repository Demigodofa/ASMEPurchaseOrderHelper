Test Methods for 
Mechanical Testing of Steel Products-Metric 
1. Scope 
1. 1 These test methods cover mechanical tests described in 
ASTM, EN, ISO, and ITS standards that utilize the SI system 
of units. The test methods in each system are not exact 
equivalents. Each standards system (ASTM, EN, ISO, and ITS) 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining require­
ments from any two or more systems may result in noncon­
formance with the purchase order. 
1.2 These test methods cover procedures for the mechanical 
testing of steels, stainless steels, and related alloys. The various 
mechanical tests herein described are used to determine prop­
erties required in the product specifications. Variations in 
testing methods are to be avoided, and standard methods of 
testing are to be followed to obtain reproducible and compa­
rable results. In those cases in which the testing requirements 
for certain products are unique or at variance with these general 
procedures, the product specification testing requirements shall 
control. 
1.3 Only one of the testing procedure tracks shall be 
followed: ASTM, EN, ISO, or ITS. When a test method or 
practice is not available in one of the tracks then an appropriate 
test method or practice from an alternative track shall be used. 
The respective tests are listed in the column shown in Table 1. 
NOTE 1-The test methods in each system are not exact equivalents. 
1.4 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as 
standard. No other units of measurement are included in this 
standard. 
1.5 Attention is directed to Practice ISO 17025 when there 
may be a need for information on criteria for evaluation of 
testing laboratories. 
1.6 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Precautions 
3.1 The ASTM track is the default track; if other than the 
ASTM track is used that track shall be reported. 
3.2 Certain methods of fabrication, such as bending, 
forming, and welding, or operations involving heating, may 
affect the properties of the material under test. Therefore, the 
product specifications cover the stage of manufacture at which 
mechanical testing is to be performed. The properties shown by 
testing prior to fabrication may not necessarily be representa­
tive of the product after it has been completely fabricated. 
3.3 Improper machining or preparation of test specimens 
may give erroneous results. Care should be exercised to assure 
good workmanship in machining. Improperly machined speci­
mens should be discarded and other specimens substituted. 
3.4 Flaws in the specimen may also affect results. If any test 
specimen develops flaws, the retest provision of the applicable 
product specification shall govern. 
3 .5 If any test specimen fails because of mechanical reasons 
such as failure of testing equipment or improper specimen 
preparation, it may be discarded and another specimen taken. 
4. Orientation of Test Specimens 
4.1 The terms "longitudinal test" and "transverse test" are 
used only in material specifications for wrought products and 
are not applicable to castings. When such reference is made to 
a test coupon or test specimen, the following definitions apply: 
4.1.1 Longitudinal Test, unless specifically defined 
otherwise, signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is 
parallel to the direction of the greatest extension of the steel 
during rolling or forging. The stress applied to a longitudinal 
tension test specimen is in the direction of the greatest 
extension, and the axis of the fold of a longitudinal bend test 
specimen is at right angles to the direction of greatest exten­
sion. 
4.1.2 Transverse Test, unless specifically defined otherwise, 
signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is at right 
angles to the direction of the greatest extension of the steel 
during rolling or forging. The stress applied to a transverse 
tension test specimen is at right angles to the greatest 
extension, and the axis of the fold of a transverse bend test 
specimen is parallel to the greatest extension. 
4.2 The terms "radial test" and "tangential test" are used in 
material specifications for some wrought circular products and 
are not applicable to castings .. When such reference is made to 
a test coupon or test specimen, the following definitions apply: 
4.2.1 Radial Test, unless specifically defined otherwise, 
signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is perpen­
dicular to the axis of the product and coincident with one of the 
radii of a circle drawn with a point on the axis of the product 
as a center. 
4.2.2 Tangential Test, unless specifically defined otherwise, 
signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is perpen­
dicular to a plane containing the axis of the product and tangent 
to a circle drawn with a point on the axis of the product as a 
center.

TENSION TEST 
5. Description 
5.1 The tension test related to the mechanical testing of steel 
products subjects a machined or full-section specimen of the 
material under examination to a measured load sufficient to 
cause rupture. The resulting properties sought are defined in 
Test Methods E8/E8M, ISO 6892-1, or JIS Z 2241 as appli­
cable. 
5.2 In general, the testing equipment and methods are given 
in Test Methods E8/E8M, ISO 6892-1, and JIS Z 2241. 
However, there are certain exceptions to these practices; these 
exceptions are covered in this standard. 
6. Testing Apparatus and Operations 
6.1 Loading Systems-There are two general types of load­
ing systems, mechanical (screw power) and hydraulic. These 
differ chiefly in the variability of the rate of load application. 
The older screw power machines are limited to a small number 
of fixed free running crosshead speeds. Some modern screw 
power machines, and all hydraulic machines permit stepless 
variation throughout the range of speeds. 
6.2 The tension testing machine shall be maintained in good 
operating condition, used only in the proper loading range, and 
calibrated periodically in accordance with the latest revision of 
the appropriate practices. 
NoTE 2-Many machines are equipped with stress-strain recorders for 
autographic plotting of stress-strain curves. It should be noted that some 
recorders have a load measuring component entirely separate from the 
load indicator of the testing machine. Such recorders are calibrated 
separately. 
6.3 Loading-It is the function of the gripping or holding 
device of the testing machine to transmit the load from the 
heads of the machine to the specimen under test. The essential 
requirement is that the load shall be transmitted axially. This 
implies that the centers of the action of the grips shall be in 
alignment, insofar as practicable, with the axis of the specimen 
at the beginning and during the test and that bending and 
twisting be held to a minimum. 
6.4 Speed of Testing-The speed of testing shall not be 
greater than that at which load and strain readings can be made 
accurately. In production testing, speed of testing is commonly 
expressed ( 1) in terms of free running crosshead speed (rate of 
movement of the crosshead of the testing machine when not 
under load), or (2) in terms of rate of separation of the two 
heads of the testing machine under load, or ( 3) in terms of rate 
of stressing the specimen, or ( 4) in terms of rate of straining the 
specimen. The following limitations on the speed of testing are 
recommended as adequate for most steel products: 
NOTE 3-Tension tests using closed-loop machines (with feedback 
control of rate) should not be performed using load control, as this mode 
of testing will result in acceleration of the crosshead upon yielding and 
elevation of the measured yield strength. 
6.4.1 Any convenient speed of testing may be used up to 
one half the specified yield point or yield strength. When this 
point is reached, the free-running rate of separation of the 
crossheads shall be adjusted so as not to exceed 0.025 mm per 
second per 25 mm of reduced section, or the distance between 
the grips for test specimens not having reduced sections. This 
speed shall be maintained through the yield point or yield 
strength. In determining the tensile strength, the free-running 
rate of separation of the heads shall not exceed 13 mm per min 
per 25 mm of reduced section, or the distance between the 
grips for test specimens not having reduced sections. In any 
event, the minimum speed of testing shall not be less than 1/10 
the specified maximum rates for determining yield point or 
yield strength and tensile strength. 
6.4.2 It shall be permissible to set the speed of the testing 
machine by adjusting the free running crosshead speed to the 
above specified values, inasmuch as the rate of separation of 
heads under load at these machine settings is less than the 
specified values of free running crosshead speed. 
6.4.3 As an alternative, if the machine is equipped with a 
device to indicate the rate of loading, the speed of the machine 
from half the specified yield point or yield strength through the 
yield point or yield strength may be adjusted so that the rate of 
stressing does not exceed 11 MPa per second. However, the 
minimum rate of stressing shall not be less than 1 MPa per 
second. 
7. Test Specimen Parameters 
7.1 Selection-Test coupons shall be selected in accordance 
with the applicable product specifications. 
7.2 Size and Tolerances-Test specimen dimensions and 
tolerances shall comply with the requirements of the relevant 
standards. 
7.3 Procurement of Test Specimens-Specimens shall be 
prepared from portions of the material. They are usually 
machined so as to have a reduced cross section at mid-length 
in order to obtain uniform distribution of the stress over the 
cross section and to localize the zone of fracture. Care shall be 
taken to remove by machining all distorted, cold-worked, or 
heat-affected areas from the edges of the section used in 
evaluating the test. 
7.4 Aging of Test Specimens-Unless otherwise specified, it 
shall be permissible to age tension test specimens. The time­
temperature cycle employed must be such that the effects of 
previous processing will not be materially changed. It may be 
accomplished by aging at room temperature 24 to 48 h, or in 
shorter time at moderately elevated temperatures by boiling in 
water, heating in oil or in an oven. 
7.5 Measurement of Dimensions of Test Specimens-Test 
specimens shall be measured in accordance with the require­
ments of 7.5.1 and 7.5.2 for ASTM or the appropriate para­
graphs of ISO 6892-1 or JIS Z 2241, as applicable. 
7.5.1 Rectangular Tension Test-These forms of specimens 
are shown in Test Methods E8/E8M. To determine the cross­
sectional area, the center width dimension shall be measured to 
the nearest 0.15 mm for the 200-mm gauge length specimen 
and 0.025 mm for the 50-mm gauge length specimen. The 
center thickness dimension shall be measured to the nearest 
0.025 mm for both specimens. 
7.5.2 Round Tension Test Specimens-These forms of speci­
mens are shown in Test Methods E8/E8M. To determine the 
1544

=== Page 1599 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-1058 
cross-sectional area, the diameter shall be measured at the 
center of the gauge length to the nearest 0.025 mm. 
7.6 General-Test specimens shall be either substantially 
full size or machined, as prescribed in the product specifica­
tions for the material being tested. 
7.6.1 It is desirable to have the cross-sectional area of the 
specimen smallest at the center of the gauge length to ensure 
fracture within the gauge length. This is provided for by the 
taper in the gauge length permitted for each of the specimens 
described in the following sections. 
7 .6.2 For low ductility materials it is desirable to have fillets 
of large radius at the ends of the gauge length. 
• 8. Plate-Type Specimen 
8.1 The standard plate-type test specimen is shown in Test 
Methods E8/E8M, ISO 6892-1, or JIS Z 2241. This specimen 
is used for testing metallic materials in the form of plate, 
structural and bar-size shapes, and flat material having a 
nominal thickness of 5 mm or over. When product specifica­
tions so permit, other types of specimens may be used. 
9. Sheet-Type Specimen 
9.1 The standard sheet-type test specimen is shown in Test 
Methods E8/E8M, ISO 6892-1, or JIS Z 2241. This specimen 
is used for testing metallic materials in the form of sheet, plate, 
flat wire, strip, band, and hoop ranging in nominal thickness 
from 0.13 to 19 mm. When product specifications so permit, 
other types of specimens may be used, as specified in Test 
Methods E8/E8M. 
10. Round Specimens 
10.1 The standard diameter round test specimen as shown in 
Test Methods E8/E8M, ISO 6892-1, or JIS Z 2241 is frequently 
used for testing metallic materials. 
10.2 Small size specimens proportional to standard speci­
mens may be used when it is necessary to test material from 
which the standard specimens cannot be prepared. When small 
size specimens are used, the gauge length for measurement of 
elongation shall be five times the diameter of the specimen. 
10.3 The type of specimen ends outside of the gauge length 
shall accommodate the shape of the product tested, and shall 
properly fit the holders or grips of the testing machine so that 
axial loads are applied with a minimum of load eccentricity and 
slippage. 
11. Gauge Marks 
11.1 Test specimens shall be marked in accordance with the 
requirements of the relevant standards. 
12. Determination of Tensile Properties 
12.1 The determination and description of the tensile prop­
erties shall be in accordance with the requirements of the 
relevant standards. 
12.2 Elongation values may be converted from (i) 4d gauge 
length to a 5d gauge length, or (ii) 5d gage length to a 4d gage 
length by use of the multiplication factors shown in Table 2. If 
this conversion is used, the supplier must show the calculation 
on the certification.

12.2.2 Example 2-Conversion of Austenitic steel elonga­
tion derived from 5d gauge length to a 4d gauge length 
elongation value: 
23 % X l.029 = 24 % 
12.3 Reduction of Area-Fit the ends of the fractured 
specimen together and measure the mean diameter or the width 
and thickness at the smallest cross section to the same accuracy 
as the original dimensions. The difference between the area 
thus found and the area of the original cross section expressed 
as a percentage of the original area is the reduction of area. 
BEND TEST 
13. Description 
13.1 The bend test is one method for evaluating ductility, 
but it cannot be considered as a quantitative means of predict­
ing service performance in all bending operations. The severity 
of the bend test is primarily a function of the angle of bend and 
inside diameter to which the specimen is bent, and of the cross 
section of the specimen. These conditions are varied according 
to location and orientation of the test specimen and the 
chemical composition, tensile properties, hardness, type, and 
quality of the steel specified. Test Method E190, Test Methods 
E290, EN ISO 7438, EN 10232 (tube), ISO 7438, or ISO 8491 
(tube) and JIS Z 2248 may be consulted for methods of 
performing the test. 
13.2 Unless otherwise specified, it shall be pennissible to 
age bend test specimens. The time-temperature cycle employed 
must be such that the effects of previous processing will not be 
materially changed. It may be accomplished by aging at room 
temperature 24 to 48 h, or in shorter time at moderately 
elevated temperatures by boiling in water or by heating in oil 
or in an oven. 
13.3 Bend the test specimen at room temperature to an 
inside diameter, as designated by the applicable product 
specifications, to the extent specified. The speed of bending is 
ordinarily not an important factor. 
HARDNESS TEST 
14. General 
14.1 A hardness test is a means of determining resistance to 
penetration and is occasionally employed to obtain a quick 
approximation of tensile strength. Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, 
and Table 6 are for the conversion of hardness measurements 
from one scale to another or to approximate tensile strength.

A This table gives the approximate interrelationships of hardness values and approximate tensile strength of steels. It is possible that steels of various compositions and 
processing histories will deviate in hardness-tensile strength relationship from the data presented in this table. The data in this table should not be used for austenitic 
stainless steels, but have been shown to be applicable for ferritic and martensitic stainless steels. The data in this table should not be used to establish a relationship 
between hardness values and tensile strength of hard drawn wire. Where more precise conversions are required, they should be developed specially for each steel 
composition, heat treatment, and part.

15.1.1 A range of hardness can properly be specified only 
for quenched and tempered or normalized and tempered 
material. For annealed material a maximum figure only should 
be specified. For normalized material a minimum or a maxi­
mum hardness may be specified by agreement. In general, no 
hardness requirements should be applied to untreated material. 
15.1.2 Brinell hardness may be required when tensile prop­
erties are not specified. 
15.2 Test Specimen-Brinell hardness tests are made on 
prepared areas and sufficient metal must be removed from the 
surface to eliminate decarburized metal and other surface 
irregularities. The thickness of the piece tested must be such 
that no bulge or other marking showing the effect of the load 
appears on the side of the piece opposite the indentation. 
15.3 Procedure: 
15.3.1 It is essential that the applicable product specifica­
tions state clearly the position at which Brinell hardness 
indentations are to be made and the number of such indenta­
tions required. The distance of the center of the indentation 
from the edge of the specimen or edge of another indentation 
must be at least two and one-half times the diameter of the 
indentation. 
15.3.2 Measure two diameters of the indentation at right 
angles to the nearest 0.1 mm, estimate to the nearest 0.05 mm, 
and average to the nearest 0.05 mm. If the two diameters differ 
by more than 0.1 mm, discard the readings and make a new 
indentation. 
16. Rockwell Test

17. Portable Hardness Test 
17 .1 Although this standard generally prefers the use of 
fixed-location Brinell or Rockwell hardness test methods, it is 
not always possible to perform the hardness test using such 
equipment due to the part size, location, or other logistical 
reasons. In this event, hardness testing using portable equip­
ment as described in Test Methods A956/A956M, A1038, and 
Ell0 shall be used with strict compliance for reporting the test 
results in accordance with the selected standard (see examples 
below). Standard Practice A833 may be used, although it might 
not always be suitable as a criterion for acceptance or rejection 
since Practice A833 does not contain a precision and bias 
statement. 
17.1.1 Practice A833-The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
given the HBC designation followed by the comparative test 
bar hardness to indicate that it was determined by a portable 
comparative hardness tester, as in the following example: 
17 .1.1.1 232 HBC/2.40 where 232 is the hardness test result 
using the portable comparative test method (HBC) and 240 is 
the Brinell hardness of the comparative test bar. 
17.1.2 Practice A956/A956M: 
17 .1.2.1 The measured hardness number shall be reported in 
accordance with the standard methods and appended with a 
Leeb impact device in parenthesis to indicate that it was 
determined by a portable hardness tester, as in the following 
example: 
( 1) 350 HW where 350 is the hardness test result using the 
portable Leeb hardness test method with the HLD impact 
device. 
1549

=== Page 1604 ===

SA-1058 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
17.1.2.2 When hardness values converted from the Leeb 
number are reported, the portable instrument used shall be 
reported in parentheses, for example: 
(1) 350 HB (HLD) where the original hardness test was 
performed using the portable Leeb hardness test method with 
the HLD impact device and converted to the Brinell hardness 
value (HB). 
17 .1.3 Test Method Al 038-The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
appended with UCI in parenthesis to indicate that it was 
determined by a portable hardness tester, as in the following 
example: 
17.1.3.1 446 HV (UC/) 10 where 446 is the hardness test 
result using the portable UCI test method under a force of 10 
kgf. 
17.1.4 Test Method EJJ0: The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
appended with a IP to indicate that it was determined by a 
portable hardness tester, as follows: 
17.1.4.1 Rockwell Hardness Examples: 
( 1) 40 HRCIP where 40 is the hardness test result using the 
Rockwell C portable test method. 
(2) 72 HRBW/P where 72 is the hardness test result using 
the Rockwell B portable test method using a tungsten carbide 
ball indenter. 
17.1.4.2 Brinell Hardness Examples: 
(1) 220 HBWIP 10/3000 where 220 is the hardness test 
result using the Brinell portable test method with a ball of 
10 mm diameter and with a test force of 3000 kgf (29.42 kN) 
applied for 10 s to 15 s. 
(2) 350 HBWIP 51750 where 350 is the hardness test result 
using the Brinell portable test method with a ball of 5 mm 
diameter and with a test force of750 kgf (7.355 kN) applied for 
10 s to 15 s. 
CHARPY IMPACT TESTING 
18. Description 
18.1 The equipment, test specimen and testing procedures 
shall comply with the requirements of Test Methods E23, ISO 
148-1, or JIS Z 2242. 
19. Testing Machines 
19.1 Charpy machines used for testing steel generally have 
capacities in the 300 to 400 J energy range. Sometimes 
machines of lesser capacity are used; however, the capacity of 
the machine should be substantially in excess of the absorbed 
energy of the specimens (see Test Methods E23). The linear 
velocity at the point of impact should be in the range of 4.9 to 
5.8 mis or in accordance with ISO 148-1, or JIS Z 2242. 
20. Sampling and Number of Specimens 
20.1 Sampling: 
20.1.1 Test location and orientation should be addressed by 
the product specifications. If not, for wrought products, the test 
location shall be the same as that for the tensile specimen and 
the orientation shall be longitudinal with the notch perpendicu­
lar to the major surface of the product being tested. 
20.1.2 Number of Specimens: 
20.1.2.1 All specimens used for a Charpy impact test shall 
be taken from a single test coupon or test location. 
20.1.2.2 When the specification calls for a minimum aver­
age test result, three specimens shall be tested. 
20.1.2.3 When the specification requires determination of a 
transition temperature, eight to twelve specimens are usually 
needed. 
20.2 Type and Size: 
20.2.1 A standard full size Charpy V-notch specimen as 
shown in Test Methods E23, ISO 148-1, or JIS Z 2242 shall be 
used except as provided in the following sub-paragraphs. 
20.2.2 If a standard full-size specimen cannot be prepared, 
the largest feasible standard subsize specimen shall be pre­
pared. The specimens shall be machined so that the specimen 
does not include material nearer to the surface than 0.5 mm. 
20.2.3 Tolerances for standard subsize specimens are shown 
in Test Methods E23, ISO 148-1, or JIS Z 2242. 
20.3 Notch Preparation-The machining of the notch is 
critical, as it has been demonstrated that extremely minor 
variations in notch radius and profile, or tool marks at the 
bottom of the notch may result in erratic test data. 
21. Calibration 
21.1 Accuracy and Sensitivity-Calibrate and adjust Charpy 
impact machines in accordance with the requirements of the 
test methods used Test Methods E23, ISO 148-2, or JIS B 
7722. 
22. Conditioning-Temperature Control 
22.1 When a specific test temperature is required by the 
specification or purchaser, control the temperature of the 
heating or cooling medium within ±2 °F (1 °C). 
23. Procedure 
23.1 Individual Test Values: 
23.1.1 Impact Energy-Record the impact energy absorbed 
to the nearest J. 
23.1.2 Fracture Appearance: 
23.1.2.1 Determine the percentage of shear fracture area by 
any of the methods described in Test Methods E23, ISO 148-1, 
or JIS Z 2242. 
23.1.2.2 Determine the individual fracture appearance val­
ues to the nearest 5 % shear fracture and record the value. 
23.1.3 Lateral Expansion: 
23.1.3.1 Methods of measurement and precautions are de­
scribed in Test Methods E23. 
23.1.3.2 Measure the individual lateral expansion values to 
the nearest 0.025 mm and record the values. 
23.1.3.3 With the exception described as follows, any speci­
men that does not separate into two pieces when struck by a 
single blow may be reported as unbroken. If the specimen can 
be separated by force applied by bare hands, the specimen may 
be considered as having been separated by the blow. 
24. Interpretation of Test Result 
24.1 When the acceptance criterion of any impact test is 
specified to be a minimum average value at a given 
1550

-~ 
ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-1058 
temperature, the test result shall be the average (arithmetic 
mean) of the individual test values of three specimens from one 
test location. 
24.1.1 When a minimum average test result is specified: 
24.1.1.1 The test result is acceptable when all of the below 
are met: 
( 1) The test result equals or exceeds the specified minimum 
average (given in the specification), 
(2) The individual test value for not more than one speci­
men measures less than the specified minimum average, and 
( 3) The individual test value for any specimen measures 
not less than two-thirds of the specified minimum average. 
24.1.1.2 ff the acceptance requirements of 24.1.1.1 are not 
met, perform one retest of three additional specimens from the 
same test location. Each individual test value of the retested 
specimens shall be equal to or greater than the specified 
minimum average value. 
24.2 Test Specifying a Minimum Transition Temperature: 
24.2.1 Definition of Transition Temperature-For specifica­
tion purposes, the transition temperature is the temperature at 
which the designated material test value equals or exceeds a 
specified minimum test value. 
24.2.2 Determination of Transition Temperature: 
24.2.2.4 Accept the test result if the determined transition 
temperature is equal to or lower than the specified value. 
24.2.2.5 If the determined transition temperature is higher 
than the specified value, but not more than 12 °C higher than 
the specified value, test sufficient samples in accordance with 
Section 25 to plot two additional curves. Accept the test results 
if the temperatures determined from both additional tests are 
equal to or lower than the specified value. 
24.3 When subsize specimens are permitted or necessary, or 
both, modify the specified test requirement according to Table 
7 or test temperature according to codes such as ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code, Section Vill, Division I Table UG-
84.2, or both. Greater energies or lower test temperatures may 
be agreed upon by purchaser and supplier. 
25. Records 
25.1 The test record should contain the following informa­
tion as appropriate: 
25.1.1 Full description of material tested (that is, specifica­
tion number, grade, class or type, size, heat number). 
25.1.2 Specimen orientation with respect to the material 
axis.

24.2.2.1 Break one specimen at each of a series of tempera­
tures above and below the anticipated transition temperature 
using the procedures in Section 23. Record each test tempera­
ture to the nearest 0.5 °C. 
24.2.2.2 Plot the individual test results (J or percent shear) 
as the ordinate versus the corresponding test temperature as the 
abscissa and construct a best-fit curve through the plotted data 
points. 
24.2.2.3 If transition temperature is specified as the tem­
perature at which a test value is achieved, determine the 
temperature at which the plotted curve intersects the specified 
test value by graphical interpolation ( extrapolation is not 
permitted). Record this transition temperature to the nearest 
3 °C. If the tabulated test results clearly indicate a transition 
temperature lower than specified, it is not necessary to plot the 
data. Report the lowest test temperature for which test value 
exceeds the specified value.

ANNEX 
(Mandatory Information) 
Al. ROUNDING OF TEST DATA 
Al.1 Application 
Al.1.1 This annex shall apply to rounding test data for the 
purpose of determining conformance to product specification 
requirements. 
Al.2.3 Requirements for rounding levels for determining 
conformance to product specification requirements are given in 
Table Al. 1. Specific reported test data values shall be rounded 
to Table Al. 1 for determining conformance to product speci­
fication requirements. Al.1.1.1 This annex shall apply only when rounding is not 
specified in the product specifications. 
Al.1.1.2 Observed or calculated test results and records 
maintained by testing laboratories are not subject to this annex. 
Al.2 Method 
Al.2.4 Table Al.1 values are designed to provide unifor­
mity in determining conformance to product specification 
requirements and should be considered when rounding require­
ments are stated in product specifications. 
Al.2.1 Values shall be rounded in accordance with the rules 
of Practice E29 unless otherwise stated herein. 
A 1.2.2 In the special case of rounding the number "5" when 
no additional numbers other than "ff' follow the "5," rounding 
shall be in accordance with Practice E29 except where this 
would result in rejection of the. product. 
Al.2.5 When rounding requirements for product acceptance 
are neither stated in the product specification nor listed in Table 
Al.1, an observed or calculated value shall be rounded to the 
nearest unit in the last right hand digit used in expressing the 
specification requirement.
