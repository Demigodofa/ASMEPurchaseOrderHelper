SA-540/SA-540M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Alloy-Steel Bolting for Special Applications 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers regular and special-quality 
alloy steel bolting materials and bolting components that may 
be used for nuclear and other special applications. See Speci­
fication A962/ A962M for the definition of bolting. 
1.2 The following referenced common requirements are 
indispensable for application of this specification: Specification 
A962/ A962M. 
1.3 Supplementary requirements of an optional nature are 
provided for use at the option of the purchaser. These supple­
mentary requirements only apply when specified individually 
by the purchaser in the purchase order or contract. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units; however, unless the purchase order or contract 
specifies the applicable "M' specification designation (SI 
units), inch-pound units shall apply. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. 
2. Referenced Documents 
2.1 ASTM Standards: 
A962/ A962M Specification for Common Requirements for 
Bolting Intended for Use at Any Temperature from Cryo­
genic to the Creep Range 
E45 Test Methods for Determining the Inclusion Content of 
Steel 
3. Ordering Information 
3.1 The inquiry and orders for bolting material and bolting 
components under this specification shall include the 
following, as required, to describe the desired items ad­
equately: 
3.1.1 Grade and Class 
3.1.2 Condition (Section 5), 
3.1.3 Heat treatment (Section 6), 
3.1.4 Supplementary Requirements (Sl to S9), 
3.1.5 Reports required (Section 16), 
3.1.6 End use, and 
3.1.7 Any special requirements. 
3.2 The purchaser is referred to the listed supplementary 
requirements. 
4. Common Requirements 
4.1 Bolting materials and bolting components supplied to 
this specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci­
fication A962/ A962M. These requirements include test 
methods, finish, thread dimensions, macro etch, marking, 
certification, optional supplementary requirements, and others. 
Failure to comply with the requirements of Specification 
-----------------------------A:,~6211\~M constitutes nonconformance with this specifica-
912 
tion. In case of conflict between this specification and Speci­
fication A962/ A962M, this specification shall prevail.

5. Manufacture 
5.1 Bolting material shall be supplied hot-rolled or hot­
forged or cold-finished at the option of the producer. However, 
if desired by the purchaser, cold finishing may be specified. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 Bolting material ordered in the annealed condition shall 
have a structure suitable for machining. Such annealed material 
is not intended to be used without subsequent quenching and 
tempering as specified in 6.2. 
6.2 Bolting material ordered in the liquid-quenched and 
tempered condition shall be uniformly reheated from a tem­
perature below the cooling transformation range to the proper 
austenitizing temperature, quenched in a liquid medium under 
substantially uniform conditions, and then uniformly reheated 
for tempering. The minimum tempering temperature shall be 
850 °F [455 °C]. 
6.3 Bolting material that has been straightened after quench­
ing and tempering shall be stress relieved by reheating to a 
temperature not lower than 100 °F [55 °C] under the tempering 
temperature. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 Steels used for bolting materials shall conform to the 
chemical requirements prescribed in Table 1. 
8. Tensile Requirements 
8.1 Bolting material furnished in the annealed condition 
shall be capable of meeting the specified tensile properties for 
the class as specified in Table 2 when heat treated in accor­
dance with 6.2 and 6.3 (see Supplementary Requirement S4). 
8.2 Bolting material in the quenched and tempered or 
quenched, tempered and stress-relieved condition shall con­
form to properties shown in Table 2 for the specified class. 
9. Hardness Requirements 
9.1 The hardness shall be determined on the surface of the 
material after removal of decarburization. 
9.2 The hardness of bolting material in the annealed condi­
tion shall not be greater than 235 HBW. 
9.3 The hardness of bolting material in the quenched and 
tempered or quenched, tempered and stress-relieved condition 
shall be within the limits in Table 2 for the specified class. 
10. Impact Requirements 
10.1 Annealed bolting material after proper heat treatment 
shall be capable of meeting the impact requirements in Table 2 
or of Supplementary Requirement S8, if so specified (see 
Supplementary Requirement S4). 
10.2 Bolting material in the quenched and tempered or 
quenched, tempered, and stress-relieved condition shall con­
form to the impact requirements in Table 2, or of Supplemen­
tary Requirement S8 if so specified. 
10.3 The percent of shear (ductility or fibrous) fracture shall 
be computed. The computed value shall be recorded for all 
impact specimens. 
10.4 The amount of lateral expansion shall be measured. 
The measured value shall be recorded for all impact specimens. 
10.5 The percent shear and the amount of lateral expansion 
shall be reported for information purposes (see 16.1). 
11. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
11.1 Bolting material shall be uniform in quality and free of 
defects that would be detrimental to the intended service. If 
magnetic particle inspection for such defects is desired, 
Supplementary Requirement S6 should be specified. 
11.2 Su,face Quality-Bolting material shall be free of 
seams, laps, cracks, or other defects that are not removable 
within the machining cleanup allowance specified in Table 3.

6.2.4 Method 4 - Test specimens shall be taken from 
a representative separate test forging or bar made from the 
same heat of steel, which shall receive substantially the 
same reduction and type of hot working as the production

=== Page 1022 ===

SA-541/SA-541M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
forgings that it represents, except that a longitudinally 
forged bar may be used to represent a rolled ring of similar 
cross section. It shall be of the same nominal thickness as 
the as-quenched production forgings and shall be heat 
treated in the same furnace charge and under the same 
conditions as the production forgings. Test specimens shall 
be removed using the ¾ T by T procedure referenced in 
Method 3 with the same limitation on forging thickness 
as in 6.2.3. This method shall be limited to forgings with a 
rough machined weight of not more than 1 000 lb [ 450 kg]. 
6.3 Metal Buffers - The required distances from 
quenched surfaces may be obtained with metal buffers 
instead of integral extensions. Buffer material may be car­
bon or low-alloy steel, and shall be joined to the forging 
with a partial penetration weld that seals the buffered sur­
face. Specimens shall be located at least ½. in. [13 mm] 
from the buffered surface of the forging. Buffers shall be 
removed and the welded areas subjected to magnetic parti­
cle test to ensure freedom from cracks unless the welded 
areas are completely removed by subsequent machining. 
6.4 Samples shall be removed from forgings after the 
quenching and tempering heat treatments. This sample 
material shall be subjected to a simulated post-weld heat 
treatment if Supplementary Requirement Sl is specified. 
6.5 Orientation - For upset disk forgings, the longitu­
dinal axis of all test specimens shall be oriented in the 
tangential direction. For all other forgings, the longitudinal 
axis of the specimens shall be oriented in the direction of 
maximum working of the forging unless Supplementary 
Requirements S 11 or S 14 are imposed. 
6.6 Number of Tests: 
6.6.1 Forgings under 500 lb [230 kg] As Treated -
6.6.3 Each forging weighing over 10 000 lb 
[ 4500 kg] shall require two tension tests and two impact 
tests, located at opposite ends if the length is 1 ½. times the 
diameter or more, or 180° apart otherwise. 
7. Repair Welding 
7.1 Repair welding of forgings may be permitted, but 
only at the option of the purchaser. 
7 .2 If repair welding is pe1formed, welders and weld 
procedures shall be qualified in accordance with Section 
IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
8. Workmanship and Quality Level Requirements 
8.1 Dimensional and visual inspections shall be con­
ducted by the manufacturer. Forgings shall be free of 
cracks, thermal ruptures, or other imperfections.

Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Quenched-and­
Tempered, Chromium-Molybdenum, and Chromium­
Molybdenum-Vanadium 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers two types of2¼ Cr-1 Mo and 
three types of Cr-Mo-V alloy steel plates for use in the 
quenched-and-tempered condition, intended for the fabrication 
of welded pressure vessels and components. 
1.2 Material under this specification is available in five 
types, designated "A," "B," "C," "D," and "E." Type B is 
identical to Type A except for restrictive limits for carbon, 
phosphorus, sulfur, and nickel. The material is also available in 
five classes having the following strength levels. Type E is 
available only as Class 4 and 4a. 
Class Minimum Tensile Strength, ksi [MPa] 
1 105 [725] 
2 115 [795] 
3 95 [655] 
4 and 4a 85 [585] 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the chemical composition to meet the specified 
mechanical property requirements. 
1.4 The minimum thickness of plates is limited to 3/16 in. [5 
mm]. 
1.5 The material is intended to be suitable for fusion 
welding. Welding technique is of fundamental importance and 
it is presupposed that welding procedures will be in accordance 
with approved methods. 
1.6 These alloy steel plates in the as-rolled condition are 
sensitive to cracking during flame cutting, transit, and han­
dling. They should be shipped in the as-rolled condition only 
with the mutual agreement of the manufacturer and the 
purchaser or fabricator. 
1.7 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents, therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with this specifi­
cation. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Quenched and 
Tempered 7, 8, and 9 % Nickel 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers 7, 8, and 9 % nickel alloy 
steel plates for use in the water quenched and tempered 
condition intended for the fabrication of welded pressure 
vessels. 
1.2 Material under this specification is available in three 
types having different chemical composition as follows: 
Type Nominal Nickel Content, % 
I 9 
II 8 
Ill 7 
1.3 Plates produced under this specification are subject to 
impact testing at -320°F [-195°C] for Type I or Type III, and 
-275°F [-170°C] for Type II; or at such other temperatures as 
are agreed upon. 
1.4 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the material to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements; however, current mill practice normally 
limits this material to 2 in. [50 mm] max. 
1.5 This material is susceptible to magnetization. Use of 
magnets in handling after heat treatment should be avoided if 
residual magnetism would be detrimental to subsequent fabri­
cation or service. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.7 This standard does not purport to address_ftll_gfthe _ 
safety conc~rnS: iTany, ciisoeiated with its ~se. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

This standard is issued under the fixed designation A556/A556M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editodal change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
seamless cold-drawn carbon steel tubes including bending into 
the form of U-tubes, if specified, for use in tubular feedwater 
heaters. 
1.2 The tubing sizes covered shall be 5/s to 1 ¼-in. [15.9 to 
31.8-mm] outside diameter, inclusive, with minimnm wall 
thicknesses equal to or greater than 0.045 in. [l. l mm]. 
1.3 Optional supplementary requirements are provided, and 
when desired, shall be stated in the order. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as the standard. Within the text, 
the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
l .5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the

6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to one of the requirements as to 
chemical composition as prescribed in Table 1. 
6.2 When a grade is ordered under this specification, sup­
plying an alloy grade that specifically requires the addition of 
any element other than those listed for the ordered grade in 
Table 1 is not permitted. 
7. Product Analysis 
7.1 When requested in the purchase order, a product analy­
sis shall be made by the manufacturer or supplier from one tube 
or billet per heat. 
7 .2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional tubes or billets shall be made. Both retests for 
the elements in question shall meet the requirements of this 
specification; otherwise, all remaining material in the heat or 
lot (Note 1) shall be rejected or, at the option of the producer, 
each tube may be individually tested for acceptance. Tubes that 
do not meet the requirements of this specification shall be 
rejected. 
NoTE 1-For tension and hardness test requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall 
thickness which are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
the same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, a lot shall 
include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the same furnace

having met the requirements of this supplement. 
S2. Nondestructive Ultrasonic Test-Round Tubing (Select 
Commercial Grade) 
S2.1 The manufacturer shall test the tubing using the 
procedure outlined in Supplementary Requirement Sl, except 
for the notch depth, which shall be 5 % of wall thickness in 
depth but not less than 0.004 in. [0.10 mm]. Tolerance on depth 
shall be +0.000 in. or -0.0005 in. [0.01 mm]. 
S3. Nondestructive Eddy-Current Test 
S3.1 Each tube shall be tested after the finish heat treatment 
following the final cold-draw pass by passing through an 
electric nondestructive tester capable of detecting defects on 
the entire cross section of the tube. Suitable instrumentation 
shall be used to clearly distinguish aiiificial defects or refer­
ence notches. Tubes to be tested shall be reasonably straight 
and the outside and inside diameter surfaces shall be free of 
loose scale, metallic particles, or other material which would 
tend to restrict signals or create electlical noise. The tubing 
shall be inspected by feeding longitudinally through an inspec­
tion coil or coils of a diameter suitable for the diameter of 
tubing to be inspected. The instrument calibration shall be 
accomplished with a reference standard prepared from an 
appropriate length of selected tubing of the same size, grade, 
and physical condition as the material to be inspected. The 
standard shall be fed through the coil at the same speed at 
which the inspection of the tubing is performed. The following 
factors shall be selected or adjusted, or both, in accordance 
with the instrument manufacturer's instructions for the paiiicu­
lar instrument involved as required to achieve optimum instru­
ment distinction between the reference defects and plain 
portion of the tube. These as well as other factors involved 
shall not be used in such a manner that they detract from the 
instrument's overall ability to detect injurious defects: 
S3 .1.1 Test frequency, 
S3.l.2 Direct-current saturation level, 
S3. l.3 Filter networks, 
S3.l.4 Phase analysis circuits, 
S3.l.5 Coil diameter, and 
S3.l.6 Instrument gain. 
S3.2 The reference standard shall contain longitudinal and 
circumferential notches in the outside diameter and shall be 
used to establish the rejection level for the tubing to be tested. 
Inside diameter notches, both longitudinal and circumferential, 
shall also be a part of the reference standard. These notches 
may be larger than outside diameter notches and ai·e intended 
for use only to assure instrument phase settings capable of 
yielding optimum inside diameter surface sensitivity. The 
outside diameter reference notches shall have a depth equal to 
10 % of the wall thickness. The tolerance of the notch shall be 
±8 % or 0.0005 in. [0.01 mm], whichever is greater. Width of 
notch shall not exceed twice the depth. The length of the 
reference notches shall not exceed 0.375 in. [9.5 mm]. All 
tubing including that which may be reconditioned, provided 
the dimensional or other properties of the tubing are not 
adversely affected and provided the tubing does not show 
indications above the level determined by the outside diameter 
references, shall meet this specification provided the instru­
ment calibration is verified by indicating the standard outside 
diameter reference notches of a given lot. Tubes generating a 
signal above the calibration standard sensitivity level shall be 
rejected. Tubes may be reconditioned if not adversely affecting 
the dimensional or other properties of the tube and so tested as 
to assure a satisfactory tube within the limits of this specifica­
tion. All tubing shall be demagnetized after inspection has been 
completed.

NOTE 1 (page 1045)
NoTE 1-For tension and hardness test requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall 
thickness which are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
the same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, a lot shall 
include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the same furnace 
at the same temperature, time at heat and furnace speed. 
7.3 For referee purposes, Test Methods A751 shall be used. 
8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 Tensile Properties-The material shall conform to the 
requirements as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2, 
when pulled in full section. 
8.2 Hardness Requirements-The tubes shall not exceed the 
Rockwell Hardness shown in Table 3.

9.2 Permissible variations from the specified minimum wall 
thickness shall not exceed +20 % or -0. The wall thickness of 
the tube in U-bent section shall be not less than value 
determined by: 
t.r= T (2R)/(2R+D) 
where: 
tr = wall thickness after bending, in. [mm], 
T = specified minimum tube wall thickness, in. [mm], 
R = centerline bend radius, in. [mm], and 
D = ·nominal outside tube diameter, in. [mm]. 
(1) 
9.3 In the case of U-tubes, the length of the tube legs as 
measured from the point of tangency of the bend and the tube 
leg to the end of the tube leg shall not be less than specified, but 
may exceed the specified values by the amount given in Table 
4. The difference in lengths of the tube legs shall not be greater 
than 1/s in. [3 mm] unless otherwise specified. 
9.4 The end of any tube may depart from square by not 
more than the amount given in Table 5. 
9.5 The leg spacing measured between the points of tan­
gency of the bend to the legs shall not vary from the value (2R 
- specified tube OD) by more than 1/16 in. [1.5 mm] where R is 
the centerline bend radius. 
9.6 The bent portion of the U-tube shall be substantially 
uniform in curvature and not exceed ± 1/16 in. [ ± 1.5 rnm] of the 
normal centerline radius. - - - - - ______ 9~LP~fllli_ssible variations from the specified outside diam-

for tubing 1.0 in. [25.4 mm] to 1.25 in. [31.7 mm] inclusive. 
These tolerances do not apply to the bent p01tion of the 
U-tubes. At the bent portion of a U-tube for R = 2 x D or 
greater neither the major nor minor diameter of tube shall 
deviate from nominal by more than 10 %. If 1 ½Dis specified, 
tolerances could be greater.

10.1 Finished tubes shall be free from scale but may have a 
superficial oxide film on the surfaces. A light oxide scale on the 
outside and inside surfaces of U-bend shall be allowed for 
tubes which have been heat treated. 
10.2 Finished tubes shall be reasonably straight and have 
smooth ends free from burrs. Tubes shall have a workmanlike 
finish and shall be free of surface imperfections that cannot be 
removed within the allowable wall tolerances. Removal of 
smface imperfections such as handling marks, straightening 
marks, light mandrel and die marks, shallow pits, and scale 
pattern will not be required provided they are within the 
allowable wall tolerances. 
10.3 Finished tubes shall be coated both on the outside and 
the inside diameter to prevent corrosion in transit. The type of 
coating applied should be mutually agreed upon and specified 
in the order.

NOTE 2 (page 1014)
NOTE 2-The minimum average of 3 specimens shall not be less than 30 ft-lbf [41 J]. One specimen from a set of 3 may be less than 30 ft-lbf [41 
J] but not less than 25 ft-lbf [34 J]. 
Norn 3-The minimum average of 3 specimens shall not be less than 25 ft-lbf [34 J]. One specimen from a set of 3 may be less than 25 ft-lbf [34 
J] but not less than 20 ft-lbf [27 J]. 
Norn 4-No minimum values established. Tests shall be run for information only.
