SPECIFICATION FOR AGE-HARDENING STAINLESS 
STEEL FORGINGS 
SA-705/SA-705M 
<O 
INTERNATIONAL 
standards Worldwide 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 705/A 705M-95(2009).] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers age-hardening stainless 
steel forgings for general use. 
1.2 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
(metric) units are to be regarded separately as standards; 
within the text and tables, the SI units are shown in [brack­
ets]. The values stated in each system are not exact equiva­
lents; therefore, each system must be used independent of 
the other. Combining values from the two systems may 
result in nonconformance with the specification. 
1.3 Unless the order specifies an "M" designation, the 
material shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
NOTE 1 -Bar products are covered by Specification A 564/ A 564M. 
2. Referenced Documents 
2.1 ASTM Standards: 
A 370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Test­
ing of Steel Products 
A 484/ A 484M Specification for General Requirements 
for Stainless Steel Bars, Billets, and Forgings 
A 564/A 564M Specification for Hot-Rolled and Cold­
Finished Age-Hardening Stainless Steel Bars and Shapes 
A 751 Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology for 
Chemical Analysis of Steel Products

and Alloys (UNS) 
3. Ordering Information 
3.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify 
all requirements that are necessary for material ordered 
under this specification. Such requirements may include 
but are not limited to the following: 
3.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), 
3.1.2 Name of material (age-hardening stainless steel 
forgings), 
3.1.3 Dimensions, including prints or sketches, 
3.1.4 Type or UNS designation (Table 1), 
3.1.5 Heat treated condition (Section 5), 
3.1.6 Transverse properties when required (7.4), 
3.1.7 ASTM designation and date of issue, and 
3.1.8 Special requirements (5.3, 5.4). 
3.2 If possible the intended end use of the item should 
be given on the purchase order, especially when the item 
is ordered for a specific end use or uses. 
NOTE 2 - A typical ordering description is as follows: 5 age-hardening 
stainless steel forgings, Type 630, solution-annealed, ASTM Specification 
A 705 dated _ . End use: pump blocks for oil well equipment. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 In addition to the requirements of this specification, 
all requirements of the current edition of Specification 
A 484/A 484M shall apply. Failure to comply with the 
general requirements of Specification A 484 / A 484 M, con­
stitutes nonconformance with this specification. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Material for forgings shall consist of billets or bars, 
either forged, rolled or cast, or a section cut from an ingot. 
The cuts shall be made to the required length by a suitable 
process. This material may be specified to Specification 
A 564/ A 564M. 
5.2 The material shall be forged by hammering, press­
ing, rolling, extruding, or upsetting to produce a wrought 
structure throughout and shall be brought as nearly as 
possible to the finished shape and size by hot working.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-705/SA-70SM 
5.3 When specified on the order, sample forging may be 
sectioned and etched to show flow lines and the condition in 
regard to internal imperfections. When so specified, the 
question of acceptable and unacceptable metal flow shall 
be subject to agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser prior to order entry. 
5.4 When specified on the order, the manufacturer shall 
submit for approval of the purchaser a sketch showing the 
shape of the rough forging before machining, or before 
heat treating for mechanical properties. 
5.5 The grain size shall be as fine as practicable and 
precautions shall be taken to minimize grain growth. 
5.6 Material of types other than XM-9 shall be fur­
nished in the solution-annealed condition, or in the equal­
ized and over-tempered condition, as noted in Table 2 
unless otherwise specified by the purchaser. ' 
5.6.1 Types 630, XM-16, and XM-25 may be fur­
nished in the solution-annealed or age-hardened condition. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical composition 
limits specified in Table 1. 
6.2 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with 
Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A 751. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7 .1 The material, as represented by mechanical test 
specimens, shall conform to the mechanical property 
requirements specified in Table 2 and shall be capable of 
developing the properties in Table 3 when heat treated as 
specified in Table 3. 
7 .2 The yield strength shall be determined by the offset 
method as described in the current edition of Test Methods 
and Definitions A 370. The limiting permanent offset shall 
be 0.2% of the gage length of the specimen. 
7.3 The impact strength shall be determined at 70 to 
80°F [20 to 25°C], by Charpy V-notch specimen Type A 
as described in Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
7 .4 Material tensile tested and, when specified, impact 
tested in the transverse direction (perpendicular to the forg­
ing flow lines) and meeting the requirements shown in 
Table 3 need not be tested in the longitudinal direction. 
7.5 Samples cut from forging shall conform to the 
mechanical properties of Table 3 when heat treated as 
specified in Table 2 and Table 3 and tested in accordance 
with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
8. Prolongations for Tests 
8.1 Subject to Section 7, the forgings shall be produced 
with prolongations for testing, unless otherwise. specified. 
The producer may elect to submit an extra forging to repre­
sent each test lot instead of prolongations, or the test speci­
mens can be taken from the forgings themselves. 
9. Number of Tests 
9.1 For all classes of forgings weighing from 5000 to 
7000 lb [2300 to 3200 kg] each, at least one tension test 
shall be made from each forging. 
9.2 For all classes of forgings weighing more than 7000 
lb [3200 kg] each, one tension test shall be made from 
each end of each forging. In the case of ring forgings, the 
tension test specimen shall be removed from each of two 
locations on the periphery, approximately 180° apart, or 
insofar as practicable, from opposite ends of the forging. 
9.3 For forgings weighing less than 5000 lb [2300 
kg] each, one tension test shall be made from each size 
classification for each heat . in each heat treating charge. 
Where continuous heat treating furnaces are used, tests 
shall be made on 10% of the forgings of each size classifi­
cation from each heat subjected to the same heat treatment 
practice.

SA-723/SA-723M ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Alloy Steel Forgings for High-Strength Pressure Component 
Application 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers requirements for high­
strength quenched and tempered alloy steel forgings for pres­
sure vessels, isostatic presses, shock tubes, and similar com­
ponents. 
1.2 These materials are not intended for welded construc­
tion. 
1.3 Three grades of nickel-chromium-molybdenum steels 
and six classes of increasing tensile strength are included. The 
strength class, section size, and configuration of the forging 
will largely dictate the applicable type(s) of steel. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
(metric) units are to be regarded separately as the standard. 
Within the text and tables, the SI units are shown in brackets. 
The values stated in each system are not exact equivalents; 
therefore, each system must be used independently of the other. 
Combining values from the two systems may result in noncon­
formance with the specification. 
1.5 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch­
pound units. 
2. Referenced Documents 
2.1 ASTM Standards: 
A275/A275M Practice for Magnetic Particle Examination of 
Steel Forgings 
A370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Testing 
of Steel Products 
A388/A388M Practice for Ultrasonic Examination of Steel 
Forgings 
A 788/ A 788M Specification for Steel Forgings, General Re­
quirements 
2.2 Other Standards: 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code 
3. Ordering Information and General Requirements 
3.1 In addition to the ordering information required by 
Specification A788/A788M, the purchaser shall include with 
the inquiry and order a detailed drawing, sketch, or written 
description of the forging and the method of selecting test 
location (see 6.2). When appropriate, the areas of significant 
loading in the forging shall be designated. The purchaser may 
also include appropriate supplementary requirements from 
Specification A 788/ A 788M as well as from this specification. 
3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out­
lines additional ordering information, manufacturing 
requirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, 
marking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi­
tional supplementary requirements. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A 788/ A 788M, the 
requirements of this specification shall prevail. 
3.4 When forgings are required to be in compliance with 
Division 3 of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
Supplementary Requirement S6 should be specified. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Melting Practice-The steel melting procedures of 
Specification A 788/ A 788M shall apply except that the open­
hearth process shall not be used, and that the steel shall be 
vacuum degassed prior to or during the pouring of the ingot, in 
order to remove objectionable gases, particularly hydrogen. 
4.1.1 Use of secondary remelting or refining operations may 
be considered for particularly demanding applications. 
4.2 Discard-Sufficient discard shall be taken from each 
ingot to secure freedom from piping and excessive segregation. 
1176

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-723/SA-723M 
4.3 Heat Treatment: 
4.3.1 Forgings shall be rough-machined prior to final heat 
treatment if it is necessary to reduce the mass to ensure full 
hardening or to meet the requirements of 6.2. The risk of 
cracking during heat treatment with high-hardenability steels 
of the type covered by this specification should be borne in 
mind when deciding on the degree of surface preparation 
before heat treatment. 
4.3.2 Heat Treatment for Mechanical Properties-Heat 
treatment shall consist of normalizing (which may be part of 
the preliminary treatment), reaustenitization, liquid quenching, 
and tempering. The forgings shall be quenched in a suitable 
liquid medium by spraying or immersion. Quenching shall be 
followed by tempering at a minimum temperature of 1000°F 
[540°C]. The minimum time at tempering temperature shall be 
½ h/in. [½ h/25 mm] of maximum section thickness, unless 
otherwise agreed between supplier and purchaser. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam­
pling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall 
comply with Table 1. 
5.1.1 Temper Embrittlement Control-The purchaser's at­
tention is drawn to Supplementary Requirement S24 in Speci­
fication A788/A788M for application of the J Factor which 
may be of assistance in the control of temper embrittlement in 
forgings produced to Specification A 723/ A 723M. 
5.2 Product Analysis-The manufacturer shall use the prod­
uct analysis provision of Specification A788/A788M to obtain 
a product analysis from a forging representing each heat or 
multiple heat. The purchaser may also make this determination 
in accordance with Specification A788/A788M. 
6. Mechanical Properties 
6.1 General Requirements-The forging shall conform to 
the requirements of Table 2 and Table 3. The largest obtainable 
tension test specimen as specified in Test Methods and Defi­
nitions A370 (that is, standard round 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] 
diameter specimen) shall be used. Charpy V-notch Type A 
impact specimens, as shown in Test Methods and Definitions 
A370, shall be used. 
6.2 Sampling-The mid-point of the gage length of tension 
test specimens and the area under the notch of impact speci­
mens shall be located in accordance with one of the following 
methods as specified by the purchaser, or suggested by the 
Carbon, max

supplier and approved by the purchaser. Wherever practical, all 
testing shall be from integral prolongations of the forging. 
6.2.1 Method I-This method shall always be used when 
the maximum quenched thickness does not exceed 4 in. [100 
mm]. Datum points of the specimens, as described in 6.2, shall 
be located in the forging or test forging (6.2.4) at mid-thickness 
and at least 1/3 T (Tis the maximum heat-treated thickness) 
from the quenched end surface or nearest adjacent surfaces. 
6.2.2 Method 2-t by 2t, where t is the distance from the 
area of significant loading (3.1) to the nearest quenched 
surface. However, the datum points of the specimens as 
described in 6.2 shall not be nearer to one quenched surface 
than¾ in. [20 mm] and to the second quenched surface than 1 
½ in. [40 mm]. When this method of testing is employed, 
forgings are usually manufactured in accordance with a 
purchaser-approved drawing showing prequenched dimensions 
and the location of mechanical test specimens. It is commonly 
used for disk-type forgings such as tube sheets and covers. 
6.2.3 Method 3-For maximum quenched thicknesses in 
excess of 4 in. [100 mm] as heat treated. Where this method of 
testing is employed, the datum points of the test specimen, as 
described in 6.2, shall be removed ¼ T from the nearest 
quenched surface and 2 /2 T from the quenched end surface or 
nearest adjacent surface. 
6.2.4 Method 4-Test specimens shall be taken from a 
representative separate test forging made from the same heat of 
steel, which shall receive substantially the same reduction and 
type of hot working, and have a cross section not less than the 
production forgings which it represents. It shall be heat treated 
in the same furnace charge and under the same conditions as 
the production forgings. The test specimen shall be removed 
using the Method 3 procedure. 
6.3 Thermal Buffers: 
6.3.1 Thermal buffer rings, at least Thy Tin cross section or 
sections of such a ring at least 3 Tin length, shall be welded to 
the test end(s) of a forging prior to heat treatment for 
mechanical properties. The buffer material may be any weld­
able carbon or low-alloy steel and shall be joined to the forging 
with a partial penetration-type weld which completely seals the 
buffered surface. The test coupons shall be removed from the 
forging in the region buffered by the ring or ring segments. If 
the latter are used, the test coupons shall be removed from the 
forging in the area under the center ½ of the buffer ring 
segment length. In either case, the test specimens shall be 
located at a minimum distance of ½ in. [13 mm] from the 
buffered surface of the forging and at least ¼ T from a 
quenched surface of the forging. Buffered weld areas must be 
at least 1 in. [25 mm] from any finished machining surface of 
the complete forging. 
6.3.2 Bearing in mind the characteristics of the base mate­
rials included in this specification, precautions should be taken, 
such as the use of pre- and post-weld heating and austenitic 
weld metal, to minimize the occurrence of crack-like defects. 
6.3.3 Approval of the purchaser should be obtained for the 
use of this method. 
6.4 Samples shall be removed from the forgings after 
quenching and tempering.

6.6.1 For forgings weighing 1000 lb [455 kg] or less, as heat 
treated but not exceeding 80 in. [2030 mm] in length, exclud­
ing test material, one tension test and one set of impact tests 
(three specimens) shall be taken to represent each heat in each 
heat-treatment charge. This testing shall be repeated at the 
opposite end of the same test forging, if the heat-treated length 
excluding test material exceeds 80 in. [2030 mm]. When heat 
treatment is performed in continuous-type furnaces with suit­
able temperature control and equipped with recording pyrom­
eters so that complete heat-treatment records are available, a 
heat-treatment charge shall be considered as any continuous 
run not exceeding 8 h in duration. 
6.6.2 Forgings weighing over 1000 lb [455 kg] but not over 
5000 lb [2270 kg] as heat treated and not over 80 in. [2030 
mm] in length excluding test material, one tension test and one 
set of three impact tests shall be removed from each forging. 
When the length of the forging exceeds 80 in. [2030 mm] this 
testing shall be repeated at the opposite end of the forging. 
6.6.3 Forgings exceeding 5000 lb [2270 kg] and not over 80 
in. [2030 mm] in length, excluding test material, shall have one 
tension test and one set of three impact tests removed from 
each of two locations, 180° apart. For forgings with lengths 
exceeding 80 in. [2030 mm] this testing shall be repeated at the 
opposite end of the forging. Supplementary Requirement S6 is 
applicable for forgings intended for use under the rules of 
Section VIII, Division 3 of the ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code. 
7. Nondestructive Examination Requirements

(b) In addition to the reportable conditions of Practice 
A388/A388M, indications exceeding the resultant back­
reflection shall be recorded. 
(c) A forging shall be unacceptable when one or more 
reflections are present producing indications accompanied by a 
complete loss of back-reflection, not attributable to nor asso­
ciated with the geometric configuration. For this purpose, a

subject to rejection. 
(c) The report of the ultrasonic test shall be in compliance 
with Practice A388/A388M. 
(d) Additional nondestructive examination or trepanning 
may be employed to resolve questions of interpretation of 
ultrasonic indications. The manufacturer shall accept respon­
sibility for injurious defects that will not be removed in final 
machining. 
7 .2 Magnetic Particle Examination: 
7 .2.1 Each forging shall be examined by magnetic particle 
methods described in Practice A275/A275M. Acceptance and 
rejection standards shall be as follows: Only indications with 
major dimensions greater than ½6 in. [1.6 mm] shall be 
considered relevant. The following relevant indications are 
unacceptable:

purchaser in the inquiry or order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be agreed upon 
by the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
Sl. Charpy V-Notch Impact Transition Curve 
S 1.1 Sufficient impact tests shall be made from the forging 
test material to establish a temperature-absorbed energy curve. 
The test temperature range shall be wide enough to establish 
the upper and lower shelf foot-pound-force energies, with 
sufficient testing at intermediate temperatures to permit plot­
ting a reasonably smooth curve. 
S 1.2 Instead of plotting an impact transition curve, impact

S6; 1 Forgings exeeding 5000 lb [2270kg] at the time of heat 
treatment, and not over 80 in. [2030 mm] in length, excluding 
test material, require one set of test specimens to be taken from 
each end of the forging. Each test specimen set shall consist of 
one tension test and three Charpy V-notch specimens. The test 
specimen set locations shall be spaced 180° apart, end to end. 
When the forging length exceeds 80 in. [2030 mm] excluding 
test material two sets of mechanical test specimens shall be 
removed from each end of the forging, and spaced 180° apart 
at the same end, and rotated 90° end to end.

Specification for 
Carbon Steel Forgings for Piping Components with Inherent 
Notch Toughness 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers forged carbon steel piping 
components intended primarily for service in pressure piping 
systems from -20 to +650 °F [-30 to +345 °C] where inherent 
notch toughness is desired, but where notch toughness testing 
is not required. Included are forged or ring-rolled flanges, 
forged fittings, and valves made to specified dimensions, or to 
dimensional standards such as the ASME and API specifica­
tions referenced in Section 2. 
1.2 This specification is limited to forgings with maximum 
finished section thicknesses no larger than 2 in. [51 mm]. 
1.3 It shall be the responsibility of the purchaser to deter­
mine whether material meeting the requirements of this speci­
fication is satisfactory for the service application. 
1.4 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when 
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply 
only when specified by the purchaser in the order. 
NOTE 1-There are no provisions for impact testing in this specifica­
tion. When impact testing is required, refer to Specification A350/A350M. 
1.5 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the

consist of uniformly heating the forgings to a temperature 
between 1550 and 1700 °F [845 and 925 °C], holding a 
sufficient time to attain uniform temperature throughout, and 
cooling in still air. The forging shall be at a temperature below 
1000 °F [540 °C] before heating for normalizing. 
5.1.2 Quenching-The procedure for quenching shall con­
sist of uniformly heating the forging to a temperature between 
1550 and 1700 °F [845 and 925 °C], holding a sufficient time 
to attain uniform temperature throughout, and quenching into a 
suitable liquid medium. The forging shall be at a temperature 
below 1000 °F [540 °C] before heating for quenching. 
5 .1.3 Tempering-The procedure for tempering shall consist 
of reheating the forging subsequent to normalizing or quench­
ing to a temperature of at least 1100 °F [595 °C], but not above 
the lower transformation temperature, for 30 min/in. [30 
min/25 mm] of maximum section thickness, with minimum 
holding time at tempering temperature not less than 30 min. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
6.2 Steels to which lead has been added shall not be used.

ments for tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. 
7 .1.1.1 The test specimen shall be obtained from a rough or 
finished production forging, or prolongation thereof, or it may 
be obtained from separately forged test blanks from the same 
heat of steel as the production forging. The test blank shall be 
reduced by forging in a manner similar to that for the products 
represented, shall receive approximately the same hot working 
and reduction, be of the same nominal thickness, and receive 
the same heat treatment as the finished products represented. 
The test material shall be treated in the same furnace at the 
same time as the forging it represents, subject to the require­
ments of 7 .1.2.1.
