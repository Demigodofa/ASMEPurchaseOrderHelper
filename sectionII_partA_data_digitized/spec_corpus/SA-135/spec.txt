SA-135/SA-135M (ASTM A135/A135M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
a Designation: A135/A135M -21 
~ull 
INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Steel Pipe 1 
This standard is issued uuder the fixed designation A135/A135M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers two grades of electric­
resistance-welded steel pipe in NPS 2 to NPS 30 [DN 50 to DN 
750] inclusive, with nominal (average) wall thickness up to 
0.500 in. [12.70 mm], inclusive, and in nominal sizes NPS 
¾ to NPS 5 [DN 20 to DN 125] inclusive with nominal 
(average) wall thickness 0.083 in. [2.11 mm] to 0.134 in. [3.40 
mm], depending on size. Pipe having other dimensions (Note 
1) may be furnished provided such pipe complies with all other 
requirements of this specification. The pipe is intended for 
conveying gas, vapor, water or other liquid; only Grade A is 
adapted for flanging and bending (Note 2). The suitability of 
pipe for various purposes is somewhat dependent upon its 
dimensions, properties, and conditions of service, so that the 
purpose for which the pipe is intended should be stated in the 
order. The pipe may be furnished either nonexpanded or cold 
expanded at the option of the manufacturer. When pipe is cold 
expanded, the amount of expansion shall not exceed 1.5 % of 
the outside diameter pipe size. 
NOTE 1-A comprehensive listing of standardized pipe dimensions is 
contained in ASME B36.lOM. 
NOTE 2-This provision is not intended to prohibit the cold bending of 
Grade B pipe. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.3 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

order, the heat analyses shall be reported to the purchaser or a 
representative of the purchaser. 
7. Product Analysis 
7 .1 An analysis may be made by the purchaser on samples 
of pipe selected at random and shall conform to the require­
ments specified in Table 2. Methods and practices relating to 
chemical analysis shall be in accordance with Test Method, 
Practices, and Terminology A751. 
8. Mechanical Properties Requirements 
8.1 Tensile Properties: 
8.1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in Table 1. 
8.1.2 The yield strength shall be determined by the offset 
method utilizing 0.2 % of the gauge length or by the total 
extension under load method using 0.5 % of the gauge length. 
8.1.3 Longitudinal test specimens shall be full-size longitu­
dinal test specimens (see Figure A2.1 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370) or longitudinal strip test specimens (see 
Specimen No. 4 in Fig. A2.3 of Test Methods and Definitions 
A370). 
8.2 The test specimen taken across the weld shall show a 
tensile strength not less than the minimum tensile strength 
specified for the grade of pipe ordered. This test will not be 
required for pipe under NPS 8 [DN 200]. 
9. Flattening Test 
9.1 A specimen at least 4 in. [100 mm] in length shall be 
flattened cold between parallel plates in three steps with the 
weld located either 0° or 90° from the line of direction of force 
as required in 9.2. During the first step, which is a test for 
ductility of the weld, no cracks or breaks on the inside or 
outside surfaces shall occur before the distance between the 
plates is less than two thirds of the original outside diameter of 
the pipe. As a second step, the flattening shall be continued. 
During the second step, which is a test for ductility exclusive 
of the weld, no cracks or breaks on the inside or outside 
surfaces shall occur before the distance between the plates is 
less than one third of the original outside diameter of the pipe 
but is not less than five times the wall thickness of the pipe. 
During the third step, which is a test for soundness, the 
flattening shall be continued until the specimen breaks or the 
opposite walls of the pipe meet. Evidence of laminated or 
unsound material or of incomplete weld that is revealed during 
the entire flattening test shall be cause for rejection. 
9 .2 For pipe produced in single lengths, the flattening test 
specified in 9 .1 shall be made on both crop ends cut from each 
iength of pipe. The tests from each end shall be made 
alternately with the weld at 0° and at 90° from the line of 
direction of force. For pipe produced in multiple lengths, the 
flattening test shall be made on crop ends representing the front 
and back of each coil with the weld at 90° from the line of 
direction of force, and on two intermediate rings representing 
each coil with the weld 0° from the line of direction of force. 
188 
9 .3 Surface imperfections in the test specimen before 
flattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening 
test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements 
in Section 13. 
9 .4 Superficial cracks as a result of surface imperfections 
shall not be cause for rejection. 
10. Hydrostatic Test 
10.1 Except as provided for in 10.3, each length of pipe 
shall be hydrostatically tested at the mill, without leakage 
through the wall, to a pressure calculated from the following 
equation: 
P = 2St/D 
where: 
P = minimum hydrostatic test pressure, psi, [kPa]. The test 
pressure need not exceed 2500 psi [17 200 kPa], 
S = allowable fiber stress 18 000 psi [124 000 kPa] for 
Grade A and 21 000 psi [145 000 kPa] for Grade B. 
This does not prohibit testing at higher pressure at the 
manufacturer's option, 
t = specified wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
D = specified outside diameter, in. [mm]. 
Plain end pipe may be tested at the discretion of the 
manufacturer in single lengths or in multiple lengths. 
10.2 The hydrostatic pressure shall be maintained for not 
less than 5 s. 
10.3 When specified in the order, pipe may be furnished 
without hydrostatic testing, and each length so furnished shall 
include with the mandatory marking the letters "NH." 
Nam 3-This provision is not intended to apply to light wall (Schedule 
10) pipe listed in Table Xl.1. 
10.4 When certification is required by the purchaser and the 
hydrostatic test has been omitted, the certification shall clearly 
state "Not Hydrostatically Tested." The specification number 
and material grade, as shown on the certification, shall be 
followed by the letters "NH." 
11. Nondestructive Examination Reqnirements 
11.1 As an alternate to the hydrostatic test, and when 
accepted by the purchaser, each pipe shall be tested with a 
nondestructive electric test. Except for pipe produced on a 
hot-stretch reducing mill, the weld seam of each length of pipe 
shall be tested with a nondestructive test in accordance with 
Practices E213, E273, E309, or E570. Each length of pipe 
produced on a hot-stretch-reducing mill shall be tested with a 
nondestructive electric test that inspects the full volume of the 
pipe in accordance with Practices E213, E309, or E570. 
11.2 Recognized methods for meeting this test are electro­
magnetic (eddy current) or ultrasonic. 
11.3 The following information is for the benefit of the user 
of this specification: 
11.3.1 The ultrasonic examination referred to in this speci­
fication is intended to detect longitudinal imperfections having 
a reflective area similar to or larger than the reference notch.

=== Page 241 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-135/SA-135M (ASTM A135/A135M) 
The examination may not detect circumferentially oriented 
imperfections of short, deep imperfections. 
11.3.2 The eddy-current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
imperfections, especially of the short, abrupt type. 
11.3.3 The hydrostatic test referred to in Section 10 is a test 
method provided for in many product specifications. This test 
has the capability of finding imperfections of a size permitting 
the test fluid to leak through the tube wall and may be either 
visually seen or detected by a loss of pressure. This test may 
not detect very tight, through-the-wall imperfections or imper­
fections that extend an appreciable distance into the wall 
without complete penetration. 
11.3 .4 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of imperfections that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
11.4 In order to accommodate the various types of nonde­
structive electric testing equipment and techniques in use, the 
calibration pipe shall contain, at the option of the producer, any 
one or more of the following discontinuities to establish a 
minimum sensitivity level for rejection: 
11.4.1 Drilled Hole-A hole not larger than 0.031-in. [0.8-
mm] diameter shall be drilled radially and completely through 
pipe wall, preferably in the weld area, care being taken to avoid 
distortion of the pipe while drilling. 
11.4.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-A notch shall be filed 
or milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the 
longitudinal axis of the pipe preferably in the weld area. Said 
notch shall have a depth not exceeding 12.5 % of the nominal 
wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in., [0.10 mm], whichever 
is greater. 
11.4.3 Longituclinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
pipe axis on the outside surface of the pipe preferably in the 
weld area, to have a depth not exceeding 12.5 % of the nominal 
wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.10 mm], whichever is 
greater. 
11.5 Pipe producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
calibration imperfection shall be rejected. 
12. Dimensions, Weight (Mass), and Permissible 
Variations 
12.1 Weight (Mass)-The weight (mass) of any length of 
pipe other than Schedule 10 shall not vary more than 3.5 % 
under or 10 % over that specified, but the carload weight 
(mass) shall be not more than 1.75 % under the nominal weight 
(mass). The weight (mass) of pipe furnished to Schedule 10 
shall not vary more than ± 10 % from that calculated using the 
weight (mass) per unit length prescribed in Appendix Table 
Xl.1. The weight (mass) of the pipe shall be calculated from 
the relevant equation in ASME B36.10M. 
Note 4-A system of standard pipe sizes has been approved by the 
American National Standards Institute as American National Standard for 
Welded and Seamless Wrought Steel Pipe (ASME B36.lOM). 
12.2 Diameter-The outside diameter shall not vary more 
than ± 1 % from the nominal size specified. 
12.3 Minimum Wall Thickness-The minimum wall thick­
ness at any point shall be not more than 12.5 % under the 
specified wall thickness. 
Note 5-The minimum wall thickness on inspection is shown in Table 
Xl.2 of the Appendix. 
12.4 Lengths: 
12.4.1 Except as allowed in 12.4.2, pipe shall be furnished 
in lengths averaging 38 ft [11.6 m] or over, with a minimum 
length of 20 ft [6.1 m], but no more than 5 % may be under 32 
ft [9.8 m]. Jointers made by welding are permissible. When 
threaded pipe is ordered, jointers shall be made by threaded 
connections and shall not exceed 5 % of the order. 
12.4.2 Unless otherwise specified, Schedule 10 pipe shall be 
between 16 and 22 ft [4.9 and 6.7 m] for a minimum of 90 % 
of the footage furnished, with any balance being shorter 
lengths at least 8 ft [2.4 m] long. 
13. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
13.1 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight and free 
of defects. Surface imperfections in excess of 12.5 % of the 
nominal wall thickness shall be considered defects. 
13.2 End Finish: 
13.2.1 Schedule JO Pipe-Pipe furnished to Schedule 10 
shall be plain end only. All inside and outside cutting burrs 
shall be removed. This generally involves breaking the comers. 
13.2.2 Ends, Plain End Pipe-Unless otherwise specified, 
plain end pipe for use with the Dresser or Dayton type coupling 
shall be reamed both outside and inside sufficiently to remove 
all burrs. Plain end pipe for welding shall be beveled on the 
outside to an angle of 30° with a tolerance of+ 5° and - 0° and 
with a width of flat at the end of the pipe of 1/16 ± ½2 in. [1.6 
± 0.8 mm]. When material is ordered beveled to any other than 
a 30° angle, it should be understood that the angle is to be 
measured from a line drawn perpendicular to the axis of the 
pipe. This means that a greater amount of material is removed 
with a 60° angle than with a 30° angle. Pipe shall be 
sufficiently free from indentations, projections, or roll marks 
for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] from the end of the pipe to 
make a tight joint with the rubber gasket type of coupling. All 
plain end pipe intended for Dresser or Dayton type joints or for 
welding, sizes NPS 10 [DN 250] and smaller in outside 
diameter specified, shall be not more than 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] 
smaller than the outside diameter specified for a distance of 8 
in. [200 mm] from the ends of the pipe and shall permit the 
passing for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] of a ring gauge that has 
a bore 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] larger than the outside diameter 
specified of the pipe. Sizes larger than NPS 10 [DN 250] shall 
be not more than 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] smaller than the nominal 
outside diameter for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] from the end 
of the pipe and shall permit the passing for a distance of 8 in. 
[200 mm] of a ring gauge which has a bore 3/32 in. [2.4 mm] 
larger than the nominal outside diameter of the pipe. 
189 
13.2.3 Ends, Threaded Pipe-Each end of threaded pipe 
shall be reamed to remove all burrs. All threads shall be in 
accordance with the American National Standard Pipe Threads

=== Page 242 ===

SA-135/SA-135M (ASTM A135/A135M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
(Note 6) and cut so as to make a tight joint when the pipe is 
tested at the mill to the specified internal hydrostatic pressure. 
The variation from the standard, when tested with the standard 
working gauge, shall not exceed one and one-half turns either 
way. Pipe shall not be rounded by hammering in order to get a 
full thread. There shall be not more than two black threads for 
¾-in. [19.0-mm] taper among the perfect threads. Black 
threads should not be confused with imperfect threads, such as 
those torn, shaven, or broken. 
Nara 6-A complete description of the American National Standard 
Pipe Threads applicable to pipe, valves, and fittings is contained in ASME 
B1.20.1; also "Screw-Thread Standards for Federal Services, 1942," 
National Bureau of Standards Handbook H 28, January, 1942, the perti­
nent data in both sources being identical. 
13.3 Couplings-Each length of threaded pipe shall be 
provided with one coupling manufactured in accordance with 
Specification A865/ A865M except that the coupling may be 
wrought iron (Note 7). Threads shall be cut so as to make a 
tight joint. Taper-tapped couplings shall be furnished on all 
weights (masses) of threaded pipe NPS 2½ [DN 65] and larger. 
NoTE 7-For sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and smaller, it is commercial 
practice to furnish straight-tapped couplings for standard-weight (mass) 
(Schedule 40) pipe and taper-tapped couplings for extra-strong (Schedule 
80) and double-extra-strong pipe. If taper-tapped couplings are required 
for sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and smaller on standard weight (mass) (Schedule 
40) pipe, line pipe in accordance with Specification 5L of the American 
Petroleum Institute should be ordered, thread lengths to be in accordance 
with ASME B 1.20.1. Taper-tapped couplings for sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and 
smaller in standard weight (mass) may be used on mill-threaded standard 
weight (mass) type of the same size. 
13.4 Protective Coating: 
13.4.1 After the pipe has been subjected to the hydrostatic 
test, and if required by the purchaser, it shall be thoroughly 
cleaned of all dirt, oil, grease, loose scale, and rust; then dried, 
and given a protective coating of the kind and in the manner 
specified by the purchaser. Pipe furnished to Schedule 10 shall 
be normally shipped with a light coating of processing oil. If so 
specified, the pipe can be given a mill coating or a special 
coating. 
14. Weld Repair 
14.1 Welding Repair: 
14.2 Defects in the pipe wall, provided their depth does not 
exceed one third the specified wall thickness, shall be repaired 
by electric welding. Defects in the welds such as sweats or 
leaks, unless otherwise specified, shall be repaired or the piece 
rejected at the option of the manufacturer. Repairs of this 
nature shall be made by completely removing the defect, 
cleaning the cavity, and then electric welding. 
14.3 All repaired pipe shall be retested hydrostatically in 
accordance with Section 10. 
15. Sampling 
15.1 Chemical Analysis: 
15.1.1 Samples for chemical analysis shall be taken in 
accordance with Test Method, Practices, and Terminology 
A751. The number of samples shall be determined as follows: 
NPS 
Under 6 [DN 150] 
6 [DN 150] to 20 [DN 
500], incl 
Over 20 [DN 500] to 
30 [DN 750], incl 
15.2 Tension Test: 
Numbers of Samples Selected 
2 from each lot of 400 pipes or fraction 
thereof 
2 from each lot of 200 pipes or fraction 
thereof 
2 from each lot of 100 pipes or fraction 
thereof 
15.2.1 One longitudinal tension test shall be made on one 
length (Note 8) from each lot of 400 lengths or fraction thereof 
of each size under NPS 8 [DN 200] and one transverse body 
and one transverse weld tension test on one length from each 
lot of 200 lengths or fraction thereof of each size NPS 8 to NPS 
20 [DN 200 to DN 500] and on one length from each lot of 100 
lengths or fraction thereof of each size over NPS 20 to NPS 30 
[DN 500 to DN 750]. When taken from the skelp, the number 
of tests shall be determined in the same manner as when taken 
from the finished pipe. 
NoTE 8-Length is defined as the length as ordered, except that in the 
case of orders for cut lengths shorter than double random, which is defined 
as the length as rolled, prior to cutting to the required short lengths. 
15.3 Flattening Test: 
15 .3 .1 When pipe is produced in single length, the flattening 
test specified in 9.1 shall be made on both crop ends cut from 
each length of pipe. When pipe is produced in multiple lengths, 
flattening tests are required on the crop ends from the front and 
back ends of each coil and on two intermediate rings repre­
senting each coil. 
15.4 Hydrostatic Test: 
15.4.1 Each length of pipe shall be subjected to the hydro­
static test specified in Section 10. 
16. Test, Retest, and Resampling 
16.1 Chemical Analysis: 
190 
16.1.1 If the results of the analysis of either length of pipe 
does not conform to the requirements specified in Section 7, 
analyses of two additional lengths from the same lot shall be 
made, each of which shall conform to the requirements 
specified. 
16.2 Tension Test: 
16.2.1 The test specimens and the tests required by this 
specification shall conform to those described in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370, except that all specimens shall be tested 
at room temperature. 
16.2.2 The longitudinal tension test specimen shall be taken 
from the end of the pipe, or by agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser may be taken from the skelp, 
at a point approximately 90° from the weld, and shall not be 
flattened between gauge marks. The sides of each specimen 
shall be parallel between gauge marks. At the manufacturer 
option, the tension test may be made on full section of pipe. 
16.2.3 Transverse weld test specimens shall be taken with 
the weld at the center of the specimen. Transverse body test 
specimens shall be taken opposite to the weld. All transverse 
test specimens shall be approximately 1 ½ in. [38 mm] wide in 
the gauge length and shall represent the full wall thickness of 
the pipe from which the specimen was cut.

16.2.4 ff any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws not associated with the quality of the steel or the 
welding, it may be discarded and another specimen substituted. 
16.2.5 If the results of the tension tests of any lot do not 
conform to the requirements specified in 9.1, retests of two 
additional lengths from the same lot shall be made, each of 
which shall conform to the requirements specified. 
16.2.6 If the percentage of elongation of any tension test 
specimen is less than that specified in 8.1, and any part of the 
fracture is more than ¾-in. [19.0-mm] from the center of the 
gauge length as indicated by scribe scratches marked on the 
specimen before testing, the specimen may be discarded and 
another substituted. 
16.3 Flattening Test: 
16.3.1 Specimens for flattening tests shall be smooth at the 
ends and free from burrs. 
16.3.2 If any section of the pipe fails to comply with the 
requirements of 9.1, for pipe produced in single lengths, other 
sections may be cut from the same end of the same length until 
satisfactory tests are obtained, except that the finished pipe 
shall not be shorter than 80 % of its length after the initial 
cropping; otherwise, the length shall be rejected. For pipe 
produced in multiple lengths, retests may be cut from each end 
of each individual length in the multiple; such tests shall be 
made with the weld alternately 0° and 90° from the line of 
direction of force. 
16.4 All specimens shall be tested at room temperature. 
17. Inspection 
17 .1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
free entry, at all times while work on the contract of the 
purchaser is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's 
works that concern the manufacture of the material ordered. 
The manufacturer shall afford the inspector, without charge, all 
reasonable facilities to satisfy him that the material is being 
furnished in accordance with this specification. All tests 
( except check analysis) and inspection shall be made at the 
place of manufacture prior to shipment, unless otherwise 
specified, and shall be so conducted as not to interfere 
unnecessarily with the manufacturer's operation. 
18. Rejection 
18.1 Each length of pipe received from the manufacturer 
may be inspected by the purchaser and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of this specification based on the inspection and 
test method as outlined in the specification, the length may be 
rejected and the manufacturer shall be notified. Disposition of 
rejected pipe shall be a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
18.2 Pipe found in fabrication or in installation to be 
unsuitable for the intended use, under the scope and require­
ments of this specification, may be set aside and the manufac­
turer notified. Such pipe shall be subject to mutual investiga­
tion as to the nature and severity of the deficiency and the 
forming or installation, or both, conditions involved. Disposi­
tion shall be a matter for agreement. 
19. Certificate of Compliance 
19.1 When specified in the purchase order, the producer or 
supplier shall furnish to the purchaser a certificate of compli­
ance stating that the pipe has been manufactured, sampled, 
tested and inspected in accordance with this specification 
(including the year of issue) and has been found to meet the 
requirements. 
20. Identification of Material 
20.1 Each length of pipe shall be legibly marked with 
appropriate symbols by stenciling, stamping, or rolling to show 
the manufacturer's name, the size, the specification 
designation, the grade, and the hydrostatic test pressure when 
tested, or the letters "NH" when not tested. 
20.2 In addition to the requirements in 20.1, bar coding is 
acceptable as a supplemental identification method. The pur­
chaser may specify in the order a specific bar coding system to 
be used. 
21. Packaging, Marking, and Loading for Shipment 
21.1 When specified on the purchase order, packaging, 
marking, and loading for shipment shall be in accordance with 
Guide A700. 
21.2 The applicable levels shall be as specified in the 
contract. Marking for shipment of such material shall be in 
accordance with Fed. Std. No. 123 for civil agencies and 
MIL-STD-129 if continuous marking is required for military 
agencies.

INTIIRNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Carbon Steel and Carbon­
Manganese Steel Boiler and Superheater Tubes 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation Al 78/ Al 78M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
electric-resistance-welded tubes made of carbon steel and 
carbon-manganese steel intended for use as boiler tubes, boiler 
flues, superheater flues, and safe ends. 
1.2 This specification covers Grades A, C, and D with 
differing chemical requirements (Section 6 and Table 1), 
differing tensile requirements (Section 9 and Table 2), and 
differing crush and mechanical testing requirements (Sections 
10 and 11). 
NOTE I-Grades C and D tubes are not suitable for safe-ending for 
forge welding. 
1.3 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are ½ to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside 
diameter and 0.035 to 0.360 in. [0.9 to 9.1 mm], inclusive, in 
minimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may 
be furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.4 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.Q15 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.5 Optional supplementary requirements are provided and 
when desired, shall be so stated in the order. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order.

any element other than those listed in Table 1 is not permitted. 
7. Product Analysis 
7.1 When requested on the purchase order, a product analy­
sis shall be made by the manufacturer or supplier from one tube 
per 100 pieces for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm] and one tube per 
250 pieces for sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under; or when tubes 
are identified by heat, one tube per heat shall be analyzed. The 
chemical composition thus determined shall conform to the 
requirements specified. 
7 .2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be 
made. Both retests, for the elements in question, shall meet the 
requirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot (Note 2) shall be rejected or, at the 
option of the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or tube 
may be individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat-
rolled stock or tubes which do not meet the requirements of the 
specifications shall be rejected. 
NOTE 2-A lot consists of 250 tubes for sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under 
and of 100 tubes for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm], prior to cutting to length. 
8. General Requirements 
8.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A450/A450M unless otherwise provided herein. 
9. Tensile Requirements 
9.1 Grade C and D tubes shall conform to the requirements 
as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. 
Nom 3-Explanatory Note-For purposes of design the following 
tensile properties may be assumed for Grade A tubes: 
Tensile strength, min, ksi [MPa] 47 [325] 
Yield Strength, min, ksl [MPa] 26 [180] 
Elongation In 2 in. or 50 mm, min, % 35 
9.2 Table 3 gives the computed minimum elongation values 
for each 1/32-in. [0.8 mm] decrease in wall thickness. Where the 
wall thickness lies between two values shown above, the 
minimum elongation value shall be determined by the follow­
ing equation: 
E = 48t+ 15.00[E = l.87t+ 15.00] 
where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm,%, and, 
= actual thickness of specimen, in. [mm]. 
10. Crush Test 
10.1 When required by the purchaser, crushing tests shall be 
made on sections of tube 2½ in. [63 mm] in length which shall 
stand crushing longitudinally without cracking, splitting, or 
opening at the weld, as follows: 
Wall Thickness of 
Tubes, In. [mm] 
Height of Crushed Section, in. [mm] 
Grade A Tubes Grade C and D Tubes 
0.135 [3.43] and under % [19] or until outside Crush tests not required 
folds are in contact 
Over 0.135 [3.43] 1 ¼ [32] 
10.2 For tubing less than 1 in. [25.4 mm] in outside 
diameter, the length of the specimen shall be 2½ times the 
outside diameter of the tube. Slight surface checks shall not be 
cause for rejection.

and Condenser Tubes 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
seamless cold-drawn low-carbon steel tubes for tubular heat 
exchangers, condensers, and similar heat transfer apparatus. 
1.2 This specification covers tubes 1/s to 3 in. [3.2 to 76.2 
mm], inclusive, in outside diameter. 
NoTE I-Tubing smaller in outside diameter and having a thinner wall 
than indicated in this specification is available. Mechanical property 
requirements do not apply to tubing smaller than Vs in. [3.2 mm] in outside 
diameter or with a wall thickness under 0.015 in. [0.4 mm]. 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
