(Identical with ASTM Specification A 522/ A 522M-07.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers 8 and 9% nickel-alloy 
steel forged or rolled flanges, fittings, valves, and parts 
intended for use in welded pressure vessels for low-temper­
ature service. The specification is applicable to forgings 
with maximum section thickness of 3 in. [75 mm] in the 
double normalized and tempered condition and 5 in. 
[125 mm] in the quenched and tempered condition. Forg­
ings under this specification are intended for service at 
operating temperatures not lower than -320°F [-196°C] 
for Type I or -275°F [-170°C] for Type II or higher than 
250°F [121 °C]. 
1.2 Material under this specification is available in two 
types having different chemical compositions as follows: 
Type

1.3 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound 
units and SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the 
material shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification.

temperature of 1475 ± 25°F [800 ± 15°C]; hold at this 
temperature for a minimum time of 1 h/in. [2.5 min/mm] 
of thickness but in no case less than 30 min; quench by 
immersion in circulating water. Reheat until the forging 
attains a uniform temperature within the range from 1050 
to l 125°F [565 to 605°C]; hold at this temperature for a 
minimum time of 1 h/in. [2.5 min/mm] of thickness but 
minimum rate of 300°F [165°C]/h to a temperature not 
exceeding 600°F [3 l 5°C]. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Tension Test - Forgings to Types 1 and 2 shall 
conform to the tensile requirements of Table 2. 
7 .2 Impact Test - The Charpy impact test requirements 
in Table 3 shall be met unless Supplementary Requirement

shall be free of injurious defects. 
9. Number of Tests and Retests 
9.1 At least one tension test and one set of Charpy 
V-notch impact tests shall be made from each heat in each 
heat-treatment charge. 
9.2 If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform 
to the specified requirements, the manufacturer may retreat 
the forgings, but not more than three additional times. 
Retreatment involves re-austenitizing the forgings. Retests 
shall be made in accordance with this section.

6.2 When stress relieving is to be performed after fabri­
cation, the recommended stress-relieving treatment is as 
follows: gradually and uniformly heat the steel to a temper­
ature between 1025 and 1085°F [550 and 585°C]; hold for 
a minimum of 2 h for thicknesses up to I in. [25 mm].

10. Test Specimens 
10.1 The test specimens shall be located at any point 
midway between the center and surface of solid forgings, 
and at any point mid-thickness of the heaviest section of 
hollow or bored forgings. For solid forgings where test 
metal is provided on the periphery, test specimens shall 
be taken at mid-thickness of the test prolongation. 
10.2 Tests shall be oriented so that the longitudinal 
axis of the specimen is parallel to the major direction of 
grain flow.

purchaser shall specify stress relieving of the test pieces 
prior to machining of the test specimens. Stress relieving 
shall be carried out as prescribed in 6.2.

11. Method of Impact Testing 
11.1 The impact test shall be made in accordance with 
the simple beam, Charpy type of test described in the latest 
issue of Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
11.2 Precaution shall be taken so that when broken, 
the test specimens shall be within ± 3°F [l.7°C] of the 
specified test temperature. 
12. Inspection 
12.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall 
have free entry, at all times while work on the contract 
of the purchaser is being performed, to all parts of the 
manufacturer's works that concern the manufacture of the 
material ordered. The manufacturer shall afford the inspec­
tor all reasonable facilities to satisfy the inspector that 
the material is being furnished in accordance with this 
specification. All tests (except product analysis) and 
inspection shall be made at the place of manufacture prior 
to shipment, unless otherwise specified, and shall be con­
ducted so as not to interfere unnecessarily with the opera­
tion of the works. 
12.2 The manufacturer shall report to the purchaser or 
the purchaser's representative the heat treatments applied 
to the material and to the test blocks and the results of the 
chemical analysis and mechanical tests made in accordance 
with this specification and the heat number or his heat 
identification. 
13. Rejection 
13.1 Unless otherwise specified, any rejection based 
on tests made in accordance with Section 5 and 7 shall be 
including the impact test temperature, and test coupon 
stress relief details if applicable, 
14.1.4 Results of any additional or supplementary 
requirements specified by the purchaser, and 
14.1.5 The year date and revision letter, if any, of 
the specification. Note, this information is not required to 
be marked on the forgings. 
15. Product Marking 
15.1 Each forging shall be legibly stamped by the man­
ufacturer with the heat number or his heat identification, 
the manufacturer's name (see Note 1) or trademark, and 
this specification number, A 522 or A 522M as applicable, 
8Nl, or 9NI, and QT or NNT as applicable. 
NOTE 1 - For purposes of identification marking, the manufacturer 
is considered the organization that certifies the piping component was 
manufactured, sampled, and tested in accordance with this specification 
and the results have been determined to meet the requirements of this 
specification. 
15.2 Forgings impact tested at a temperature other than 
that specified in Table 3, by the use of Supplementary 
Requirement S2, shall be marked with the letters LTV 
following the specification number, as well as the tempera­
ture scale used. For forgings to A 522, these letters shall 
be followed by the impact test temperature in degrees 
Fahrenheit. A prefix 0 to the test temperature indicates a 
temperature below 0°F, for example A 522 Type 1 
LTV0300F indicates -300°F. For forgings to A 522M, the 
letters LTV shall be followed by the impact test tempera­
ture in degrees Celsius. A prefix 0 to the test temperature 
indicates a temperature below 0°C, for example A 522M 
Type 1 LTV0150C indicates -150°C.

14. Certification 
14.1 Test reports, when required, shall include certifi­
cation that all requirements of this specification have been 
met. The manufacturer shall provide the following where 
applicable: 
14.1.1 Whether Type 1 or Type 11 material has been 
supplied and the chemical analysis results in accordance 
with Section 5, 
14.1.2 Type of heat treatment used, 
14.1.3 Results of tension and Charpy impact tests 
(together with absorbed energy and % shear fracture)

15.4 Bar Coding - In addition to the requirements in 
15.1, 15.2, and 15.3, bar coding is acceptable as a supple­
mental identification method. The purchaser may specify 
in the order a specific bar coding system to be used. The 
bar coding system, if applied at the discretion of the sup­
plier, should be consistent with one of the published indus­
try standards for bar coding. If used on small parts, the 
bar code may be applied to the box or a substantially 
applied tag.
