6.3.4 Test Method -The wrap test shall be made in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
7. Metallurgical Requirements 
7.1 Su,face Condition: 
7.1.1 The surface of the wire as received shall be 
free of imperfections such as pits, die marks, scratches, 
seams, and other defects tending to impair the fatigue value 
of the springs. 
7.1.2 Number of Tests - One test specimen shall be 
taken from each end of every coil. 
7.1.3 Test Method - The surface shall be examined 
after etching in a solution of equal parts of hydrochloric 
acid and water that has been heated to approximately 80°C 
for a sufficient length of time to remove up to approxi­
mately 1 % of the diameter of the wire. Test ends shall be 
examined using 10 X magnification. 
7 .2 Decarburization: 
7.2.1 Transverse sections of the wire properly 
mounted, polished, and etched shall show no completely 
decarburized (carbon-free) areas when examined at a mag­
nification of 100 diameters. Partial decarburization shall 
not exceed a depth of 0.025 mm [0.001 in.] on wire 
5.00 mm [0.192 in.] and smaller or 0.038 mm [0.0015 in.] 
on larger than 5.00 mm [0.192 in.]. 
7.2.2 To reveal the decarburization more accurately 
in the untempered wire, the specimen shall be hardened 
and tempered before microscopical examination. Prior to 
hardening, the specimen shall be filed flat on one side 
enough to reduce the diameter at least 20%. The subsequent 
mounted specimen shall show the flattened section, as well 
as the original wire edge. Any decarburization on this 
flattened section shall necessitate a new specimen for exam­
ination.

c Fittings made from forgings may have 0.35 max carbon and 0.35 max silicon with no minimum. 
° For each reduction of 0.01 % below the specified carbon maximum, an increase of 0.06 % manganese above the specified maximum will be permitted, up to a maximum 
of 1.65 %. 
E The sum of Copper, Nickel, Chromium, and Molybdenum shall not exceed 1.00 %. 
FApplies both to heat and product analyses. 
GColumbium (Cb) and Niobium (Nb) are alternate names for element 41 in the Periodic Table of the Elements. 
HChromium Nickel Balance is defined as CNB = (Cr+ 6Si + 4Mo + 1.5W + 11 V + 5Nb + 9Ti + 12AI) - (40C + 30N + 4Ni + 2Mn + 1 Cu) 
that covers the area from the weld bevel of the branch outlet to 
the center line of the body or run. Internal and external surfaces 
shall be examined when size permits accessibility. No cracks 
shall be permitted. Other imperfections shall be treated in 
accordance with Section 15 on Surface Finish, Appearance, 
and Corrosion Protection. After the removal of any crack, the 
tee(s) shall be re-examined by the original method. Acceptable 
tees shall be marked with the symbol PT or MT, as applicable, 
to indicate compliance. 
Norn 1-The examination described in 7.6 exists because the great 
bulk of cold-forming strain-induced imperfections are detected in the area 
described. Subsection 7.6 does not waive other areas of a tee from meeting 
the requirements of Section 15 on Surface Finish, Appearance, and 
Corrosion Protection. 
7.7 Stubends may be produced with the entire lap added by 
the welding of a ring, made from plate or bar of the same alloy 
grade and composition, to the outside of a straight section of 
pipe, provided the weld is double welded, is a full penetration 
joint, satisfies the requirements of 7 .3 for qualifications and 
8.3.4 for post weld heat treatment. 
8. Heat Treatment 
8.1 Heat Treatment Procedures-Fittings, after forming at 
an elevated temperature, shall be cooled to a temperature 
below the critical range under suitable conditions to prevent 
injurious defects caused by too rapid cooling, but in no case 
more rapidly than the cooling rate in still air. Heat treatment 
temperatures specified are metal (part) temperatures. Heat­
treated fittings shall be treated according to Section 7 in 
Specification A960/A960M. 
8.2 WPB, WPC, and WPR Fittings: 
8.2.1 Hot-formed WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings upon 
which the final forming operation is completed at a temperature 
above 1150 °F [620 °C] and below 1800 °F [980 °C] need not 
be heat treated provided they are cooled in still air. 
8.2.2 Hot-formed or forged WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings 
finished at temperature in excess of 1800 °F [980 °C] shall 
subsequently be annealed, normalized, or normalized and 
tempered. Hot-forged fittings NPS 4 or smaller need not be 
heat treated. 
8.2.3 WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings over NPS 12, produced 
by locally heating a portion of the fitting stock to any 
temperature for forming, shall be subsequently annealed, 
normalized, or normalized and tempered. Fittings such as 
elbows, tees, header tees, reducers and lap joint stub ends with 
a carbon content less than 0.26 %, NPS 12 and under, shall not 
require heat treatment after forming a locally heated portion of 
the fitting. 
8.2.4 Cold-formed WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings, upon 
which the final forming operation is completed at a temperature 
below 1150 °F [620 °C], shall be normalized, or shall be stress 
relieved at 1100 to 1275 °F [595 to 690 °C]. 
8.2.5 WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings produced by fusion 
welding and having a nominal wall thickness at the welded 
joint of¾ in. [19 mm] or greater shall be post-weld heat treated 
at 1100 to 1250 °F [595 to 675 °C], or in accordance with 8.2.6. 
8.2.6 At the option of the manufacturer, WPB and WPC 
fittings produced by any of the methods in Section 7 may be 
annealed, normalized, or normalized and tempered. 
8.3 Fittings Other than WPB, WPC, and WPR: 
8.3.1 Fittings of Grades WPl, WPll Class 1, WPll Class 2, 
WPll Class 3, WP12 Class 1, WP12 Class 2, WP22 Class 1, 
WP22 Class 3, WPS, and WP9 shall be furnished in the 
annealed, isothermal-annealed, or normalized and tempered 
condition. If normalized and tempered, the tempering tempera­
ture for WPll Class 1, WPll Class 2, WPll Class 3, WP12 
Class 1, and WP12 Class 2 shall not be less than 1150 °F [620 
°C]; for Grades WPS, WP9, WP22 Class 1, and WP22 Class 3 
the tempering temperature shall not be less than 1250 °F [675 
oc]. 
331 
8.3.2 Fittings of Grades WPl, WP12 Class 1, or WP12 
Class 2 either hot formed or cold formed may be given a final 
heat treatment at 1200 °F [650 °C] instead of the heat treatment 
specified in 8.3.1. 
8.3.3 Fittings of WP24 either hot formed or cold formed 
shall be furnished in the normalized and tempered condition. 
The normalizing temperature range shall be 1800 to 1975 °F 
[980 to 1080 °C]. The tempering temperature range shall be 
1350 to 1470 °F [730 to 800 °C]. 
8.3.4 Fittings in all thiclmesses produced by fusion welding 
after the heat treatment specified in 8.3.1 shall be post-weld 
heat treated at a temperature not less than prescribed above for 
tempering except that Grade WPl Type 1 and Type 2 are 
required to be post-weld heat treated only when the nominal 
wall thickness at the welded joint is ½ in. [13 mm] or greater, 
and except that preheat and post weld heat treatment are not 
required for WP24 fittings whose section thickness does not 
exceed 0.500 in. [12.7 mm]. 
8.3.5 Except when Supplementary Requirement Sl is speci­
fied by the purchaser, Grade WP91 Type 1 and Type 2 shall be 
normalized at 1900 °F [1040 °C] minimum, and 1975 °F [1080 
°C] maximum, and tempered in the temperature range of 1350 
°F [730 °C] to 1470 °F [800 °C] as a final heat treatment. 
8.3.6 Grade WP911 shall be normalized in the temperature 
range of 1900 to 1975 °F [1040 to 1080 °C], and tempered in 
the temperature range of 1365 to 1435 °F [740 to 780 °C] as a 
final heat treatment. 
8.3.7 Grade WP92 shall be normalized at 1900 °F [1040 °C] 
minimum, and 1975 °F [1080 °C] maximum, and tempered in

the temperature range of 1350 °F [730 °C] to 1470 °F [800 °C] 
as a final heat treatment. 
8.3.8 Grade WP115 shall be normalized in the temperature 
range of 1920 °F [1050 °C] to 2010 °F [1100 °C]. 
8.4 WPB and WPC Fittings Made from Bar-Cold-finished 
bars reduced in cross-sectional area more than 10 % by cold 
drawing or cold rolling are not acceptable for use in the 
manufacture of these fittings unless the bars have been either 
stress relieved in the temperature range of 1100 to 1250 °F 
[595 to 675 °C], normalized, normalized and tempered, or 
annealed. Mechanical testing must be performed subsequent to 
the final heat-treating operation. 
8.5 Liquid quenching followed by tempering shall be per­
mitted for all grades when approved by the purchaser. Mini­
mum tempering temperature shall be 1100 °F [595 °C] for 
WPB, WPC, and WPR, 1150 °F [620 °C] for Grades WPl Type 
1 and Type 2, WPll Class 1, WPll Class 2, WP 12 Class 1, 
and WP12 Class 2 and 1250 °F [675 °C] for Grades WPS, 
WP9, WP22 Class 1, 1350 °F [730 °C] for both Grade WP91 
Type 1 and Type 2 and WP911 and 1380 °F [750 °C] for Grade 
WP115. The tempering temperature range for WP24 shall be as 
in 8.3.3. 
8.5.1 Liquid quenching followed by tempering for grades 
WPll Class 3 and WP22 Class 3 shall be permitted at the 
manufacturer's option unless otherwise provided in the pur­
chase order. The minimum tempering temperature for WPll 
Class 3 shall be 1150 °F [620 °C] and for WP22 Class 3 shall 
be 1250 °F [675 °C]. 
9. Chemical Composition 
9 .1 The chemical composition of each cast or heat used 
shall be determined and shall conform to the requirements of 
the chemical composition for the respective materials listed in 
Table 1. The ranges as shown have been expanded to include 
variations of the chemical analysis requirements that are listed 
in the various specifications for the starting materials (pipe, 
tube, plate, bar, and forgings) normally used in the manufac­
turing of fittings to this specification. 
9.2 The steel shall not contain any unspecified elements for 
the ordered grade to the extent that it conforms to the 
requirements of another grade for which that element is a 
specified element having a required minimum content. 
9.3 Weld metal used in the construction of carbon-steel 
fittings shall be mild steel analysis No. Al of Table QW-442, 
Section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, No. 
A2 may be used for Grade WPCW. 
9.4 The molybdenum and chromium content of the depos­
ited weld metal of alloy steel fittings shall be within the same 
percentage range as permitted for the base metal. 
9.5 Weld metal used in the construction of WP24 fittings 
shall be of the composition: 2.25 % Cr, 1 % Mo, 0.25 % V. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 The tensile properties of the fitting material shall 
conform to the requirements listed in Table 2. 
10.1.1 Longitudinal or transverse specimens cut from either 
a fitting or from the starting plate or pipe they were manufac-
tured from shall be acceptable for the tension test. For fittings 
made from forgings, the test specimen shall meet the require­
ments of Specification Al05/A105M for the tension test. 
10.1.2 While Table 2 specifies elongation requirements for 
both longitudinal and transverse specimens, it is not the intent 
that both requirements apply simultaneously. Instead, it is 
intended that only the elongation requirement that is appropri­
ate for the specimen used be applicable. 
10.2 One tension test shall be made on each heat of material 
and in the same condition of heat treatment as the finished 
fittings it represents. Where plate or pipe is used for the test 
specimen, the specimen thickness tested shall represent all 
fittings made from the same heat of material in the same heat 
treat condition in any thickness up to and including the tested 
thickness. Same heat treatment condition means that the same 
type of heat treatment (for example, stress relieve, normalize) 
and the same heat treating cycles (temperatures, time at 
temperature (minimum), temperature uniformity of ±25 °F 
[±14 °C], cooling method, etc.) are used (see 9.3 of Specifica­
tion A960/A960M for furnace uniformity requirement). 
10.3 When cold-formed fittings are furnished, samples of 
the raw material shall be normalized or stress relieved as 
required in 8.2.4. Tension tests conducted on these heat-treated 
samples shall be considered to be the tensile properties of the 
cold-formed fittings. 
10.4 Records of raw material test report of the tension tests 
shall be certification that the material of the fitting meets the 
tensile requirements of this specification provided the heat 
treatments of the finished fitting are the same as the raw 
material test report. If the raw material was not tested, or the 
fitting is not in the same condition of heat treatment, the fitting 
manufacturer shall perform the required test on material 
representative of the finished fitting from each heat of starting 
material. For fittings that are not heat treated in accordance 
with 8.2.1 or 8.2.3, the raw material test report data can be used 
to represent the fitting properties provided the heat treatments 
are the same. 
10.5 When testing of the finished fittings is requested by the 
purchaser, see Supplementary Requirement S51 in Specifica­
tion A960/ A960M. 
333 
11. Hardness 
11.1 Except when only one fitting is produced, and except 
for Grade WP91 Type 1 and Type 2, a minimum of two pieces 
per batch or continuous run shall be hardness tested to ensure 
the fittings are within the following limits for each grade in 
Table 2. The purchaser may verify that the requirement has 
been met by testing at any location on the fitting provided such 
testing does not render the fitting useless. 
11.1.1 Fittings of Grades WPS, WP9, and WPR-217 HBW 
maximum. 
11.1.2 Fittings of Grade WP24 and WP911-248 HBW 
maximum. 
11.1.3 Fittings of Grade WP92-269 HBW maximum. 
11.1.4 Fittings of all other grades-197 HBW maximum.

8 Yield strength shall be determined by the offset method at 0.2 % in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. Unless otherwise specified (see Specification A480/A480M, paragraph 4.1.11, Ordering 
Information), an alternative method of determining yield strength may be based on total extension under load of 0.5 %. 
c Either Brinell or denoted Rockwell Hardness scale is permissible. For thin materials, see Specification A480/A480M (17.2.1) and Test Methods A370 (18.1.2) on superficial testing. 
0 Bend tests are not required for chromium steels (ferritic or martensitic) thicker than 1 in. (25 mm] or for any austenitic or duplex (austenitic-ferritic) stainless steels regardless of thickness. 
£Elongation for thickness, less than 0.D15 in. (0.38 mm] shall be 20 % minimum, in 1 in. (25.4 mm]. 
F Common name, not a trademark, widely used, not associated with any one producer. 
G Yield strength requirements shall not apply to material under 0.020 in [0.50 mm] in thickness. 
H Not applicable for thicknesses under 0.010 in. (0.25 mm]. 
1 Type 201 is generally produced with a chemical composition balanced for rich side (Type 201-1) or lean side (Type 201-2) austenite stability depending on the properties required for specific applications. 
J Naming system developed and applied by ASTM. 
KFor S32615, the grain size as determined in accordance with the Test Methods E112, Comparison Method, Plate II, shall be No. 3 or finer. 
L Prior to Specification A240 - 89b, the tensile value for S32950 was 90 ksi. 
M S40900 (Type 409) has been replaced by S40910, S40920, and S40930. Unless otherwise specified in the ordering information, an order specifying S40900 or Type 409 shall be satisfied by any one of S40910, S40920, 
or S40930 at the option of the seller. Material meeting the requirements of S40910, S40920, or S40930, may at the option of the manufacturer be certified as S40900. 
N Material 0.050 in [1.27 mm] and under in thickness shall have a minimum elongation of 20 %. 
0 Hardness is required to be provided for information only, but is not required to meet a particular requirement. 
P The minimum elongation for plates thicker than 0.630 in. (16 mm) shall be 8 %. 
0 Maximum. Type 420 is usually used in the heat-treated condition (quenched and tempered to a specific range of hardness or tensile strength). 
R Hardness conversion tables for superduplex stainless steels do not exist in ASTM E140. The conversion value from HBW to HRC has been added to maintain consistency with other ASTM standards for these 
superduplex stainless steels.

SA-240/SA-240M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
A supplementary requirement shall apply only when specified in the purchase order. 
Sl. Charpy Impact Testing of Plate 
S 1.1 Charpy impact tests shall be conducted in accordance 
with Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
Sl.2 Number of Tests-One impact test (three specimens) 
shall be made from one plate per heat treatment lot in the final 
heat treated condition. 
Sl.3 Orientation of Test Specimens-Unless specified as 
transverse specimens (long axis of the specimen transverse to 
the final rolling direction, root of the notch perpendicular to the 
rolling face) on the purchase order, the orientation o~ the 
specimens shall be longitudinal (long axis of the spec11nen 
parallel to the final rolling direction, root of the_ notch ~erpen­
dicular to the rolling face). The manufacturer is permitted to 
test transverse specimens provided that such tests meet the 
acceptance criteria applicable to longitudinal specimen~. Un­
less otherwise specified on the purchase order, the specimens 
shall be taken so as to include the mid-thickness of the product. 
S 1 .4 Test Temperature-The purchaser shall specify the 
test temperature. The manufacturer is permitted to test speci­
mens at a temperature lower than that specified by the 
purchaser, provided that such tests shall meet the acceptance 
criteria applicable to specimens tested at the specified tempera­
ture (see the note below). 
Norn S 1.1-Test Methods A923, Method B, applicable to some duplex 
(austenitic-fen-itic) stainless steels as listed in Test ~ethods A923, uses a 
Charpy impact test for the purpose of detern:immg the absence of 
detrimental intermetallic phases. Method B specifies a test temperature 
and acceptance criterion, expressed as impact energy, for each type of 
steel covered. It may be economical for the Charpy impact tests performed 
on duplex stainless steels covered in both Specification A240 and _Test 
Methods A923 to be performed at the lower of the temperatures specified 
by this supplementary requirement and Test Methods A923 Method B, 
with measurement of both lateral expansion and impact energy. 
352 
S 1.5 Acceptance Limit-Unless otherwise specified on the 
purchase order, each of the three specimens tested shall sh~w 
a lateral expansion opposite the notch of not less than 0.015 m. 
[0.38 mm]. 
Sl.6 Records-The recorded results shall include the 
specimen orientation, specimen size, test temperature, ~b­
sorbed energy values (if required), and lateral expans10n 
opposite the notch. 
S2. Materials for High-Temperature Service 
S2.l Unless an H grade has been ordered, this supplemen­
tary requirement shall be specified for ASME Code applica­
tions for service above 1000°F [540°C]. 
S2.2 The user is permitted to use an austenitic stainless 
steel as the corresponding H grade when the material meets all 
requirements of the H grade including chemistry, annealing 
temperature, and grain size (see Section 6). . . 
S2.3 The user is permitted to use an L grade austemtic 
stainless steel for service above 1000°F [540°C], subject to the 
applicable allowable stress table of the ASME Code, when the 
material meets all requirements of this specification and the 
grain size is ASTM No. 7 or coarser as determined in 
accordance with Test Methods E112. The grain size shall be 
reported on a Certified Test Report. 
S3. One Percent Offset Yield Strength 
S3 .1 If reporting of 1 % offset yield strength is specified on 
the purchase order; the material shall meet the strength 
requirements shown in Table S3.1. . 
S3.2 The mechanical properties, including 1 % offset yield 
strength and all other required properties shall be reported on 
a Material Test Report.

welded tubes and heavily cold worked welded tubes made from 
the austenitic steels listed in Table 1, with various grades 
intended for such use as boiler, superheater, heat exchanger, or 
condenser tubes. 
1.2 Grades TP304H, TP309H, TP309HCb, TP310H, 
TP310HCb, TP316H, TP321H, TP347H, and TP348H are 
modifications of Grades TP304, TP309S, TP309Cb, TP310S, 
TP310Cb, TP316, TP321, TP347, and TP348, and are intended 
for high-temperature service such as for superheaters and 
reheaters. 
1.3 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter to 12 in. 
[304.8 mm] in outside diameter and 0.015 to 0.320 in. [0.4 to 
8.1 mm], inclusive, in wall thickness. Tubing having other 
dimensions may be furnished, provided such tubes comply 
with all other requirements of this specification. 
1.4 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.5 Optional supplementary requirements are provided and, 
when one or more of these are desired, each shall be so stated 
in the order. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.7 The following safety hazards caveat pertains only to the 
test method described in the Supplementary Requirements of 
this specification. This standard does not purport to address all 
of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. A 
specific warning statement is given in Supplementary Require­
ment S7, Note S7.1. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material welded tubes (WLD) or heavily cold 
worked tubes (HCW), 
3.1.3 Grade (Table 1), 
3.1.4 Size (outside diameter and nominal wall thickness), 
3.1.5 Length (specific or random), 
3.1.6 Optional requirements (13.6), 
3.1.7 Test report required (see Certification Section of 
Specification A1016/A1016M), 
3.1.8 Specification designation, and 
3.1.9 Special requirements and any supplementary require­
ments selected. 
3.1.9.1 If Supplementary Requirement S7 is specified, in­
clude weld decay ratio per S 11.1.1. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A1016/Al016M, unless otherwise provided 
herein. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 The welded (WLD) tubes shall be made from flat-rolled 
steel by an automatic welding process with no addition of filler 
metal. 
5.1.l Subsequent to welding and prior to final heat 
treatment, the tubes shall be cold worked either in both weld 
and base metal or in weld metal only. The method of cold 
working may be specified by the purchaser. When cold drawn, 
the purchaser may specify the minimum amount of reduction in 
cross-sectional area or wall thickness, or both. 
5.1.2 Heavily cold worked (HCW) tubes shall be made by 
applying cold working of not less than 35 % reduction in both 
wall and weld to a welded tube prior to the final anneal. No 
filler metal shall be used in the making of the weld. Prior to 
cold working, the weld shall be 100 % radiographically in­
spected in accordance with the requirements of ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1, latest 
revision, Paragraph UW 51. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 All material shall be furnished in the heat-treated 
condition in accordance with the requirements of Table 2. 
6.2 A solution annealing temperature above 1950 °F [1065 
0 C] may impair the resistance to intergranular corrosion after 
subsequent exposure to sensitizing conditions in TP309HCb, 
TP310HCb, TP321, TP321H, TP347, TP347H, TP348, and 
TP348H. When specified by the purchaser, a lower temperature 
stabilization or re-solution anneal shall be used subsequent to 
the initial high temperature solution anneal (see Supplementary 
Requirement S4). 
6.3 N08020 shall be supplied in the stabilization treatment 
condition. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The heat analysis shall conform to the requirements as 
to chemical composition given in Table 1. 
8. Product Analysis 
8.1 An analysis of either one length of flat-rolled stock or 
one tube shall be made for each heat. The chemical composi­
tion thus determined shall conform to the requirements given in 
Section 7. 
8.2 A product analysis tolerance of Table Al.I in Specifi­
cation A480/ A480M shall apply. The product analysis toler­
ance is not applicable to the carbon content for material with a 
specified maximum carbon of 0.04 % or less. 
8.3 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be 
made. Both retests for the elements in question shall meet the 
requirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot (See 13.9.1) shall be rejected or, at 
the option of the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or 
tube may be individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of 
flat-rolled stock or tubes that do not meet the requirements of 
the specification shall be rejected. 
360 
9. Tensile Requirements 
9 .1 The material shall conform to the tensile properties 
prescribed in Table 3. 
10. Hardness Requirements 
10.1 The tubes shall have a Rockwell hardness number not 
exceeding the values specified in Table 3. 
10.2 For tubing less than 0.354 in. [9.00 mm] in inside 
diameter and for tubing less than 0.065 in. [1.65 mm] in wall 
thickness, it is permissible to use the Vickers hardness test in 
lieu of the Rockwell test. Tubes shall have a Vickers hardness 
number not exceeding the values specified in Table 3. 
11. Reverse-Bend Test Requirement 
11.1 A section 4 in. [100 mm] minimum in length shall be 
split longitudinally 90° on each side of the weld. The sample 
shall then be opened and bent around a mandrel with a 
maximum thickness of four times the wall thickness, with the 
mandrel parallel to the weld and against the original outside 
surface of the tube. The weld shall be at the point of maximum 
bend. There shall be no evidence of cracks, or of overlaps 
resulting from the reduction in thickness of the weld areas by 
cold working. When the geometry or size of the tubing make it

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
. ~e following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the 
mqmry, contract, or order. 
Sl. Stress-Relieved Annealed Tubes 
S 1.1 For use in certain corrosives, particularly chlorides 
where stres~ corrosion may occur, tubes in Grades TP304L, 
TP316L, TP321, TP347, and TP348 may be specified in the 
stress-relieved annealed condition. Details of these supplemen­
tal requirements shall be agreed upon by the manufacturer and 
the purchaser. 
S 1.2 When stress-relieved tubes are specified, tubes shall be 
given a heat treatment at 1550 to 1650 °F [845 to 900 °C] after 
roll straightening. Cooling from this temperature range may be 
either in air or by slow cooling. No mechanical straightening is 
permitted after the stress-relief treatment. 
S 1.3 Straightness of the tubes shall be a matter of negotiation 
between the purchaser and manufacturer. 
S2. Minimum Wall Tubes 
S2.1 When specified by the purchaser, tubes shall be fur­
nished on a minimum wall basis. Such tubes shall satisfy the 
minimum wall thickness requirements of Specification A1016/ 
Al016M rather than the nominal wall requirements of this 
specification. In ~ddition to the marking required by Section 
18, the tubing shall be marked S2. 
S3. Pneumatic Test 
S3.1 The tubing shall be examined by a pneumatic test 
(either air under water or pneumatic leak test) in accordance 
with Specification A1016/Al016M. 
S4. Stabilizing Heat Treatment 
S4.1 Subsequent to the solution anneal required in Section 
6, Grades TP309HCb, TP310HCb, TP321, TP321H, TP347, 
TP347H, TP348, and TP348H shall be given a stabilization 
heat treatment at a temperature lower than that used for the 
initial solution annealing heat treatment. The temperature of 
stabilization heat treatment shall be at a temperature as agreed 
upon between the purchaser and vendor. 
SS. DELETED 
S6. Intergranular Corrosion Test 
S6.l When specified, material shall pass intergranular cor­
rosion tests conducted by the manufacturer in accordance with 
Practices A262, Practice E. 
NoTE S6.1-Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condition for 
low carbon or stabilized grades, and on the as-shipped condition for other 
grades. 
S6.2 A stabilization heat treatment in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement S4 may be necessary and is 
permitted in order to meet this requirement for the grades 
containing titanium or columbium, particularly in their H 
versions. 
364 
87. Weld Decay Test 
S7.1 This test is not applicable to alloys with a nickel 
content 2:: 19.0 % or a molybdenum content 2:: 4.00 %, or both. 
Norn S7.1-Toe weld decay test is sensitive for the presence of delta 
ferrite in the weld material. Increasing amounts of delta ferrite will result 
in a higher ratio as defined in S7 .10. Alloys with the high nickel or 
molybdenum content of S7 .1 may not form delta fenite and therefore may 
not be sensitive to this test. 
S7.2 When specified by the purchase order, one sample 
from each lot of tubing (See 13.9.2) shall be subjected to 
testing in a boiling mixture of 50 % reagent grade hydrochloric 
acid and 50 % water. 
S7 .3 Approximately 2-in. long samples shall be prepared 
from a production length of tubing. Shorter, 1-in. samples may 
be used for small diameter (½-in. and below) tubing. Split the 
sample longitudinally to allow for easy micrometer measure­
ments. The sample may be one piece which contains the weld 
and at least 90° of base-metal to one side of the weld. 
Alternately, the sample may be two separate pieces with one 
containing the weld and a similar size section from the balance 
of the tube opposite the weld consisting of 100 % base metal. 
Remove all burrs and sharp edges by lightly grinding. Remove 
dust and grease by cleaning with soap and water or other 
suitable solvents. Then, place sample(s) in the flask. It is not 
recommended to test more than four samples together, or to 
mix alloy types. 
S7.4 Prepare the hydrochloric acid solution by slowly add­
ing reagent grade (approximately 37 %) hydrochloric acid to 
an equal volume of distilled water. (Warning-Protect eyes 
and use rubber gloves when handling acid. Mixing shall be 
done under a hood and testing shall be run under a hood.) 
S7.5 The test container shall be a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask 
equipped with ground-glass joints and an Ahlin condenser. The 
volume of the solution shall be approximately 700 mL. 
S7 .6 Measure the thickness of the tube at five locations 
along the weld area and at five locations along the base-metal 
section. In both cases, take measurements at approximately 
equal longitudinal intervals along the section lengths. Make 
these measurements with a sharp pointed micrometer accurate 
to at least 0.001 in. The micrometer must be suitable for 
measuring the small features in the surface after testing. 
Typical pin micrometers have tapered anvils with a tip radius 
of less than 0.015 in. 
S7.7 Immerse the samples into the solution. Add boiling 
chips and bring to a boil. Allow the chips to remain boiling 
throughout the test. The time of testing shall be that which is 
required to remove 40 to 60 % of the original base-metal

=== Page 417 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-249 /SA-249M 
thickness (usually 2 h or less). If more than 60 % of the 
base-metal thickness remains, the sample may be removed 
after 24 h. 
S7 .8 At the end of the test period, remove the samples from 
the solution, rinse with distilled water, and dry. 
S7.9 After exposure to the test solution, repeat the tube­
thickness measurement as in S7.6. If the thinning is not 
uniform across the width of the weld, then two sets of 
weld-metal measurement are required. One set of measure­
ments is to be taken along the centerline of the weld. The 
second set of measurements is to be taken in the thinnest area 
of the weld. 
S7 .10 Calculate the corrosion ratio, R, for both sections of 
the weld as follows in Eq 1: 
where: 
R= WO -w 
B 0 -B 
W 0 = average weld-metal thickness before the test, 
W = average weld-metal thickness after the test, 
B 0 = average base-metal thickness before the test, and 
B = average base-metal thickness after the test. 
S7.11 Acceptance Criteria: 
(1) 
S7 .11.1 The ratio of the thinnest section of the weld and 
adjacent heat affected zone versus the base metal shall be 
determined. The following ratios or alternatives are commonly 
specified: 
S7.ll.l.1 A corrosion ratio of 1.25 or less. If not specified 
by the purchase order, this is the default criteria. 
S7.ll.l.2 A corrosion ratio of 1.00 or less. 
S7.11.1.3 Alternative ratios may be agreed between the 
purchaser and supplier. 
S8. Special Applications 
S8.1 For special applications, such as hydraulic expansion 
of tubes into tube sheets, dimensions of the weld shape and 
thickness shall be per agreement between the purchaser and 
supplier. Tubes ordered to this requirement shall bear the 
additional marking of NB. 
S9. Additional Testing of Welded Tubing for ASME Re­
quirements 
S9.l. When this supplement is specified in the purchase 
order, in certain ASME applications it is permissible to use 
100 % joint efficiency for longitudinal weld, provided the 
following additional requirements are met: 
S9.l.1 Each tube shall be subjected to an ultrasonic inspec­
tion employing Practices E273 or E213 with the rejection 
criteria referenced in Specification A1016/Al016M. 
S9.l.2 If Practice E273 is employed, a 100 % volumetric 
inspection of the entire length of each tube shall also be 
performed using one of the nondestructive electric tests per­
mitted by Specification A1016/A1016M. 
S9.l.3 The test methods described in the supplement may 
not be capable of inspecting the end portions of tubes. This 
condition is referred to as end effect. This portion, as deter­
mined by the manufacturer, shall be removed and discarded. 
S9.l.4 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A1016/Al016M, "S9" shall be added after the grade designa­
tion. 
ND'rE S9.1-When specified, the special testing in this supplement is 
intended for special ASME applications. It is not mandatory for all ASME 
applications.

SA-250/SA-ZS0M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Ferritic Alloy-Steel Boiler and 
Superheater Tubes 
1. Scope 
1. l This specification covers several grades, designated Tl, 
Tla, Tlb, T2, Tll, Tl2 and T22, of minimum-wall-thickness, 
electric-resistance-welded, carbon-molybdenum and 
chromium-molybdenum alloy-steel, boiler and superheater 
tubes. 
1.2 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are ½ to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside 
diameter and 0.035 to 0.320 in. [0.9 to 8.1 mm], inclusive, in 
minimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may 
be furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.4 An optional supplementary requirement is provided for 
non-destructive examination for certain ASME applications. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be reaagrded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.5.1 Within the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. 
1.5.2 The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order.
