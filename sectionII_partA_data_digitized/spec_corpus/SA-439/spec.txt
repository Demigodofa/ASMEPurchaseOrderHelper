SA-439/SA-439M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Austenitic Ductile Iron Castings 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers austenitic ductile iron castings, 
which are used primarily for their resistance to heat, conosion, 
and wear, and for other special purposes. 
1.2 Austenitic ductile iron, also known as austenitic nodular 
iron or austenitic spheroidal iron, is characterized by having its 
graphite substantially in a spheroidal form and substantially 
free of flake graphite. It contains some carbides and sufficient 
alloy content to produce an austenitic structure. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the standard. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for material to this specification shall include the 
following information: 
3.1.1 ASTM designation, 
3.1.2 Type of austenitic ductile iron required (see 6.1), 
3.1.3 Heat treatment options (see 4.3 - 4.6), 
3.1.4 DELETED 
3.1.5 Size and number of test bars required (see 9.1 - 9.4 
and 10.1), 
3.1.6 Special tests, if required (see 12.1), 
3.1.7 DELETED 
3.1.8 Different preparation for delivery requirements, if 
needed (see 15.1). 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 Melting may be done in any furnaces that produce 
castings meeting the chemical and mechanical requirements 
outlined in this specification. These include cupolas, air 
furnaces, electric furnaces, crucible furnaces, and so forth. 
Nodularizing and inoculation practice shall be optional with 
the foundry to produce a microstructure in accordance with 1.2 
and Test Method A24 7. 
4.2 Austenitic ductile iron castings may be supplied in 
either the as-cast or the heat-treated condition. 
4.3 By agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser, the castings may be stress relieved by heating to 
1150 to 1200 °F [620 to 650 °C] for not less than 1 h and not 
for more than 2 h per inch [25 mm] of thickness in the thickest 
section. Heating and cooling shall be uniform and shall not be 
more than 400 °FAl [220 °CA1] for castings less than 1 in. 
[25 mm] in maximum thickness and shall be not more than 
400 °FAl [220 °CA1] divided by the maximum section thick­
ness in inches [25 mm] for thicker castings. During the cooling

=== Page 773 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-439 /SA-439M 
cycle, castings may be cooled in still air after the temperature 
has dropped to 600 °F [310 °C]. 
4.4 By agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser, the castings may be in-mold stress relieved by 
allowing castings to cool slowly in the mold at a rate not 
exceeding 400 °FAi [220 °CAi]. Once the temperature has 
dropped below 600 °F [310 °C], castings can be removed from 
the mold and cooled in still air. 
4.5 Whenever dimensional changes in high-temperature 
service are a problem, by agreement between the manufacturer 
and the purchaser, the castings may be stabilized by heating at 
1600 °F [870 °C] for a period of 1 h per inch [25 mm] of 
section, with a minimum period of 1 h, followed by uniform 
cooling, preferably in still air. Otherwise, the austenite, which 
is super saturated with respect to carbon, can reject carbon 
during service and produce dimensional changes. 
4.6 By agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser, castings with chilled edges or excessive carbides 
may be annealed at 1750 to 1900 °F [960 to 1040 °C] for 0.5 h 
to 5 h followed by uniform cooling, preferably in still air. 
4. 7 Repair by welding, plugging, or other methods is not 
permitted. 
5. Magnetic Properties 
5.1 In the event that nonmagnetic castings are specified, the 
magnetic permeability test shall be used. The maximum 
magnetic permeability value shall be agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
Norn 1-A convenient shop test for differentiating the various types of 
austenitic ductile iron is based on the fact that a ground face of either the 
test bar or the castings of Types D-2 and D-2C does not attract a small 
steel horseshoe-type magnet which is normally attracted to steel (Alnico 
magnet should not be used). Types D-3, D-3A, D-5, and D-5B are 
attracted, and types D-2B, D-2S, D-4, and D-5S are slightly attracted. This 
nonmagnetic test is a convenient qualitative test only for Types D-2 and 
D-2C, and shall not be used as a basis for acceptance. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 Many combinations of alloys can be used to obtain an 
austenitic ductile iron. This specification includes ten general 
types defined by the composition limits in Table 1. 
6.2 Samples taken from test coupons, broken test 
specimens, or castings shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. Sampling shall be 
conducted in accordance with Practice E59 and chemical 
analyses in accordance with Test Methods E351 and E30. Test 
Methods E30 should only be used for analyzing those elements 
for which specific coverage is not provided for in Test Methods 
E351. 
6.3 Spectrometric techniques may also be used for analysis, 
but should a dispute arise concerning chemical composition, 
Test Methods E351 and E30 shall be used for referee methods. 
6.4 The chemical analysis for total carbon shall be made on 
either chilled cast pencil-type specimens or thin wafers ap­
proximately v.~2 in. [1.0 mm] thick cut from test coupons. 
Drillings shall not be used because of attendant loss of 
graphite. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7 .1 Test specimens of austenitic ductile iron made according 
to this specification shall meet the test requirements prescribed 
in Table 2. 
7 .2 The yield strength shall be determined in accordance 
with Test Methods E8/E8M, using one of the following 
procedures: the 0.2 % offset method or the extension-under­
load method may be used, by agreement between the purchaser 
and the manufacturer. 
7.3 Brinell hardness shall be determined as HBW 10/3000 
in accordance with Test Method ElO. 
8. Workmanship, Fiuish, and Appearance 
8.1 The castings shall conform substantially to the dimen­
sions on the drawings furnished by the purchaser, or if no 
drawing has been provided, to the dimensions predicated by 
the pattern supplied by the purchaser. The castings shall be free 
of injurious defects. Surfaces of the castings shall be free of 
burnt-on sand and shall be reasonably smooth. Runners, risers, 
fins, and other cast-on pieces shall be removed. In other 
respects, the castings shall conform to whatever points are 
specifically agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
9. Test Bars 
9.1 The standard test bars shall be the 1-in. [25-mm] "Y" 
block and 1-in. [25-mm] keel block as shown in Figs. 1 and 2,

shall be made to the dimensions shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 of 
Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
9.5 Test bars representing the furnace heat of iron shall be 
cast from the same ladle of metal as soon as practicable after 
the last iron is poured to produce castings, unless otherwise 
specified. Test bars shall be left in the mold until they have 
cooled to less than 930 °F [500 °C]; cooling to a black 
appearance is acceptable if the manufacturer has established 
that such black appearance corresponds to a temperature less 
than 930 °F [500 °C]. 
10. Number of Tests

nodularizing agent, unless otherwise specified. 
10.2 The number of test bars cast shall be agreed upon by 
the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
10.3 One tension test shall be made from sections cut from 
the test bars as shown in Fig. 4. If any tension test shows 
obvious foundry or machining defects, another specimen shall 
be cut from the same test bar or from another test bar 
representing the same metal. If the retest specimen fails to 
conform to this specification, the castings they represent shall 
be rejected. 
11. Tension Test Specimens 
11.1 The standard round tension test specimen with 2-in. 
[50-rnm] gauge length shown in Fig. 5 shall be used, except 
when the ½-in. [13-mm] "Y" block is used or when specimens 
are cut from castings under ¾-in. [20-rnm] thickness. In these 
cases, either of the test specimens shown in Fig. 6 shall be 
satisfactory. 
11.2 By agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser, tension test specimens may be cut directly from 
centrifugal or other permanent mold castings. The location and 
orientation of such tension test specimens cut from castings 
shall be specified as agreed upon by the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
12. Additional Tests 
12.1 Hydrostatic tests for pressure castings, radiography 
standards, fracture tests, microstructure standards, or any other 
special tests may be set up by mutual agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
13. Responsibility for Inspection 
13.1 Unless otherwise specified in the contract or purchase 
order, the manufacturer is responsible for the performance of 
all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as 
otherwise specified in the contract or order, the manufacturer 
may use their own or any other facilities suitable for the 
performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, 
unless disapproved by the purchaser. The purchaser reserves 
the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the 
specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to 
ensure supplies and services conform to prescribed require­
ments. 
14. Certification 
14.1 A certification shall be made the basis of acceptance of 
the material. This shall consist of a copy of the manufacturer's 
test report or a statement by the supplier, accompanied by a 
copy of the test results that the material has been tested and 
inspected in accordance with the provisions of this specifica­
tion. Each certification so furnished shall be signed by an 
authorized agent of the supplier or manufacturer. 
15. Packaging and Package Marking 
15.1 Unless otherwise specified in the contract or purchase 
order, preservation and packaging of casting shall be in 
accordance with the manufacturer's commercial practice.

1.2 One or more of Sections 6.3, 7, 8, 19, 20, 21, 22, 22.1, 
24, and 25 apply when the product specification or purchase 
order has a requirement for the test or analysis described by 
these sections. 
1.3 In case of conflict between a requirement of the product 
specification and a requirement of this general requirement 
specification only the requirement of the product specification 
need be satisfied. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
738 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation (SI) of the product specification is specified in the 
order. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the

3.1.1 remelted heat-in secondary melting, all of the ingots 
remelted from a single primary heat. 
3.1.2 thin-wall tube-a tube meeting the specified outside 
diameter and specified wall thickness set forth as follows: 
Specified Outside Specified Wall Thickness 
Diameter 
2 in. [50.8 mm] or less 2 % or less of specified outside diameter 
Greater than 2 in. [50.8 mm] 3 % or less of specified outside diameter 
Any 0.020 in. [0.5 mm] or less 
3.2 Other defined terms-The definitions in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370, Test Methods, Practices, and Terminol­
ogy A751, and Terminology A941 are applicable to this 
specification and to those listed in 1. 1. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order all ordering information necessary to purchase 
the needed material. Examples of such infonnation include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
4.1.2 Specificiation number with grade or class, or both, as 
applicable and year date, 
4.1.3 Manufacture (hot-finished or cold-finished), 
4.1.4 Size (outside diameter and minimum wall thickness), 
4.1.5 Length (specific or random), 
4.1.6 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test 
Methods A1058 when material is ordered to an M suffix (SI 
units) product standard. If the choice of test track is not 
specified in the order, then the default ASTM test track shall be 
used as noted in Test Methods A1058. 
4.1.7 Supplementary Requirements, and 
4.1.8 Additional requirements. 
5. Process 
5.1 The steel may be made by any process. 
5.2 If a specific type of melting is required by the purchaser, 
it shall be as stated on the purchase order. 
739 
5.3 The primary melting may incorporate separate degas­
sing or refining and may be followed by secondary melting, 
such as electroslag remelting or vacuum-arc remelting. 
5.4 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When 
steel of different grades is sequentially strand cast, identifica­
tion of the resultant transition material is required. The 
producer shall remove the transition material by an established 
procedure that positively separates the grades. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 Samples for chemical analysis, and method of analysis 
shall be in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, and 
Terminology A751. 
6.2 Heat Analysis-If the heat analysis reported by the steel 
producer is not sufficiently complete for conformance with the 
heat analysis requirements of the applicable product specifica­
tion to be fully assessed, the manufacturer may complete the 
assessment of conformance with such heat analysis require­
ments by using a product analysis for the specified elements 
that were not reported by the steel producer, provided that 
product analysis tolerances are not applied and the heat 
analysis is not altered.

=== Page 790 ===

SA-450 /SA-450M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
6.3 Product Analysis-Product analysis requirements and 
options, if any, are contained in the product specification. 
7. Tensile Properties 
7 .1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in the individual specification. 
7 .2 The yield strength corresponding to a permanent offset 
of 0.2 % of the gage length or to a total extension of 0.5 % of 
the gage length under load shall be determined. 
7.3 If the percentage of elongation of any test specimen is 
less than that specified and any part of the fracture is more than 
¾ in. [19.0 mm] from the center of the gage length, as 
indicated by scribe marks on the specimen before testing, a 
retest shall be allowed. 
8. Standard Weights 
8.1 The calculated weight per unit length, based upon a 
specified minimum wall thickness, shall be determined by the 
following equation: 
W= C(D - t)t 
where: 
C = 10.69 [0.0246615], 
W == weight, lb/ft [kg/m], 
D = specified outside diameter, in. [mm], and 
t = specified minimum wall thickness, in. [mm) 
(1) 
8.2 The permissible variations from the calculated weight 
per foot [kilogram per metre] shall be as prescribed in Table 1. 
9. Permissible Variations in Wall Thickness 
9.1 Variations from the specified minimum wall thickness 
shall not exceed the amounts prescribed in Table 2. 
9.2 For tubes 2 in. [50.8 mm] and over in outside diameter 
and 0.220 in. [5.6 mm] and over in thickness, the variation in 
wall thickness in any one cross section of any one tube shall 
not exceed the following percentage of the actual mean wall at 
the section. The actual mean wall is defined as the average of 
the thickest and thinnest wall in that section. 
Seamless tubes ± 10 % 
Welded tubes ±5 % 
9.3 When cold-finished tubes as ordered require wall thick­
nesses¾ in. [19.1 mm] or over, or an inside diameter 60 % or 
less of the outside diameter, the permissible variations in wall 
thickness for hot-finished tubes shall apply.

10. Permissible Variations in Outside Diameter 
10.1 Except as provided in 10.2, variations from the speci­
fied outside diameter shall not exceed the amounts prescribed 
in Table 3. 
10.2 Thin-wall tubes usually develop significant ovality (out 
of roundness) during final annealing, or straightening, or both. 
The diameter tolerances of Table 3 are not sufficient to provide 
for additional ovality expected in thin-wall tubes, and, for such 
tubes, are applicable only to the mean of the extreme (maxi­
mum and minimum) outside diameter readings in any one cross 
section. However, for thin wall tubes the difference in extreme 
outside diameter readings (ovality) in any one cross section 
shall not exceed the following ovality allowances:

A In determining the ratio of inside diameter to specified outside diameter, the 
inside diameter shall be defined as the actual mean inside diameter of the material 
tested. 
22. Flange Test 
22.1 A section of tube shall be capable of having a flange 
turned over at a right angle to the body of the tube without 
cracking or showing imperfections rejectable under the provi­
sions of the product specification. The width of the flange for 
carbon and alloy steels shall be not less than the percentages 
specified in Table 6. 
23. Hardness Test 
23.1 For tubes 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] and over in wall 
thickness, either the Brinell or Rockwell hardness test shall be 
used. When Brinell hardness testing is used, a 10-mm ball with 
3000, 1500, or 500-kg load, or a 5-mm ball with 750-kg load 
may be used, at the option of the manufacturer. 
742 
23.2 For tubes less than 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] to and including 
0.065 in. [1.7 mm] in wall thickness, the Rockwell hardness 
test shall be used. 
23.3 For tubes less than 0.065 in. [1.7 mm] in wall 
thickness, the hardness test shall not be required. 
23.4 The Brinell hardness test may be made on the outside 
of the tube near the end, on the outside of a specimen cut from 
the tube, or on the wall cross section of a specimen cut from the 
tube at the option of the manufacturer. This test shall be made 
so that the distance from the center of the impression to the 
edge of the specimen is at least 2.5 times the diameter of the 
impression. 
23.5 The Rockwell hardness test may be made on the inside 
surface, on the wall cross section, or on a flat on the outside 
surface at the option of the manufacturer. 
23.6 For tubes furnished with upset, swaged, or otherwise 
formed ends, the hardness test shall be made as prescribed in 
23.1 and 23.2 on the outside of the tube near the end after the 
forming operation and heat treatment. 
23.7 For welded or brazed tubes, the hardness test shall be 
made away from the joints. 
23.8 When the product specification provides for Vickers 
hardness, such testing shall be in accordance with Test Method 
E92. 
24. Hydrostatic Test 
24.1 Except as provided in 24.2 and 24.3, each tube shall be 
tested by the manufacturer to a minimum hydrostatic test 
pressure determined by the following equation:

seen or detected by a loss of pressure. This test may not detect 
very tight, through-the-wall defects or defects that extend an 
appreciable distance into the wall without complete penetra­
tion. 
26.2.6 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
products. 
26.3 Time of Examination-Nondestructive examination for 
specification acceptance shall be performed after all deforma­
tion processing, heat treating, welding, and straightening op­
erations. This requirement does not preclude additional testing 
at earlier stages in the processing. 
26.4 Surface Condition: 
26.4.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, paint, 
or other foreign material that could interfere with interpretation 
of test results. The methods used for cleaning and preparing the 
surfaces for examination shall not be detrimental to the base 
metal or the surface finish. 
26.4.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can 
produce signals that interfere with the test. 
26.5 Extent of Examination: 
26.5.l The relative motion of the tube and the transducer(s), 
coil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire tube smiace is 
scanned, except for end effects as noted in 26.5.2. 
26.5.2 The existence of end effects is recognized, and the 
extent of such effects shall be determined by the manufacturer, 
and, if requested, shall be reported to the purchaser. Other 
nondestructive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
26.6 Operator Qualifications: 
26.6.1 The test unit operator shall be certified in accordance 
with SNT-TC-lA, or an equivalent documented standard 
agreeable to both purchaser and manufacturer. 
26.7 Test Conditions: 
26.7.1 For examination by the ultrasonic method, the mini­
mum nominal transducer frequency shall be 2.0 MHz, and the 
maximum transducer size shall be 1.5 in. [38 mm]. 
26.7.2 For eddy current testing, the excitation coil fre­
quency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration, yet 
provide good signal-to-noise ratio. 
26.7.2.1 The maximum coil frequency shall be: 
Specified Wall Thickness 
<0.050 in. 
0.050 to 0.150 
>0.150 
26.8 Reference Standards: 
Maximum Frequency 
100 KHz

26.8.1 Reference standards of convenient length shall be 
prepared from a length of tube of the same grade, specified size 
(outside diameter and wall thickness), surface finish and heat 
treatment condition as the tubing to be examined. 
26.8.2 For eddy current testing, the reference standard shall 
contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following discontinuities: 
26.8.2.1 Drilled Hole-The reference standard shall contain 
three or more holes, equally spaced circumferentially around 
the tube and longitudinally separated by a sufficient distance to 
allow distinct identification of the signal from each hole. The 
holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the tube 
wall, with care being taken to avoid distortion of the tube while 
drilling. The holes shall not be larger than 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] 
in diameter. As an alternative, the producer may choose to drill 
one hole and run the calibration standard through the test coil 
three times, rotating the tube approximately 120° each time. 
More passes with smaller angular increments may be used, 
provided testing of the full 360° of the coil is obtained. For 
welded tubing, if the weld is visible, one of the multiple holes 
or the single hole shall be drilled in the weld. 
26.8.2.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool 
or file with a ¼ in. [6.4 mm] diameter, a notch shall be milled 
or filed tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the tube. Said notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. 
26.8.2.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
tube axis on the outside surface of the tube, to have a depth not 
exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
26.8.3 For ultrasonic testing, the reference ID and OD 
notches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes 
shown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The 
depth of the notches shall not exceed 12½ % of the specified 
wall thickness of the tube or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is 
greater. The width of the notch shall not exceed two times the 
depth. For welded tubing, the notches shall be placed in the 
weld, if the weld is visible. 
26.8.4 For flux leakage testing, the longitudinal reference 
notches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a radial 
plane parallel to the tube axis on the inside and outside surfaces 
of the tube. Notch depth shall not exceed 12½ % of the 
specified wall thickness or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is 
greater. Notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25.4 mm], and the 
width shall not exceed the depth. Outside and inside notches 
shall have sufficient separation to allow distinct identification 
of the signal from each notch. 
744 
26.8.5 More or smaller reference discontinuities, or both, 
may be used by agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
26.9 Standardization Procedure: 
26.9.1 The test apparatus shall be standardized at the 
beginning and end of each series of tubes of the same specified 
size (diameter and wall thickness), grade and heat treatment 
condition, and at intervals not exceeding 4 h during the 
examination of such tubing. More frequent standardizations 
may be performed at the manufacturer's option or may be 
required upon agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
26.9.2 The test apparatus shall also be standardized after 
any change in test system settings, change of operator, equip­
ment repair, or intem1ption due to power loss or shutdown.

=== Page 795 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-450/SA-450M 
26.9.3 The reference standard shall be passed through the 
test apparatus at the same speed and test system settings as the 
tube to be tested, except that, at the manufacturer's discretion, 
the tubes may be tested at a higher sensitivity. 
26.9.4 The signal-to-noise ratio for the reference standard 
shall be 2.5:1 or greater, and the reference signal amplitude for 
each discontinuity shall be at least 50 % of full scale of the 
display. In establishing the noise level, extraneous signals from 
identifiable surface impe1fections on the reference standard 
may be ignored. When reject filtering is used during UT 
testing, linearity must be demonstrated. 
26.9.5 If, upon any standardization, the reference signal 
amplitude has decreased by 29 % (3.0 dB), the test apparatus 
shall be considered out of standardization. The test system 
settings may be changed, or the transducer(s), coil(s), or 
sensor(s) adjusted, and the unit restandardized, but all tubes 
tested since the last acceptable standardization must be re­
tested. 
26.10 Evaluation of Imperfections: 
26.10.1 Tubing producing a test signal to or greater than the 
lowest signal produced by the reference standard shall be 
designated suspect, shall be clearly marked or identified, and 
shall be separated from the acceptable tubing. 
26.10.2 Such suspect tubing shall be subject to one of the 
following three dispositions: 
26.10.2.1 The tubes may be rejected without further 
examination, at the discretion of the manufacturer. 
26.10.2.2 If the test signal was produced by imperfections 
such as scratches, surface roughness, dings, straightener marks, 
loose ID bead and cutting chips, steel die stamps, stop marks, 
tube reducer ripple, or chattered flash trim, the tubing may be 
accepted or rejected depending on visual observation of the 
severity of the imperfection, the type of signal it produces on 
the testing equipment used, or both. 
26.10.2.3 If the test signal was produced by imperfections 
which cannot be identified, or was produced by cracks or 
crack-like imperfections, the tubing shall be rejected. 
26.10.3 Any tubes with imperfections of the types in 
26.10.2.2 and 26.10.2.3, exceeding 0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 
12½ % of the specified minimum wall thickness (whichever is 
greater) in depth shall be rejected. 
26.10.4 Rejected tubes may be reconditioned and retested 
providing the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that 
required by this or the product specification. If grinding is 
perfonned, the outside diameter in the area of grinding may be 
reduced by the amount so removed. To be accepted, recondi­
tioned tubes must pass the nondestructive examination by 
which they were originally rejected. 
27. Test Report 
27.1 The producer or supplier shall furnish a test report 
stating that the material was manufactured, sampled, tested and 
inspected in accordance with the specification, including year 
date, the supplementary requirements, and any other require­
ments designated in the purchase order or contract, and that the 
results met the requirements of that specification, the supple­
mentary requirements and the other requirements. A signature 
or notarization is not required on the test report, but the 
document shall be dated and shall clearly identify the organi­
zation submitting the report. Notwithstanding the absence of a 
signature or notarization, the organization submitting the report 
is responsible for the contents of the report. 
27 .2 In addition, the test report shall include the following 
information and test results, when applicable: 
27 .2.1 Heat Number, 
27 .2.2 Heat Analysis, 
27.2.3 Product Analysis, when specified, 
27.2.4 Tensile Properties, 
27.2.5 Width of the gage length, when longitudinal strip 
tension test specimens are used, 
27 .2.6 Flattening Test acceptable, 
27.2.7 Reverse Flattening Test acceptable, 
27.2.8 Flaring Test acceptable, 
27.2.9 Flange Test acceptable, 
27.2.10 Hardness Test values, 
27.2.11 Hydrostatic Test pressure, 
27.2.12 Non-destructive Electric Test method, 
27.2.13 Impact Test results, and 
27.2.14 Other test results or information required to be 
reported by the product specification. 
27 .3 Test results or information required to be reported by 
supplementary requirements, or other requirements designated 
in the purchase order or contract shall be reported, but may be 
reported in a separate document. 
27.4 The test report shall include a statement of explanation 
for the letter added to the specification number marked on the 
tubes (see 30.2), when all of the requirements of the specifi­
cation have not been completed. The purchaser must certify 
that all requirements of the specification have been completed 
before removal of the letter (that is, X, Y, or Z). 
27.5 A test report, certificate of compliance, or similar 
document printed from or used in electronic form from an 
electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission shall be re­
garded as having the same validity as a counterpart printed in 
the certifier's facility. The content of the EDI transmitted 
document shall meet the requirements of the invoked ASTM 
standard(s) and conform to any existing EDI agreement be­
tween the purchaser and supplier. Notwithstanding the absence 
of a signature, the organization submitting the EDI transmis­
sion is responsible for the content of the report. 
28. Inspection 
745 
28 .1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry at all times while work on the contract of the purchaser 
is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's works 
that concern the manufacture of the material ordered. The 
manufacturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities 
to satisfy him that the material is being furnished in accordance 
with this specification. All required tests and inspection shall 
be made at the place of manufacture prior to shipment, unless 
otherwise specified, and shall be conducted so as not to 
interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the works.

SA-450 /SA-450M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
29. Rejection 
29.1 Each length of tubing received from the manufacturer 
may be inspected by the purchaser and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of the specification based on the inspection and 
test method as outlined in the specification, the length may be 
rejected and the manufacturer shall be notified. Disposition of 
rejected tubing shall be a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
29.2 Material that fails in any of the forming operations or 
in the process of installation and is found to be defective shall 
be set aside and the manufacturer shall be notified for mutual 
evaluation of the material's suitability. Disposition of such 
material shall be a matter for agreement. 
30. Product Marking 
30. l Each length of tube shall be legibly stenciled with the 
manufacturers's name or brand, the specification number, and 
grade. The marking need not include the year date of the 
specification. For tubes less than 1 ¼ in. [31.8 mm] in diameter 
and tubes under 3 ft [1 m] in length, the required information 
may be marked on a tag securely attached to the bundle or box 
in which the tubes are shipped. 
30.2 When it is specified that certain requirements of a 
specification adopted by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Committee are to be completed by the purchaser upon receipt 
of the mate1ial, the manufacturer shall indicate that all require­
ments of the specification have not been completed by a letter 
such as X, Y, or Z, immediately following the specification 
number. This letter may be removed after completion of all 
requirements in accordance with the specification. An expla­
nation of specification requirements to be completed is pro­
vided in Section 27. 
30.3 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 30.1 
and 30.2, bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identifi­
cation method. The purchaser may specifiy in the order a 
specific bar coding system to be used. 
31. Packaging, Marking, and Loading 
31. l When specified on the purchase order, packaging, 
marking, and loading for shipment shall be in accordance with 
the procedures of Practices A700. 
32. Government Procurement 
32.1 Scale Free Pipe: 
32.1.1 When specified in the contract or order, the following 
requirements shall be considered in the inquiry contract or 
order, for agencies of the U.S. Government where scale free 
tube is required. These requirements shall take precedence if 
there is a conflict between these requirements and the product 
specification. 
32.1.2 Tube shall be ordered to outside diameter (OD) and 
wall thickness. 
32.1.3 Responsibility for Inspection-Unless otherwise 
specified in the contract or purchase order, the manufacturer is 
responsible for the performance of all inspection and test 
requirements specified. The absence of any inspection require­
ments in the specification shall not relieve the contractor of the 
responsibility for ensuring that all products or supplies submit­
ted to the Government for acceptance comply with all require­
ments of the contract. Sampling inspection, as part of the 
manufactming operations, is an acceptable practice to ascertain 
conformance to requirements, however, this does not authorize 
submission of known defective material, either indicated or 
actual, nor does it commit the Government to accept the 
material. Except as otherwise specified in the contract or 
purchase order, the manufacturer may use his own or any other 
suitable facilities for the perfonnance of the inspection and test 
requirements unless disapproved by the purchaser at the time 
the order is placed. The purchaser shall have the right to 
perform any of the inspections and tests set forth when such 
inspections and tests are deemed necessary to ensure that the 
material conforms to the prescribed requirements. 
746 
32.1.4 Sampling for Flattening and Flaring Test and for 
Visual and Dimensional Examination-Minimum sampling for 
flattening and flaring tests and visual and dimensional exami­
nation shall be as follows: 
Lot Size (pieces per Sample Size 
lot) 
2 to 8 Entire lot 
9 to 90 8 
91 to 150 12 
151 to 280 19 
281 to 500 21 
501 to 1200 27 
1201 to 3200 35 
3201 to 10 000 38 
10 001 to 35 000 46 
In all cases, the acceptance number is zero and the rejection 
number is one. Rejected lots may be screened and resubmitted 
for visual and dimensional examination. All defective items 
shall be replaced with acceptable items prior to lot acceptance 
32.1.5 Sampling for Chemical Analysis-One sample for 
chemical analysis shall be selected from each of two tubes 
chosen from each lot. A lot shall be all material poured from 
one heat. 
32.I.6 Sampling for Tension and Bend Test-One sample 
shall be taken from each lot. A lot shall consist of all tube of the 
same outside diameter and wall thickness manufactured during 
an 8-h shift from the same heat of steel, and heat treated under 
the same conditions of temperature and time in a single charge 
in a batch type furnace, or heat treated under the same 
condition in a continuous furnace, and presented for inspection 
at the same time. 
32.1.7 Hydrostatic and Ultrasonic Tests-Each tube shall be 
tested by the ultrasonic (when specified) and hydrostatic tests. 
32.1.8 Tube shall be free from heavy oxide or scale. The 
internal surface of hot finished ferritic steel tube shall be 
pickled or blast cleaned to a free of scale condition equivalent 
to the CSa2 visual standard listed in SSPC-SP6. Cleaning shall 
be performed in accordance with a written procedure that has 
been shown to be effective. This procedure shall be available 
for audit. 
32.1.9 In addition to the marking in Specification A530/ 
A530M, each length of tube ¼ in. outside diameter and larger 
shall be marked with the following listed information. Marking 
shall be in accordance with SAE-AMS2806 and MIL-STD-
792. (a) Outside diameter, wall thickness, and length (b) Heat 
or lot identification number.

(25) FOREWORD* 
In 1911, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers established the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee to for­
mulate standard rules for the construction of steam boilers and other pressure vessels. In 2009, the Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Committee was superseded by the following committees: 
(a) Committee on Power Boilers (I) 
(b J Committee on Materials (II) 
[c) Committee on Construction of Nuclear Facility Components (III) 
[ d) Committee on Heating Boilers (IV) 
(e) Committee on Nondestructive Examination (V) 
(fJ Committee on Pressure Vessels (VIII) 
(9) Committee on Welding, Brazing, and Fusing (IX) 
[h) Committee on Fiber-Reinforced Plastic Pressure Vessels (X) 
[i) Committee on Nuclear lnservice Inspection (XI) 
aJ Committee on Transport Tanks (XII) 
(k) Committee on Overpressure Protection (XIII) 
(I) Technical Oversight Management Committee (TOMC) 
Where reference is made to "the Committee" in this Foreword, each of these committees is included individually and 
collectively. 
The Committee's function is to establish rules of safety relating to pressure integrity. The rules govern the 
construction•• of boilers, pressure vessels, transport tanks, and nuclear components, and the inservice inspection of nu­
clear components and transport tanks. For nuclear items other than pressure-retaining components, the Committee also 
establishes rules of safety related to structural integrity. The Committee also interprets these rules when questions arise 
regarding their intent. The technical consistency of the Sections of the Code and coordination of standards development 
activities of the Committees is supported and guided by the Technical Oversight Management Committee. The Code does 
not address other safety issues relating to the construction of boilers, pressure vessels, transport tanks, or nuclear com­
ponents, or the inservice inspection of nuclear components or transport tanks. Users of the Code should refer to the 
pertinent codes, standards, laws, regulations, or other relevant documents for safety issues other than those relating 
to pressure integrity and, for nuclear items other than pressure-retaining components, structural integrity. Except for 
Sections XI and XII, and with a few other exceptions, the rules do not, of practical necessity, reflect the likelihood and 
consequences of deterioration in service related to specific service fluids or external operating environments. In formu­
lating the rules, the Committee considers the needs of users, manufacturers, and inspectors of components addressed by 
the Code. The objective of the rules is to afford reasonably certain protection of life and property, and to provide a mar­
gin for deterioration in service to give a reasonably long, safe period of usefulness. Advancements in design and materi­
als and evidence of experience have been recognized. 
The Code contains mandatory requirements, specific prohibitions, and nonmandatory guidance for construction ac­
tivities and inservice inspection and testing activities. The Code does not address all aspects of these activities and those 
aspects that are not specifically addressed should not be considered prohibited. The Code is not a handbook and cannot 
replace education, experience, and the use of engineering judgment. The phrase engineering judgment refers to technical 
judgments made by knowledgeable engineers experienced in the application of the Code. Engineering judgments must 
be consistent with Code philosophy, and such judgments must never be used to overrule mandatory requirements or 
specific prohibitions of the Code. 
The Committee recognizes that tools and techniques used for design and analysis change as technology progresses 
and expects engineers to use good judgment in the application of these tools. The designer is responsible for complying 
with Code rules and demonstrating compliance with Code equations when such equations are mandatory. The Code 
• The information contained in this Foreword is not part of this American National Standard (ANS) and has not been processed in accordance 
with ANSI's requirements for an ANS. Therefore, this Foreword may contain material that has not been subjected to public review or a con­
sensus process. In addition, it does not contain requirements necessary for conformance to the Code. 
" Construction, as used in this Foreword, is an all-inclusive term comprising materials, design, fabrication, examination, inspection, testing, 
certification, and overpressure protection.

neither requires nor prohibits the use of computers for the design or analysis of components constructed to the require­
ments of the Code. However, designers and engineers using computer programs for design or analysis are cautioned that 
they are responsible for all technical assumptions inherent in the programs they use and the application of these pro­
grams to their design. 
The rules established by the Committee are not to be interpreted as approving, recommending, or endorsing any pro­
prietary or specific design, or as limiting in any way the manufacturer's freedom to choose any method of design or any 
form of construction that conforms to the Code rules. 
The Committee meets regularly to consider revisions of the rules, new rules as dictated by technological development, 
Code cases, and requests for interpretations. Only the Committee has the authority to provide official interpretations of 
the Code. Requests for revisions, new rules, Code cases, or interpretations shall be addressed to the staff secretary in 
writing and shall give full particulars in order to receive consideration and action (see the Correspondence With the 
Committee page). Proposed revisions to the Code resulting from inquiries will be presented to the Committee for appro­
priate action. The action of the Committee becomes effective only after confirmation by ballot of the Committee and ap­
proval by ASME. Proposed revisions to the Code approved by the Committee are submitted to the American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) and published at http://go.asme.org/BPVCPublicReview to invite comments from all inter­
ested persons. After public review and final approval by ASME, revisions are published at regular intervals in Editions of 
the Code. 
The Committee does not rule on whether a component shall or shall not be constructed to the provisions of the Code. 
The scope of each Section has been established to identify the components and parameters considered by the Committee 
in formulating the Code rules. 
Questions or issues regarding compliance of a specific component with the Code rules are to be directed to the ASME 
Certificate Holder (Manufacturer). Inquiries concerning the interpretation of the Code are to be directed to the Commit­
tee. ASME is to be notified should questions arise concerning improper use of the ASME Single Certification Mark 
When required by context in the Code, the singular shall be interpreted as the plural, and vice versa. 
The words "shall;' "should," and "may" are used in the Code as follows: 
- Shall is used to denote a requirement. 
- Should is used to denote a recommendation. 
- May is used to denote permission, neither a requirement nor a recommendation.

STATEMENT OF POLICY ON THE USE OF THE ASME SINGLE 
CERTIFICATION MARK AND CODE AUTHORIZATION IN 
ADVERTISING 
ASME has established procedures to authorize qualified organizations to perform various activities in accordance 
with the requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. It is the aim of the Society to provide recognition 
of organizations so authorized. An organization holding authorization to perform various activities in accordance with 
the requirements of the Code may state this capability in its advertising literature. 
Organizations that are authorized to use the ASME Single Certification Mark for marking items or constructions that 
have been constructed and inspected in compliance with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code are issued Certifi­
cates of Authorization. It is the aim of the Society to maintain the standing of the ASME Single Certification Mark for the 
benefit of the users, the enforcement jurisdictions, and the holders of the ASME Single Certification Mark who comply 
with all requirements. 
Based on these objectives, the following policy has been established on the usage in advertising of facsimiles of the 
ASME Single Certification Mark, Certificates of Authorization, and reference to Code construction. The American Society 
of Mechanical Engineers does not "approve," "certify," "rate," or "endorse" any item, construction, or activity and there 
shall be no statements or implications that might so indicate. An organization holding the ASME Single Certification Mark 
and/or a Certificate of Authorization may state in advertising literature that items, constructions, or activities "are built 
(produced or performed) or activities conducted in accordance with the requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code," or "meet the requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code." An ASME corporate logo shall not 
be used by any organization other than ASME. 
The ASME Single Certification Mark shall be used only for stamping and nameplates as specifically provided in the 
Code. However, facsimiles may be used for the purpose of fostering the use of such construction. Such usage may be 
by an association or a society, or by a holder of the ASME Single Certification Mark who may also use the facsimile 
in advertising to show that clearly specified items will carry the ASME Single Certification Mark 
STATEMENT OF POLICY ON THE USE OF ASME MARKING TO 
IDENTIFY MANUFACTURED ITEMS 
The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code provides rules for the construction of boilers, pressure vessels, and nuclear 
components. This includes requirements for materials, design, fabrication, examination, inspection, and stamping. Items 
constructed in accordance with all of the applicable rules of the Code are identified with the ASME Single Certification 
Mark described in the governing Section of the Code. 
Markings such as ''ASME," ''ASME Standard," or any other marking including ''ASME" or the ASME Single Certification 
Mark shall not be used on any item that is not constructed in accordance with all of the applicable requirements of the 
Code. 
Items shall not be described on ASME Data Report Forms nor on similar forms referring to ASME that tend to imply 
that all Code requirements have been met when, in fact, they have not been. Data Report Forms covering items not fully 
complying with ASME requirements should not refer to ASME or they should clearly identify all exceptions to the ASME 
requirements.

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE COMMITTEE 
General 
ASME codes and standards are developed and maintained by committees with the intent to represent the consensus of 
concerned interests. Users of ASME codes and standards may correspond with the committees to propose revisions or 
cases, report errata, or request interpretations. Correspondence for this Section of the ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code (BPVC) should be sent to the staff secretary noted on the Section's committee web page, accessible at 
https://go.asme.org/CSCommittees. 
NOTE: See ASME BPVC Section II, Part D for guidelines on requesting approval of new materials. See Section II, Part C for guidelines on re- , ---
questing approval of new welding and brazing materials ("consumables"). 
Revisions and Errata 
The committee processes revisions to this Code on a continuous basis to incorporate changes that appear necessary or 
desirable as demonstrated by the experience gained from the application of the Code. Approved revisions will be pub­
lished in the next edition of the Code. 
In addition, the committee may post errata and Special Notices at http://go.asme.org/BPVCerrata. Errata and Special 
Notices become effective on the date posted. Users can register on the committee web page to receive email notifications 
of posted errata and Special Notices. 
This Code is always open for comment, and the committee welcomes proposals for revisions. Such proposals should 
be as specific as possible, citing the paragraph number, the proposed wording, and a detailed description of the reasons 
for the proposal, including any pertinent background information and supporting documentation. 
Cases 
(a) The most common applications for cases are 
(1) to permit early implementation of a revision based on an urgent need 
(2) to provide alternative requirements 
(3) to allow users to gain experience with alternative or potential additional requirements prior to incorporation 
directly into the Code 
(4) to permit use of a new material or process 
(b) Users are cautioned that not all jurisdictions or owners automatically accept cases. Cases are not to be considered 
as approving, recommending, certifying, or endorsing any proprietary or specific design, or as limiting in any way the 
freedom of manufacturers, constructors, or owners to choose any method of design or any form of construction that 
conforms to the Code. 
(c) The committee will consider proposed cases concerning the following topics only: 
(1) equipment to be marked with the ASME Single Certification Mark, or 
(2) equipment to be constructed as a repair/replacement activity under the requirements of Section XI 
(d) A proposed case shall be written as a question and reply in the same format as existing cases. The proposal shall 
also include the following information: 
(1) a statement of need and background information 
(2) the urgency of the case (e.g., the case concerns a project that is underway or imminent) 
(3) the Code Section and the paragraph, figure, or table number to which the proposed case applies 
(4) the editions of the Code to which the proposed case applies 
(e) A case is effective for use when the public review process has been completed and it is approved by the cognizant 
supervisory board. Cases that have been approved will appear in the next edition or supplement of the Code Cases 
books, "Boilers and Pressure Vessels" or "Nuclear Components." Each Code Cases book is updated with seven Supple­
ments. Supplements will be sent or made available automatically to the purchasers of the Code Cases books until the 
next edition of the Code. Annulments of Code Cases become effective six months after the first announcement of the 
annulment in a Code Case Supplement or Edition of the appropriate Code Case book The status of any case is available 
at http://go.asme.org/BPVCCDatabase. An index of the complete list of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Cases and Nu­
clear Code Cases is available at http://go.asme.org/BPVCC.

Interpretations 
(a) Interpretations clarify existing Code requirements and are written as a question and reply. Interpretations do not 
introduce new requirements. If a revision to resolve conflicting or incorrect wording is required to support the inter­
pretation, the committee will issue an intent interpretation in parallel with a revision to the Code. 
(b J Upon request, the committee will render an interpretation of any requirement of the Code. An interpretation can 
be rendered only in response to a request submitted through the online Inquiry Submittal Form at http:/ /go.asme.org/ 
InterpretationRequest. Upon submitting the form, the inquirer will receive an automatic email confirming receipt. 
(c) ASME does not act as a consultant for specific engineering problems or for the general application or understand­
ing of the Code requirements. If, based on the information submitted, it is the opinion of the committee that the inquirer 
should seek assistance, the request will be returned with the recommendation that such assistance be obtained. In­
quirers may track the status of their requests at http://go.asme.org/Interpretations. 
( d) ASME procedures provide for reconsideration of any interpretation when or if additional information that might 
affect an interpretation is available. Further, persons aggrieved by an interpretation may appeal to the cognizant ASME 
committee or subcommittee. ASME does not "approve," "certify," "rate," or "endorse" any item, construction, proprietary 
device, or activity. 
(e) Interpretations are published in the ASME Interpretations Database at http://go.asme.org/Interpretations as they 
are issued. 
Committee Meetings 
The ASME BPVC committees regularly hold meetings that are open to the public. Persons wishing to attend any meet­
ing should contact the secretary of the applicable committee. Information on future committee meetings can be found at

(25) PREFACE 
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) 
have cooperated for more than fifty years in the preparation of material specifications adequate for safety in the field 
of pressure equipment for ferrous and nonferrous materials, contained in Section II (Part A - Ferrous and Part B -
Nonferrous) of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
The evolution of this cooperative effort is contained in Professor A. M. Greene's "History of the ASME Boiler Code," 
which was published as a series of articles in Mechanical Engineering from July 1952 through August 1953 and is 
now available from ASME in a special bound edition. The following quotations from this history, which was based upon 
the minutes of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee, will help focus on the cooperative nature of the speci­
fications found in Section II, Material Specifications. 
"General discussion of material specifications comprising Paragraphs 1 to 112 of Part 2 and the advisability of having 
them agree with ASTM specifications," (1914). 
"ASME Subcommittee appointed to confer with ASTM," (1916). 
"Because of this cooperation the specifications of the 1918 Edition of the ASME Boiler Code were more nearly in agree­
ment with ASTM specifications. In the 1924 Edition of the Code, 10 specifications were in complete agreement with ASTM 
specifications, 4 in substantial agreement and 2 covered materials for which ASTM had no corresponding specifications." 
"In Section II, Material Specifications, the paragraphs were given new numbers beginning with S-1 and extending to 
S-213," {1925). 
"Section II was brought into agreement with changes made in the latest ASTM specifications since 1921," (1932). 
"The Subcommittee on Material Specifications arranged for the introduction of the revisions of many of the specifications 
so that they would agree with the latest form of the earlier ASTM specifications ... ," (1935). 
From the preceding, it is evident that many of the material specifications were prepared by the Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code Committees, then subsequently, by cooperative action, modified and identified as ASTM specifications. Sec­
tion II, Parts A and B, currently contain many material specifications that are identical with the corresponding ASTM 
specifications and some that have been modified for Code usage. Many of these specifications are published in dual for­
mat. That is, they contain both U.S. Customary units and SI units. The metrication protocols followed in the specifications 
are those adopted by ASTM, and are usually to the rules of IEEE/ ASTM SI 10-1997, Standard for the Use of the Inter­
national System of Units (SI): The Modern Metric System. 
In 1969, the American Welding Society began publication of specifications for welding rods, electrodes, and filler me­
tals, hitherto issued by ASTM. The Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee has recognized this new arrangement, and is 
now working with A WS on these specifications. Section II, Part C, contains the welding material specifications approved 
for Code use. 
In 1992, the ASME Board of Pressure Technology Codes and Standards endorsed the use of non-ASTM material for 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code applications. It is the intent to follow the procedures and practices currently in use 
to implement the adoption of non-ASTM materials. 
The specifications prepared and copyrighted by ASTM, AWS, and other originating organizations are reproduced in 
the Code with the permission of the respective Society. The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee has given care­
ful consideration to each new and revised specification, and has made such changes as they deemed necessary to make 
the specification adaptable for Code usage. In addition, ASME has furnished ASTM with the basic requirements that 
should govern many proposed new specifications. Joint action will continue an effort to make the ASTM, AWS, and ASME 
specifications identical. 
To assure that there will be a clear understanding on the part of the users of Section II, ASME publishes both the iden­
tical specifications and those amended for Code usage every 2 years. 
The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code has been adopted into law by 50 states and many municipalities in the 
United States and by all of the Canadian provinces.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
In this 2025 edition, the ''ASTM Personnel" page has been deleted from the front matter. In addition, specifications ori­
ginating with ASTM that are new or revised in this 2025 edition are formatted differently than those retained from the 
2023 and earlier editions. The document following the cover sheet of each new or revised specification is the unedited 
ASTM specification. The ASME title for the specification and any ASME-approved exceptions to the ASTM specification 
are shown only on the cover sheet. Specifications affected by the new format are listed in the Summary of Changes. 
Changes listed below are identified on the pages by a margin note, (25), placed next to the affected area.

6.2. l One tension test shall be made from each heat. The bar 
from which the test specimen is taken shall be heat-treated in 
the same manner as the castings represented. 
6.2.2 If a specimen is machined improperly or flaws are 
revealed by machining or during testing, the specimen may be 
discarded and another substituted from the same heat. 
6.3 Retests-If the results of the mechanical tests for any 
heat do not conform to the requirements specified, the castings 
may be reheat-treated and retested, but may not be solution­
treated more than twice. 
7. Hydrostatic Test 
7 .1 Each length of pipe shall be hydrostatically tested in 
accordance with Specification A999/ A999M.

5. Common Requirements 
5.1 Bolting materials and bolting components supplied to 
this specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci­
fication A962/ A962M. These requirements include test 
methods, finish, thread dimensions, marking, certification, 
optional supplementary requirements, and others. Failure to 
comply with the requirements of Specification A962/A9.62M 
constitutes nonconformance with this specification. In case of 
conflict between the requirements of this specification and 
Specification A962/ A962M, this specification shall prevail. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 Finishing Process: 
6.1.1 Threads may be formed by machining or rolling. 
Threads may be formed after precipitation heat treatment or 
after solution anneal but prior to precipitation heat treatment. 
Type designations are as follows: 
Type Ml-threads formed by machining after precipitation 
heat treatment. 
Type M2-threads formed by machining after solution 
anneal but prior to precipitation heat treatment. 
Type RI-threads formed by rolling after precipitation heat 
treatment. 
Type R2-threads formed by rolling after solution anneal 
but prior to precipitation heat treatment. 
When not specified by the purchaser, the type supplied shall 
be the option of the manufacturer. 
6.2 Heat Treatment-Each grade and class shall be heat 
treated as prescribed in Table 4. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 Each alloy shall conform to the chemical composition 
requirements prescribed in Table 3. 
8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 Tension Test: 
8.1.1 Requirements-Bolting material in each heat­
treatment charge shall conform to the room-temperature tensile 
requirements in Table 5. 
8.1.2 Number of Specimens: 
8.1.2.1 Heat-Treated Bars-When not more than two sizes 
of bars are heat treated in the same load, one tension test shall 
be made from each size in each heat of material in the 
heat-treatment charge (see 3.1.1). When more than two sizes of 
bars are treated in the same charge, one tension test shall be 
made from one bar of each of the two largest diameters from 
each heat of material in the heat-treating charge. 
8.1.2.2 Finished Bolting Components-One tension test 
shall be made if the lot consists of parts of the same nominal 
diameter. If the lot consists of components of more than one 
nominal diameter, one tension test shall be made from each 
nominal diameter of each heat involved in the lot (see Section 
3). 
8.2 Stress-Rupture Test: 
8.2.1 Requirements-Bolting material shall conform: to the 
stress-rupture requirements prescribed in Table 6 for design 
temperatures above 800 °F [427 °C]. Bolting material not 
stress-rupture tested shall be permanently stamped NR. Grade 
660 Class D and Grade 668 do not require stress-rupture and 
shall be stamped NR. 
8.2.2 The number of specimens shall be the same as the 
required number of tension test specimens. 
8.2.3 The test location and orientation shall be the same as 
that required for the tension test specimens. 
8.2.4 Test Method: 
8.2.4.1 The rupture test shall be performed in accordance 
with Practice El39. 
NOTE 1-Fig. 1 is taken from Test Method E292. This is to facilitate 
detection of notch sensitivity. The specimen found in Practice El39 does 
not include a notch. The specimen in Fig. 1 is to be used only to determine 
if the material is notch sensitive. Actual testing is to Practice E139, not 
Test Method E292, so the additional test data required by Test Method 
E292 is not to be determined or reported. 
8.2.4.2 A combination smooth and notched test specimen, 
machined to the dimensions prescribed in Fig. 1 and Table 7, 
shall be tested in accordance with the stress-rupture require­
ments prescribed in Table 6. The test shall be continued to 
rupture. The rupture shall occur in the smooth section of the 
bar. 
8.2.4.3 As an alternative procedure and, when specifically 
approved by the purchaser, separate smooth and notched test 
specimens, machined from adjacent sections of the same piece, 
with gage sections conforming to the respective dimensions of 
Table 7, may be tested under the above conditions. The notched 
specimen need not be tested to rupture but shall not rupture in 
less time than the companion smooth specimen. 
8.2.4.4 When the minimum specified time to rupture in 
Table 6 has been achieved, incremental loading may be used to 
accelerate the time to rupture. At intervals of 8 to 16 h, 
preferably 8 to 10 h, the stress shall be increased in increments 
of 5000 psi [34.5 MPa]. Rupture location, and elongation 
requirements shall be as prescribed in Table 6, 8.2.4.2, and 
8.2.4.3. 
8.3 Hardness Test: 
757 
8.3.1 Requirements-Bolting material shall conform to the 
room temperature hardness requirements prescribed in Table 5.

SA-455/SA-455M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Ve$sel Plates, Carbon Steel, High-Strength 
Manganese 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers high-tensile strength carbon­
manganese steel plates intended for welded pressure vessels. 
1.2 This steel is usually made to a semi-killed or capped 
deoxidation practice; however, at the purchaser's or the steel 
producer's option, the steel may be made silicon-killed or 
aluminum-killed. 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates furnished under this 
specification shall be¾ in. [20 mm]. 
1.4 For plates produced from coil and furnished without 
heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the additional 
requirements, including additional testing requirements and the 
reporting of additional test results, of Specification A20/ A20M 
apply. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
2. Referenced Documents 
2.1 ASTM Standards: 
A20/ A20M Specification for General Requirements for Steel 
Plates for Pressure Vessels 
3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out-
line tl1e testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. 
3.3 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates 
produced from coil means plates that have been cut to 
individual lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or 
is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of 
coils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, 
leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, 
heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for 
shipment, and certification. 
NoTE 1-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat 
treatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are reported for 
each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plates from coil 
are described in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Heat Treatment 
4.1 Plates are normally supplied in the as-rolled condition. 
The plates may be ordered normalized or stress relieved, or 
both. 
764
