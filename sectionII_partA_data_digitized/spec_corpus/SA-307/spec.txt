Carbon Steel Bolts and Studs, 60 000 PSI Tensile Strength 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers the chemical and mechanical 
requirements of three grades of carbon steel bolts and studs in 
sizes ¼ in. through 4 in. The fasteners are designated by 
"Grade" denoting tensile strength and intended use, as follows: 
Grade 
Grade A 
Description 
Bolts and studs having a 
minimum tensile strength of 
60 ksi and intended for 
general applications, 
Grade B Bolts and studs having a 
tensile strength of 60 to 100 
ksi and intended for flanged 
joints in piping systems with 
cast iron flanges, and 
Grade C Replaced by Specification 
F1554 Gr.36 
1.1.1 The term studs includes stud stock, sometimes re­
ferred to as threaded rod. 
1.2 This specification does not cover requirements for 
machine screws, thread cutting/forming screws, mechanical 
expansion anchors or similar externally threaded fasteners.

A, heavy hex 
A Nuts of other grades and styles having specified proof load stresses (Speci­
fication A563, Table 3) greater than the specified grade and style of nut are also 
suitable. 
1.4 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as the standard. 
1.5 Supplementary Requirement S 1 of an optional nature is 
provided, which describes additional restrictions to be applied 
when bolts are to be welded. It shall apply only when specified 
in the inquiry, order, and contract.

1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers two classes, nine grades, 
and four conditions of stress-relieved cold-drawn carbon 
steel bars produced to mechanical property requirements. 
One class, B, is cold drawn with higher than normal (heavy) 
drafts to provide higher strength levels, and four grades 
provide improved machinability. 
1.2 Supplementary Requirements, S 1 through S6, of 
an optional nature are provided. 
1.3 The values stated in inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded as the standard. Within the text, the SI 
units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents, therefore, each system 
must be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in nonconformance with 
the specification.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions: 
3.1.1 stress relieving - heating to a suitable tempera­
ture, holding long enough to reduce residual stresses, and 
446 
then cooling slowly enough to minimize the development 
of new residual stresses. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.1 heavy draft- Using higher than normal drafts 
(approximately 10% through 35% reduction), followed by 
stress relieving, produces higher tensile and yield strengths 
provided an appropriate composition is used; for example, 
medium carbon with nonnal or higher manganese content.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified 
by the purchaser in the inquiry or order. Details of these requirements shall be agreed upon 
between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
Sl. Special Surface 
Sl.1 When inspection standards more restrictive than 
visual inspection are required, special surface may be spec­
ified. 
S2. Restricted Cast or Heat Analysis 
S2.1 When required, the purchaser may specify restric­
tive cast or heat analysis limits on one or more elements. 
The degree of restriction and the number of elements so 
restricted are both subject to agreement between the manu­
facturer and the purchaser. 
S3. Restricted Decarburization 
S3.1 The purchaser may specify a maximum affected 
depth of decarburization when required for special applica­
tions, subject to agreement between the manufacturer and 
the purchaser. 
S4. Nonmetallic Inclusion Requirements 
(Microscopical) 
S4.1 When nonmetallic inclusion requirements are 
specified, the samples for testing shall be taken on a longitu­
dinal direction midway between the center and the surface 
of the material. The area of the sample to be examined 
450 
should be agreed upon between the purchaser and the man­
ufacturer, and the test specimen should be hardened by 
heating and quenched before being polished to avoid pits. 
The rating of the inclusion count should also be agreed 
upon and be based upon examination at a magnification 
of 100 diameters. Resulfurized steels are not subject to 
inclusion ratings. 
S5. Restricted Incidental Elements 
S5.1 The purchaser may specify limiting maximum 
requirements for copper, nickel, chromium, or molybde­
num subject to agreement between the manufacturer and 
the purchaser. 
S6. Grain Size 
S6.1 The steel shall conform to either the coarse austen­
itic grain size (except as stated in S6.2), or the fine austen­
itic grain size requirement of Specification A 29 / A 29M. 
S6.2 Certain elements, or combinations of elements, 
such as manganese, sulfur, and lead tend to produce grain 
refinement and it is technically inappropriate to ensure 
coarse grain size as measured by the McQuaid-Ehn test 
on high manganese, high sulfur, and leaded steels such as 
1144, 1151, and 11L41.

INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless, Welded, and Heavily Cold Worked Austenitic 
Stainless Steel Pipes 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A312/ A312M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers seamless, straight-seam 
welded, and heavily cold worked welded austenitic stainless 
steel pipe intended for high-temperature and general corrosive 
service. 
1.2 Grades TP304H, TP309H, TP309HCb, TP310H, 
TP310HCb, TP316H, TP321H, TP347H, and TP348H are 
modifications of Grades TP304, TP309Cb, TP309S, TP310Cb, 
TP310S, TP316, TP321, TP347, and TP348, and are intended 
for service at temperatures where creep and stress rupture 
properties are important. 
1.3 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for 
pipe where a greater degree of testing is desired. These 
supplementary requirements call for additional tests to be made 
and, when desired, it is permitted to specify in the order one or 
more of these supplementary requirements. 
1.4 Table Xl.l lists the standardized dimensions of welded 
and seamless stainless steel pipe as shown in ASME B36.19. 
These dimensions are also applicable to heavily cold worked 
pipe. Pipe having other dimensions is permitted to be ordered 
and furnished provided such pipe complies with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.5 Grades TP321 and TP321H have lower strength require­
ments for pipe manufactured by the seamless process in 
nominal wall thicknesses greater than 3/s in. [9.5 mm]. 
1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-confonnance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order.

passing Practices A262, Practice E. The manufacturer is not required to run the 
test unless it is specified on the purchase order (see Supplementary Requirement 
S7). Note that Practices A262 requires the test to be performed on sensitized 
specimens in the low-carbon and stabilized types and on specimens representa­
tive of the as-shipped condition for other types. In the case of low-carbon types 
containing 3 % or more molybdenum, the applicability of the sensitizing treatment

11.2 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One tension 
test shall be made on a specimen for lots of not more than 100 
pipes. Tension tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes 
for lots of more than 100 pipes. 
11.3 Flattening Test-For material heat treated in a continu­
ous furnace, by quenching after hot forming or in a batch-type 
furnace equipped with recording pyrometers and automatically 
controlled within a 50 °F [30 °C] or lesser range, flattening 
tests shall be made on a sufficient number of pipe to constitute 
5 % of the lot, but in no case less than 2 lengths of pipe. For 
material heat treated in a batch-type furnace not equipped with 
recording pyrometers and automatically controlled within a 50 
°F [30 °C] or lesser range, flattening tests shall be made on 5 % 
of the pipe from each heat treated lot. 
11.3.1 For welded pipe a transverse-guided face bend test of 
the weld may be conducted instead of a flattening test in 
accordance with the method outlined in the steel tubular 
product supplement of Test Methods and Definitions A370. For 
welded pipe with a specified wall thickness over 3/s in., two 
side bend tests may be made instead of the face bend test. The 
ductility of the weld shall be considered acceptable when there 
is no evidence of cracks in the weld or between the weld and 
the base metal after bending. Test specimens from 5 % of the 
lot shall be taken from the pipe or test plates of the same 
material as the pipe, the test plates being attached to the end of 
the cylinder and welded as a prolongation of the pipe longitu­
dinal seam. 
11.4 Grain Size-Grain size determinations, in accordance 
with Test Methods E112, shall be made on the grades listed in 
Table 5. Grain size determinations shall be made on each heat 
treatment lot, as defined in 11.1, for the same number of pipes 
as prescribed for the flattening test in 11.3. The grain size 
results shall conform to the requirements prescribed in Table 5.

shall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order. 
12.2 The hydrostatic test shall be in accordance with Speci­
fication A999/A999M, unless specifically exempted under the 
provisions of 12.3. 
12.3 For pipe whose dimensions equal or exceed NPSlO, 
the purchaser, with the agreement of the manufacturer, is 
permitted to waive the hydrostatic test requirement when in 
lieu of such test the purchaser performs a system test. Each 
length of pipe furnished without the completed manufacturer's 
hydrostatic test shall include with the mandatory markings the 
letters "NH." 
12.4 The nondestructive electric test shall be in accordance 
with Specification A999/A999M. 
13. Lengths 
13.1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following 
regular practice: 
13.1.1 Unless otherwise agreed upon, all sizes from NPS 
1/s to and including NPS 8 are available in a length up to 24 ft 
with the permitted range of 15 to 24 ft. Short lengths are 
acceptable and the number and minimum length shall be 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
13.1.2 If definite cut lengths ate desired, the lengths re­
quired shall be specified in the order. No pipe shall be under the 
specified length and no pipe shall be more than ¼ in. [6 mm] 
over the specified length. 
13.1.3 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise specified. 
14. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
14.1 The finished pipes shall be reasonably straight and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. Removal of imperfections by 
grinding is permitted, provided the wall thicknesses are not 
decreased to less than that permitted in the Permissible 
Variations in Wall Thickness section of Specification A999/ 
A999M. 
15. Repair by Welding 
15.1 For welded pipe whose diameter equals or exceeds 
NPS 6, and whose nominal wall thickness equals or exceeds 
0.200, it is permitted to make weld repairs to the weld seam 
with the addition of compatible filler metal using the same 
procedures specified for plate defects in the section on Repair 
by Welding of Specification A999/ A999M. 
15.2 Weld repairs of the weld seam shall not exceed 20 % of 
the seam length. 
15.3 Weld repairs shall be made only with the gas tungsten­
arc welding process using the same classification of bare filler 
rod qualified to the most currentAWS SpecificationA5.9 as the 
grade of stainless steel pipe being repaired and as shown in 
Table 6. Alternatively, subject to approval by the purchaser, 
weld repairs shall be made only with the gas tungsten-arc 
welding process using a filler metal more highly alloyed than 
the base metal when needed for corrosion resistance or other 
properties. 
15 .4 Pipes that have had weld seam repairs with filler metal 
shall be uniquely identified and shall be so stated and identified

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the 
purchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided 
in the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, 
retest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. 
Sl. Product Analysis 
S 1.1 For all pipe NPS 5 and larger in nominal size there shall 
be one product analysis made of a representative sample from 
one piece for each ten lengths or fraction thereof from each 
heat of steel. 
S 1.2 For pipe smaller than NPS 5 there shall be one product 
analysis made from ten lengths per heat of steel or from 10 % 
of the number of lengths per heat of steel, whichever number 
is smaller. 
Sl.3 Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical 
requirements specified in Section 7 shall be rejected. 
S2. Transverse Tension Tests 
S2. l There shall be one transverse tension test made from 
one end of 10 % of the lengths furnished per heat of steel. This 
requirement is applicable only to pipe NPS 8 and larger. 
461 
S2.2 If a specimen from any length fails to conform to the 
tensile properties specified that length shall be rejected. 
S3. Flattening Test 
S3.l The flattening test of Specification A999/A999M shall 
be made on a specimen from one end or both ends of each pipe. 
Crop ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is 
specified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. 
If a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility 
prior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening 
test requirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat­
ment in accordance with Specification A999/A999M and 
satisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails 
because of a lack of soundness that length shall be rejected, 
unless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length 
is sound.

S4. Etching Tests 
S4.1 The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching 
tests conducted in accordance with the appropriate portions of 
Method E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section 
from one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound 
and reasonably uniform material free of injurious laminations, 
cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this supplementary 
requirement is specified, the number of tests per pipe required 
shall also be specified. If a specimen from any length shows 
objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, subject to 
removal of the defective end and subsequent retests indicating 
the remainder of the length to be sound and reasonably uniform 
material. 
S5. Radiographic Examination 
S5.l The entire length of weld in each double welded pipe 
shall be radiographically examined, using X-radiation, in 
accordance with Paragraph UW-51 of Section VIII Division 1 
of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. In addition to 
the marking required by Section 13 each pipe shall be marked 
"RT" after the specification and grade. Requirements of S5 
shall be required in the certification. 
S6. Stabilizing Heat Treatment 
S6.1 Subsequent to the solution anneal required in 6.2, 
Grades TP309HCb, TP310HCb, TP321, TP321H, TP347, 
TP347H, TP348, and TP348H shall be given a stabilization 
heat treatment at a temperature lower than that used for the 
initial solution annealing heat treatment. The temperature of 
stabilization heat treatment shall be as agreed upon between the 
purchaser and vendor. 
S7. Intergranular Corrosion Test 
S7.l When specified, material shall pass intergranular cor­
rosion tests conducted by the manufacturer in accordance with 
Practices A262, Practice E. 
S7 .1.1 Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condi­
tion for low carbon or stabilized grades, and on the as-shipped 
condition for other grades. The applicability of this test and the 
preparation of the sample for testing for grades containing 
greater than 3 % molybdenum shall be as agreed by the 
purchaser and manufacturer. 
Norn S7.1-Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condition for 
low carbon or stabilized grades, and on the as-shipped condition for other 
grades. 
S7.2 A stabilization heat treatment in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement S6 may be necessary and is 
permitted in order to meet this requirement for the grades 
containing titanium or columbium, particularly in their H 
versions. 
S8. Minimum Wall Pipe 
S8.1 When specified by the purchaser, pipe shall be fur­
nished on a minimum wall basis. The wall of such pipe shall 
not fall below the thickness specified. In addition to the 
marking required by Section 17, the pipe shall be marked S8. 
S9. Weld Decay Test 
S9 .1 When specified in the purchase order, one sample from 
each lot of pipe shall be subject to testing in a boiling solution 
of 50 % reagent grade hydrochloric acid and 50 % water. 
S9.2 The sample, of approximately 2-in. [50-mm] length, 
shall be prepared from a production length of pipe. Depending 
on the size of the pipe, it is permitted to section the sample 
longitudinally to allow it to fit in the Erlenmeyer flask. As a 
minimum, the tested sample shall include the entire weld and 
adjacent area and the full length of base metal 180° across from 
the weld. All burrs and sharp edges shall be removed by light 
grinding. Dust and grease shall be removed by cleaning with 
soap and water or other suitable solvents. 
S9.3 The hydrochloric acid solution shall be prepared by 
slowly adding reagent grade (approximately 37 %) hydrochlo­
ric acid to an equal volume of distilled water. 
Warning-Protect eyes and use rubber gloves when han­
dling acid. Mixing and testing shall be performed in a 
protective enclosure. 
S9.4 The test container shall be a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask 
equipped with ground-glass joints and an Ahline condenser. 
The volume of the solution shall be approximately 700 mL. 
S9.5 The thickness of the weld and the base metal 180° 
from the weld shall be measured near both ends of the sample. 
These measurements shall be made with a micrometer with an 
anvil shape suitable for measuring the thickness with an 
accuracy to at least 0.001 in. [0.025 mm]. 
S9.6 The sample sections, both weld and base metal, shall 
be immersed in the flask containing the solution. Boiling chips 
shall be added and the solution brought to a boil. Boiling shall 
be maintained through the duration of the test. The time of 
testing shall be that which is required to remove 40 to 60 % of 
the original base metal thickness (usually 2 h or less). If more 
than 60 % of the base metal thickness remains, it is permitted 
to terminate the test after 24 h. 
462 
S9.7 At the end of the test period, the samples shall be 
removed from the solution, rinsed with distilled water, and 
dried. 
S9.8 The thickness measurements as in S9.5 shall be re­
peated. The anvil shape of the micrometer used shall be 
suitable for measuring the minimum remaining thickness with 
an accuracy to at least 0.001 in. [0.025 mm]. 
S9.9 The corrosion ratio, R, shall be calculated as follows: 
W)l(B 0 - B) 
where: 
W 0 = average weld-metal thickness before the test, 
W = average weld-metal thickness after the test, 
B 0 = average base-metal thickness before the test, and 
B = average base-metal thickness after the test, 
S9.9.1 The corrosion ratio for HCW pipe shall be as 
specified in 11.5. 
S9.9.2 The corrosion ratio shall be 1.25 or less, or as further 
restricted in the purchase order, when the weld decay test is 
specified for welded (WLD) pipe.

shall consist of holding the bolting material for a sufficient time 
at a temperature at which the chromium carbide will go into 
solution and then cooling in air or in a liquid medium at a rate 
sufficient to prevent reprecipitation of the carbide. Bolting 
material thus treated is described as Class 1. If specified in the 
purchase order, bolting material shall be solution treated in the 
finished condition and shall be described as Class lA. 
468 
5.1.2 Use of water quenching is prohibited for any ferritic 
grade when heat treatment is performed after heading or 
threading. 
5.1.3 When increased mechanical properties are desired, 
austenitic bolting shall be solution annealed and strain hard­
ened if specified in the purchase order; material so treated is 
identified as Class 2. 
5 .1.4 If scale-free bright finish is required, this shall be 
specified in the purchase order. 
5.1.5 For L7M bolting, the final heat treatment, which may 
be the tempering or stress-relieving operation conducted at 
1150 °F [620 °C] minimum, shall be done after machining or 
rolling of the threads and any type of cutting. 
6. Mechanical Requirements 
6.1 Tensile Properties: 
6.1.1 Bolting material as represented by the tension speci­
mens shall conform to the requirements as to tensile properties 
prescribed in Table 1 at room temperature after heat treatment 
(see 5.1.1). Alternatively, Class 2 Strain Hardened Headed 
Bolting Components shall be tested full size after strain 
hardening to determine tensile strength and yield strength and 
shall conform to the requirements prescribed in Table 1. 
Should the results of full size tests conflict with results of 
tension specimen tests, full size test results shall prevail. 
6.1.2 Number of Tests: 
6.1.2.1 For heat-treated bars, one tension test and one 
impact test consisting of three specimens shall be made for 
each diameter of each heat represented in each tempering 
charge. When heat treated without interruption in continuous 
furnaces, the material in a lot shall be the same heat, same prior 
condition, same size, and subjected to the same heat treatment. 
Not fewer than two tensile tests and two impact tests are 
required for each lot containing 20 000 lbs [9000 kg] or less. 
Every additional 10 000 lbs [4500 kg] or fraction thereof 
requires an additional tensile test and impact test.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-320/SA-320M 
6.1.2.2 For studs, bolts, screws, etc., one tension test and 
one set of three impact specimens shall be made for each 
diameter of each heat involved in the lot. Each lot shall consist 
of the following: 
Diameter, in. (mm] Lot Size, lb [kg] 
11/s [30] and under 1500 (680] or fraction thereof 
Over 11/s (30] to 1 ¾ [ 45], 4500 (2040] or fraction 
incl thereof 
Over 1¾ (45] to 2½ (65], 6000 [2700] or fraction 
incl thereof 
Over 2½ (65] 100 pieces or fraction thereof 
6.1.2.3 Full Size Specimens, Headed Bolting Components­
Headed bolts or screws 1 ½ in. in body diameter and smaller, 
with body length three times the diameter or longer, and that 
are produced by upsetting or forging (hot or cold) shall be 
subjected to full size testing in accordance with 6.1.3. This 
testing shall be in addition to tensile testing as specified in 
6.1.1. Wedge tensile testing shall be limited to product with 
socket head cap screw, hexagon, square, hex flange, or twelve 
point flange heads. The lot size shall be shown in 6.1.2.2. 
Failure shall occur in the body or threaded section with no 
failure, or indications of failure, such as cracks, at the junction 
of the head and shank. Wedge tensile testing is not required for 
flat countersunk head or socket button products. 
6.1.3 Full Size Bolting Components, Wedge Tensile 
Testing-When applicable, see 6.1.2.3. Headed components 
shall be wedge tested full size. The minimum full size load 
applied (lbf or kN) for individual sizes shall be as follows: 
W= T., XA, (1) 
where: 
w 
Ts 
A1 
=

= 
minimum wedge tensile load without fracture, 
tensile strength specified in ksi or MPa in Tables 2 and 
3, and 
stress area of the thread section, square inches or square 
millimetres, as shown in the Cone Proof Load Tables in 
Specification A962/A962M. 
6.2 Impact Properties: 
6.2.1 Requirements: 
6.2.1.1 Impact tests are required for the grades shown in 
Table 3. Class 1, lA, and 2 austenitic steels for temperatures 
above -325 °F [-200 °C]; Class 1 and IA austenitic Grades BS, 
BSA, BSP, BSPA, BSC, BSCA, BSLN, and BSLNA above 
-425 °F [-255 °C]; and ferritic or austenitic bolting½ in. [12.5 
mm] and smaller, are exempt from impact testing, unless 
Supplementary Requirement Sl is specified in the purchase 
order (see 1.4). All other material furnished under this speci­
fication shall be tested. Material of Grades L 7, L 7 A, L 7B, L 7C, 
L7M, L43, L70, L71, L72, and L73 shall show a minimum 
impact energy absorption of 20 ft • lbf [27 J] and of Grade LI 
a minimum impact energy absorption of 40 ft - lbf [54 J] at the 
specified test temperature. 
6.2.1.2 The temperature of the coolant used for chilling the 
test specimens shall be controlled within ±2 °F [l 0 C]. Test 
temperatures for ferritic grades are listed in Table 2. Excep­
tions to this requirement are permissible, and the impact tests 
may be made at specified temperatures different than those 
shown in Table 2, provided the test temperature is at least as 
low as the intended service temperature and the bolting is 
suitably marked to identify the reported test temperature. When 
impact testing is required for austenitic grades, test criteria 
shall be agreed upon between the supplier and purchaser. 
6.2.1.3 The impact test requirements for standard and sub­
size Charpy V-notch (CVN) test specimens are prescribed in 
Table 2. If the material is impact tested at a temperature lower 
than the specified test temperature with impact energy absorp­
tion results equal to or greater than the specified required 
impact energy absorption for that product, the material can be 
considered suitable for the specified test temperature. 
NoTE 2-As an example, the purchase order or contract requires an 
L-g:rade bolt to have an average 15 ft-lbs at -50 °F. If the Charpy V-notch 
testing indicates that the bolting material passes at -100 °F and if it also 
meets other mechanical property or other environmental resistance 
requirements, it is permissible or suitable for use if that specified 
temperature reflects the rninimum anticipated temperature range to which 
that the product or application will be subjected. 
6.2.2 Number of Tests: 
6.2.2.1 The test requirements for heat-treated bars are given 
in 6.1.2.1. 
6.2.2.2 For test requirements on studs, bolts, screws, etc., 
see 6.1.2.2. 
6.2.2.3 Impact tests are not required to be made on heat­
treated bars, bolts, screws, studs, and stud bolts ½ in. [12.5 
mm] and under in diameter. 
469 
6.2.3 Test Specimens-For sections 1 in. [25 mm] or less in 
diameter, test specimens shall be taken at the axis; for sections 
over 1 in. [25 mm] in diameter, midway between the axis and 
the surface. 
6.3 Hardness Requirements: 
6.3.1 The hardness shall conform to the requirements pre­
scribed in Table 1. Hardness testing shall be performed in 
accordance with either Specification A962/A962M or with Test 
Methods F606/F606M. 
6.3.2 The maximum hardness of Grade L7M shall be 235 
HBW or 99 HRB. Minimum hardness shall not be less than 200 
HBW or 93 HRB. Conformance to this hardness shall be 
ensured by testing each bolt or stud by Brinell or Rockwell B 
methods in accordance with 6.3.1. 
6.3.2.1 The use of 100 % electromagnetic testing for hard­
ness as an alternative to 100 % indentation hardness testing is 
permissible when qualified by sampling using indentation 
hardness testing. Each lot tested for hardness electromagneti­
cally shall be 100 % examined in accordance with Practice 
E566. Following electromagnetic testing for hardness, a ran­
dom sample of a minimum of 100 pieces in each purchase lot 
(as defined in 6.1.2.2) shall be tested by indentation hardness 
methods. All samples must meet hardness requirements to 
permit acceptance of the lot. If any one sample is outside of the 
specified maximum or minimum hardness, the lot shall be 
rejected and either reprocessed and resampled, or tested 100 % 
by indentation hardness methods. 
6.3.2.2 In the event a controversy exists relative to mini­
mum strength, tension tests shall prevail over hardness read­
ings. Products which have been tested and found acceptable 
shall have a line under the grade symbol.

APPENDIX 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. STRAIN HARDENING OF AUSTENITIC STEELS 
Xl.1 Strain hardening is the increase in strength and hard­
ness that results from plastic deformation below the recrystal­
lization temperature (cold work). This effect is produced in 
austenitic stainless steels by reducing oversized bars or wire to 
the desired final size by cold drawing or other process. The 
degree of strain hardening achievable in any alloy is limited by 
its strain hardening characteristics. In addition, the amount of 
strain hardening that can be produced is further limited by the 
variables of the process, such as the total amount of cross­
section reduction, die angle, and bar size. In large diameter 
bars, for example, plastic deformation will occur principally in 
the outer regions of the bar, so that the increased strength and 
hardness due to strain hardening is achieved predominantly 
near the surface of the bar. That is, the smaller the bar, the 
472 
greater the penetration of strain hardening. 
Xl.2 Thus, the mechanical properties of a given strain 
hardened bolting components, such as a bolt, screw, or stud, are 
dependent not just on the alloy, but also on the size of bar from 
which it is machined. The minimum bar size that can be used, 
however, is established by the configuration of the component, 
so that the configuration can affect the strength of the compo­
nent. 
Xl.3 For example, a stud of a particular alloy and size may

4.2 Grade 11 pipe may be produced by welding with or 
without the addition of filler metal. The following requirements 
shall apply for Grade 11 welded with the addition of filler 
metal. 
4.2. l The joints shall be full-penetration, full fusion double­
welded or single-welded butt joints employing fusion welding 
processes as defined in "Definitions," ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX. This specification makes no 
provision for any difference in weld quality requirements 
regardless of the weld joint type employed (single or double) in 
making the weld. Where backing strips are employed, the ring 
or strip material shall be the same as the plate being joined. 
Backing rings or strips shall be completely removed after 
welding, prior to any required radiography, and the exposed 
weld surface shall be examined visually for conformance to the 
requirements of 4.2.2. Welds made by procedures employing 
backing strips or rings which remain in place are prohibited. 
Welding procedures and welding operators shall be qualified in 
accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
Section IX. 
4.2.2 The weld surface on either side of the weld may be 
flush with the base plate or may have a reasonably uniform 
crown, not to exceed 1/s in. [3 mm]. Any weld reinforcement 
may be removed at the manufacturer's option or by agreement 
between the manufacturer and purchaser. The contour of the 
reinforcement shall be reasonably smooth and free from 
in-egularities. The deposited metal shall be fused uniformly 
into the plate surface. No concavity of contour is permitted 
unless the resulting thickness of weld metal is equal to or 
greater than the minimum thickness of the adjacent base metal. 
4.2.3 Radiographic Examination-All welded joints shall 
be fully radiographed in accordance with the requirements of 
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, 
Division 1, latest edition, paragraph UW-51. 
4.2.3.1 As an alternative, the welded joints may be ultra­
sonically examined in accordance with Appendix 12 of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 
l. 
4.2.4 Repair Welding-Weld metal defects shall be repaired 
by removal to sound metal and repair welding if approved by 
the purchaser. 
4.2.4. l The repair shall be blended smoothly into the 
surrounding base metal surface and examined by the magnetic 
particle examination in accordance with Practice E709, or by 
the liquid penetrant method in accordance with Practice E165. 
4.2.4.2 Each repair weld of a cavity where the cavity, before 
repair welding, has a depth exceeding the lesser of 1/s in. [9.5 
mm] or 10.5 % of the nominal thickness shall be radiographi­
cally examined as required for the original welds. 
4.2.5 Transverse Tension Test-One test shall be made to 
represent each lot (Note 3) of finished pipe. The test specimens 
shall be taken across the welded joint. The tension test results 
of the welded joints shall conform to the tensile properties for 
Grade 11 in Table 2. 
485 
4.2.5 .1 The test specimens shall be taken from the end of the 
finished pipe. As an alternative, the tension test specimens may 
be taken from a welded prolongation of the same material as 
the pipe, which is attached to the end of the pipe and welded as 
a ·prolongation of the pipe longitudinal seam. 
4.2.5.2 The test specimens shall be in accordance with 
Section IX, Part QW, paragraph QW-150 of the ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code and shall be one of the types shown 
in QW-462.l of that code. The tension test specimen may be 
flattened cold before final machining to size. 
4.2.6 Transverse Guided-Bend Weld Test-One transverse 
guided bend test (two specimens) shall be made to represent 
each lot (Note 3) of finished pipe. 
4.2.6.1 The two bend test specimens shall be taken from the 
weld at the end of the finished pipe. As an alternative, by 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, the test 
specimens may be taken from a test plate of the san1e material

5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
5.2 When Grades 1, 6, or 10 are ordered under this 
specification, supplying an alloy grade that specifically re­
quires the addition of any element other than those listed for 
the ordered grade in Table l is not permitted. However, the 
addition of elements required for the deoxidation of the steel is 
permitted. 
6. Product Analysis 
6.1 At the request of the purchaser, an analysis of one billet 
or two samples of flat-rolled stock from each heat or of two 
pipes from each lot shall be made by the manufacturer. A lot of 
pipe shall consist of the following: 
NPS Designator 
Under 2 
2 to 6 
Over 6 
Length of Pipe in Lot 
400 or fraction thereof 
200 or fraction thereof 
100 or fraction thereof 
6.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the 
purchaser or the purchaser's representative and shall conform 
to the requirements specified. 
6.3 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 6.1 does 
not conform to the requirements specified, an analysis of each 
billet or pipe from the same heat or lot may be made, and aH 
billets or pipe conforming to the requirements shall be ac­
cepted. 
7. Tensile Requirements 
7 .1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. 
8. Impact Requirements 
8.1 For Grades 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11, the notched-bar 
impact properties of each set of three impact specimens, 
including specimens for the welded joint in welded pipe with 
wall thicknesses of 0.120 in. [3 mm] and larger, when tested at 
temperatures in conformance with 14.1 shall be not less than 
the values prescribed in Table 3. 
8.1.1 If the impact value of one specimen is below the 
minimum value, or the impact values of two specimens are less 
than the minimum average value but not below the minimum 
value permitted on a single specimen, a retest shall be allowed. 
The retest shall consist of breaking three additional specimens 
and each specimen must equal or exceed the required average 
value. When an erratic result is caused by a defective 
specimen, or there is uncertainty in test procedures, a retest will 
be allowed. 
8.2 For Grade 8 each of the notched bar impact specimens 
shall display a lateral expansion opposite the notch of not less 
than 0.015 in. [0.38 mm]. 
8.2.1 When the average lateral expansion value for the three 
impact specimens equals or exceeds 0.015 in. [0.38 mm] and 
the value for one specimen is below 0.015 in. [0.38 mm] but 
not below 0.010 in. [0.25 mm], a retest of three additional 
specimens may be made. The lateral expansion of each of the 
retest specimens must equal or exceed 0.015 in. [0.38 mm]. 
8.2.2 Lateral expansion values shall be determined by the 
procedure in Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
8.2.3 The values of absorbed energy in foot-pounds and the 
fracture appearance in percentage shear shall be recorded for 
information. A record of these values shall be retained for a 
period of at least 2 years. 
9. Lengths 
9 .1 If definite lengths are not required, pipe may be ordered 
either in single random lengths of 16 to 22 ft (Note 4) with 
maximum 5 % of the lengths between 12 and 16 ft (Note 4), or 
in double random lengths with a minimum average of 35 ft 
(Note 4) and an absolute minimum length of22 ft (Note 4) with 
maximum 5 % of the lengths between 16 and 22 ft (Note 4). 
NoTE 4-This value(s) applies when the inch-pound designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase. When the "M" designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase, the corresponding metric value(s) 
shaU be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
10.l The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient num­
ber of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable 
assurance that they have been properly evaluated with respect 
to depth. Exploration of all surface imperfections is not 
required but may be necessary to ensure compliance with 10.2. 
10.2 Smface imperfections that penetrate more than 12½ % 
of the nominal wall thickness or encroach on the minimum 
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with such 
defects shall be given one of the following dispositions: 
10.2.1 The defect may be removed by grinding provided 
that the remaining wall thickness is within specified limits. 
10.2.2 Repaired in accordance with the repair welding 
provisions of 10.5. 
488 
10.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect may be cut 
off within the limits of requirements on length. 
10.2.4 The defective pipe may be rejected. 
10.3 To provide a workmanlike finish and basis for evalu­
ating conformance with 10.2, the pipe manufacturer shall 
remove by grinding the following: 
10.3.1 Mechanical marks, abrasions and pits, any of which 
imperfections are deeper than 1/16 in. [1.6 mm], and 
10.3.2 Visual impe1fections commonly referred to as scabs, 
seams, laps, tears, or slivers found by exploration in accor­
dance with 10.1 to be deeper than 5 % of the nominal wall 
thickness. 
10.4 At the purchaser's discretion, pipe shall be subject to 
rejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 10.2 are not 
scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is 
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall 
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
10.5 When imperfections or defects are removed by 
grinding, a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the 
wall thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by.

this specification. The outside diameter at the point of grinding 
may be reduced by the amount so removed. 
10.5.l Wall thickness measurements shall be made with a 
mechanical caliper or with a properly calibrated nondestrnctive 
testing device of appropriate accuracy. In case of dispute, the 
measurement determined by use of the mechanical caliper shall 
govern. 
10.6 Weld repair shall be permitted only subject to the 
approval of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification 
A999/A999M. 
10.7 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight. 
11. General Requirements 
11.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the applicable requirements of the current edition of Specifi­
cation A999/A999M unless otherwise provided herein. 
12. Mechanical Testing 
12.l Sampling-For mechanical testing, the term "lot" ap­
plies to all pipe of the same nominal size and wall thickness ( or 
schedule) that is produced from the same heat of steel and 
subjected to the same finishing treatment in a continuous 
furnace. If the final heat treatment is in a batch-type furnace, 
the lot shall include only those pipes that are heat treated in the 
same furnace charge. 
12.2 Transverse or Longitudinal Tensile Test and Flattening 
Test-For material heat treated in a batch-type furnace, tests 
shall be made on 5 % of the pipe from each lot. If heat treated 
by the continuous process, tests shall be made on a sufficient 
number of pipe to constitute 5 % of the lot, but in no case less 
than 2 pipes. 
12.3 Impact Test-One notched bar impact test, consisting 
of breaking three specimens, shall be made from each heat 
represented in a heat-treatment load on specimens taken from 
the finished pipe. This test shall represent only pipe from the 
same heat and the same heat-treatment load, the wall thick­
nesses of which do not exceed by more than¼ in. [6.3 mm] the 
wall thicknesses of the pipe from which the test specimens are 
taken. If heat treatment is performed in continuous or batch­
type furnaces controlled within a 50 °F [30 °C] range and 
equipped with recording pyrometers so that complete records 
of heat treatment are available, then one test from each heat in 
a continuous run only shall be required instead of one test from 
each heat in each heat-treatment load. 
12.4 Impact Tests (Welded Pipe)-On welded pipe, addi­
tional impact tests of the same number as required in 12.3 shall 
be made to test the weld. 
12.5 Specimens showing defects while being machined or 
prior to testing may be discarded and replacements shall be 
considered as original specimens. 
12.6 Results obtained from these tests shall be reported to 
the purchaser or his representative. 
13. Specimens for Impact Test 
13.1 Notched bar impact specimens shall be of the simple 
beam, Charpy-type, in accordance with Test Methods 
Type A with a V notch. Standard specimens 10 by 10 mm in 
cross section shall be used unless the material to be tested is of 
insufficient thickness, in which case the largest obtainable 
subsize specimens shall be used. Charpy specimens of width 
along the notch larger than 0.394 in. [10 mm] or smaller than 
0.099 in. [2.5 mm] are not provided for in this specification. 
13.2 Test specimens shall be obtained so that the longitudi­
nal axis of the specimen is parallel to the longitudinal axis of 
the pipe while the axis of the notch shall be perpendicular to 
the smface. On wall thicknesses of 1 in. [25 mm] or less, the 
specimens shall be obtained with their axial plane located at the 
midpoint; on wall thicknesses over 1 in. [25 mm], the speci­
mens shall be obtained with their axial plane located ½ in. 
[12.5 mm] from the outer surface. 
13.3 When testing welds the specimen shall be, whenever 
diameter and thickness permit, transverse to the longitudinal 
axis of the pipe with the notch of the specimen in the welded 
joint and perpendicular to the surface. When diameter and 
thickness do not permit obtaining transverse specimens, longi­
tudinal specimens in accordance with 13.2 shall be obtained; 
the bottom of the notch shall be located at the weld joint. 
14. Impact Test 
14.1 Except when the size of the finished pipe is insufficient 
to permit obtaining subsize impact specimens, all material 
furnished to this specification and marked in accordance with 
Section 16 shall be tested for impact resistance at the minimum 
temperature for the respective grades as shown in Table 4. 
14.1.1 Special impact tests on individual lots of material 
may be made at other temperatures as agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
14.1.2 When subsize Charpy impact specimens are used and 
the width along the notch is less than 80 % of the actual wall 
thickness of the miginal material, the specified Charpy impact 
test temperature for Grades 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 shall be 
lower than the minimum temperature shown in Table 4 for the 
respective grade. Under these circumstances the temperature 
reduction values shall be by an amount equal to the difference 
(as shown in Table 6) between the temperature reduction 
corresponding to the actual material thickness and the tempera­
ture reduction corresponding to the Charpy specimen width

temperature reductions are determined. 
14.2 The notched bar impact test shall be made in accor­
dance with the procedure for the simple beam, Charpy-type test 
of Test Methods E23. 
14.3 Impact tests specified for temperatures lower than 70 
°F [20 °C] should be made with the following precautions. The 
impact test specimens as well as the handling tongs shall be 
cooled a sufficient time in a suitable container so that both 
reach the desired temperature. The temperature shall be mea­
sured with thennocouples, thermometers, or any other suitable 
devices and shall be controlled within 3 °F [2 °C]. The 
specimens shall be quickly transferred from the cooling device 
to the anvil of the Charpy impact testing machine and broken 
with a time lapse of not more than 5 s. 
15. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
15.l Each pipe shall be subjected to the nondestructive 
electric test or the hydrostatic test. The type of test to be used 
shall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order. 
15.2 The hydrostatic test shall be in accordance with Speci­
fication A999/A999M. 
15.3 Nondestructive Electric Test-Nondestructive electric 
tests shall be in accordance with Specification A999/ A999M, 
with the following addition: 
15.3.1 If the test signals were produced by visual imperfec­
tions (listed in 15.3.2), the pipe may be accepted based on 
visual examination, provided the imperfection is less than 
0.004 in. (0.1 mm) or 12½ % of the specified wall thickness 
(whichever is greater). 
15.3.2 Visual Imperfections: 
15.3.2.1 Scratches, 
15.3.2.2 Surface roughness,

15.3.2.7 Stop marks, or 
15.3.2.8 Pipe reducer ripple. 
16. Product Marking 
16.1 Except as modified in 16.1.1, in addition to the 
marking prescribed in Specification A999/A999M, the mark­
ing shall include whether hot finished, cold drawn, seamless or 
welded, the schedule number and the letters "LT'' followed by 
the temperature at which the impact tests were made, except 
when a lower test temperature is required because of reduced 
specimen size, in which case, the higher impact test tempera­
ture applicable to a full-size specimen should be marked. 
16.1.1 When the size of the finished pipe is insufficient to 
obtain subsize impact specimens, the marking shall not include 
the letters "LT" followed by an indicated test temperature 
unless Supplementary Requirement Sl is specified. 
16.1.2 When the pipe is furnished in the quenched and 
tempered condition, the marking shall include the letters "QT," 
and the heat treatment condition shall be reported to the 
purchaser or his representative.

APPENDIX 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. DETERMINATION OF TEMPERATURE REDUCTIONS 
Xl.l Under the circumstances stated in 14.1.2, the impact 
test temperatures specified in Table 4 must be lowered. The 
following examples are offered to describe the application of 
the provisions of 14.1.2. 
Xl.1.1 When subsize specimens are used (see 10.1) and the 
width along the notch of the subsize specimen in 80 % or 
greater of the actual wall thickness of the original material, the 
provisions of 14.1.2 do not apply. 
Xl.1.1.l For example, if the actual wall thickness of pipe 
was 0.200 in. [5.0 mm] and the width along the notch of the 
largest subsize specimen obtainable is 0.160 in. [4 mm] or 
greater, no reduction in test temperature is required. 
Xl.1.2 When the width along the subsize specimen notch is 
less than 80 % of the actual wall thickness of the pipe, the 
required reduction in test temperature is computed by taking 
the difference between the temperature reduction values shown 
in Table 6 for the actual pipe thickness and the specimen width 
used. 
Xl.1.2.l For example, if the pipe were 0.262 in. [6.67 mm] 
thick and the width along the Charpy specimen notch was 3.33 
mm (1/3 standard size), the test temperature would have to be 
lowered by 25 °F [14 °C]. That is, the temperature reduction 
corresponding to the subsize specimen is 35 °F [19 °C]; the 
temperature reduction corresponding to the actual pipe thick­
ness is 10 °F [5 °C]; the difference between these two values is 
the required reduction in test temperature.

1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers several grades of mini­
mum-wall-thickness, seamless and welded, carbon and 
alloy-steel tubes intended for use at low temperatures. 
Some product sizes may not be available under this speci­
fication because heavier wall thicknesses have an adverse 
affect on low-temperature impact properties. 
1.2 Supplementary Requirement S 1 of an optional 
nature is provided. This shall apply only when specified 
by the purchaser. 
NOTE 1 - For tubing smaller than ½ in. [12. 7 mm] in outside diameter, 
the elongation values given for strip specimens in Table 1 shall apply. 
Mechanical property requirements do not apply to tubing smaller than ½ 
in. [3.2 mm] in outside diameter and with a wall thickness under O.QlS 
in. [0.4 mm]. 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification. The inch-pound units shall apply 
unless the "M" designation of this specification is specified 
in the order.

turer by either of the following methods. 
6.2.1 Quenched and Tempered - Heat to a unifom1 
temperature of 1475 ± 25°F [800 ± l5°C]; hold at this 
temperature for a minimum time in the ratio of 1 h/in. 
[2 min/mm] of thiclmess, but in no case less than 15 min; 
quench by immersion in circulating water. Reheat until the 
pipe attains a uniform temperature within the range from 
1050 to 1125°F [565 to 605°C]; hold at this temperature 
for a minimum time in the ratio of 1 h/in. [2 min/mm] of 
thickness, but in no case less than 15 min; cool in air or 
water quench at a rate no less than 300°F [165°C]/h. 
6.2.2 Double Normalized and Tempered - Heat to 
a unifonn temperature of 1650 ± 25°F [900 ± 15°C]; hold 
at this temperature for a minimum time in the ratio of 1 
h/in. [2 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 
15 min; cool in air. Reheat until the pipe attains a uniform 
temperature of 1450 ± 25°F [790 ± l5°C]; hold at this 
temperature for a minimum time in the ratio of 1 h/in. 
[2 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 15 min; 
cool in air. Reheat to a uniform temperature within the 
range from 1050 to 1125°F [565 to 605°C]; hold at this 
temperature for a minimum time of 1 h/in. [2 min/mm] of 
thickness but in no case less than 15 min; cool in air or 
water quench at a rate not less than 300°F [165°C]/h. 
6.3 Material from which impact specimens are obtained 
shall be in the same condition of heat treatment as the

6.4 Whether to anneal Grade 11 tubes is per agreement 
between purchaser and supplier. When Grade 11 tubes are 
annealed they shall be normalized in the range of 1400 to 
1600°F [760 to 870°C]. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
7.2 When Grades 1 or 6 are ordered under this specifi­
cation, supplying an alloy grade that specifically requires 
the addition of any element other than those listed for the 
ordered grade in Table 1 is not pennitted. However, the 
addition of elements required for the deoxidation of the 
steel is permitted. 
8. Product Analysis 
8.1 An analysis of either one billet or one length of 
flat-rolled stock or one tube shall be made for each heat. 
The chemical composition thus determined shall conform 
to the requirements specified. 
8.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests 
of two additional billets, lengths of flat-rolled stock, or 
tubes shall be made. Both retests, for the elements in ques­
tion, shall meet the requirements of the specification; other­
wise all remaining material in the heat or lot shall be 
rejected or, at the option of the manufacturer, each billet, 
length of flat-rolled stock, or tube may be individually 
tested for acceptance. Billets, lengths of flat-rolled stock, 
or tubes which do not meet the requirements of the specifi­
cation shall be rejected. 
9 Sampling 
495 
9.1 For flattening, flare, and flange requirements, the 
term lot applies to all tubes prior to cutting of the same 
nominal size and wall thickness which are produced from 
the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a 
batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
the same size and from the same heat which are heat treated 
in the same furnace charge. When the final heat treatment 
is in a continuous furnace, the number of tubes of the same 
size and from the same heat in a lot shall be determined 
from the size of the tubes as prescribed in Table 2. 
9.2 For tensile and hardness test requirements, the term 
lot applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal 
diameter and wall thickness which are produced from the 
same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a batch­
type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the 
same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the 
same furnace charge. When the final heat treatment is in 
a continuous furnace, a lot shall include,aU tubes of the 
same size and heat, heat treated in the same furnace at the 
same temperature, time at heat and furnace speed. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 The material shall conform to the requirements 
as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 3.

=== Page 548 ===

SA-334/SA-334M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
11. Hardness Requirements 
11.1 The tubes shall have a hardness number not 
exceeding those prescribed in Table 4. 
12. Impact Requirements 
12.1 For Grades 1, 3, 6, 7 and 9, the notched-bar impact 
properties of each set of three impact specimens, including 
specimens for the welded joint in welded pipe with wall 
thicknesses of0.120 in. [3 mm] and larger, when tested at 
temperatures in conformance with 14.1 shall be not less 
than the values prescribed in Table 5. The impact test is 
not required for Grade 11. 
12.1.1 If the impact value of one specimen is below 
the minimum value, or the impact values of two specimens 
are less than the minimum average value but not below 
the minimum value permitted on a single specimen, a retest 
shall be allowed. The retest shall consist of breaking three 
additional specimens and each specimen must equal or 
exceed the required average value. When an erratic result 
is caused by a defective specimen, or there is uncertainty 
in test procedures, a retest will be allowed. 
12.2 For Grade 8 each of the notched bar impact speci­
mens shall display a lateral expansion opposite the notch 
not less than 0.Gl5 in. [0.38 mm]. • 
12.2.1 When the average lateral expansion value for 
the three impact specimens equals or exceeds 0.015 in. 
[0.38 mm] and the value for one specimen is below 
0.015 in. [0.38 mm] but not below 0.010 in. [0.25 mm], 
a retest of three additional specimens may be made. The 
lateral expansion of each of the retest specimens must equal 
or exceed 0.015 in. [0.38 mm]. 
12.2.2 Lateral expansion values shall be determined 
in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
12.2.3 The values of absorbed energy in foot-pounds 
and the fracture appearance in percentage shear shall be 
recorded for information. A record of these values shall 
be retained for a period of at least 2 years. 
13. Mechanical Tests 
13.1 Tension Test - One tension test shall be made on 
a specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension 
tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes for lots 
of more than 50 tubes. 
13.2 Flattening Test - One flattening test shall be made 
on specimens from each end of one finished tube of each 
lot but not the one used for the flare or flange test. 
13.3 Flare Test (Seamless Tubes)- One flare test shall 
be made on specimens from each end of one finished tube 
of each lot, but not the one used for the flattening test. 
13.4 Flange Test (Welded Tubes) - One flange test 
shall be made on specimens from each end of one finished 
tube of each lot, but not the one used for the flattening test. 
13.5 Reverse Flattening Test - For welded tubes, one 
reverse flattening test shall be made on a specimen from 
each 1500 ft [460 m] of finished tubing. 
13.6 Hardness Test - Brinell or Rockwell hardness 
tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes from 
each lot. 
13.7 Impact Tests - One notched-bar impact test, con­
sisting of breaking three specimens, shall be made from 
each heat represented in a heat-treatment load on specimens 
taken from the finished tube. This test shall represent only 
tubes from the same heat, which have wall thicknesses not 
exceeding by more than¼ in. [6.3 mm] the wall thicknesses 
of the tube from which the test specimens are taken. If 
heat treatment is performed in continuous or batch-type 
furnaces controlled within a 50°F [30°C] range and 
equipped with recording pyrometers which yield complete 
heat-treatment records, then one test from each heat in a 
continuous run only shall be required instead of one test 
from each heat in each heat-treatment load. 
13.8 Impact Tests (Welded Tubes) - On welded tube, 
additional impact tests of the same number as required in 
13.7 shall be made to test the weld. 
13.9 Specimens showing defects while being machined 
or prior to testing may be discarded and replacements shall 
be considered as original specimens. 
496 
14. Specimens for Impact Test 
14.1 Notched-bar impact specimens shall be of the 
simple beam, Charpy-type, in accordance with Test Meth­
ods E 23, Type A, with a V notch. Standard specimens 10 
by 10 mm in cross section shall be used unless the material 
to be tested is of insufficient thickness, in which case the 
largest obtainable subsize specimens shall be used. Charpy 
specimens of width along the notch larger than 0.394 in. 
[10 mm] or smaller than 0.099 in. [2.5 mm] are not provided 
for in this specification. 
14.2 Test specimens shall be obtained so that the longi­
tudinal axis of the specimen is parallel to the longitudinal 
axis of the tube while the axis of the notch shall be perpen­
dicular to the surface. On wall thicknesses of 1 in. [25 mm] 
or less, the specimens shall be obtained with their axial 
plane located at the midpoint; on wall thicknesses over 1 
in. [25 mm], the specimens shall be obtained with their 
axial plane located½ in. [12.5 mm] from the outer surface. 
14.3 When testing welds the specimen shall be, when­
ever diameter and thickness permits, transverse to the lon­
gitudinal axis of the tube with the notch of the specimen

=== Page 549 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-334/SA-334M 
in the welded joint and perpendicular to the surface. When 
diameter and thickness does not pennit obtaining trans­
verse specimens, longitudinal specimens in accordance 
with 14.2 shall be obtained. The bottom of the notch shall 
be located at the weld joint. 
15. Impact Test 
15.1 Except when the size of the finished tube is insuf­
ficient to pennit obtaining subsize impact specimens, all 
material furnished under this specification and marked in 
accordance with Section 17 shall be tested for impact resist­
ance at the temperature for the respective grades as pre­
scribed in Table 6. 
15.1.1 Special impact tests on individual lots of 
material may be made at other temperatures if agreed upon 
between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
15.2 The notched-bar impact test shall be made in 
accordance with the procedure for the simple beam, 
Charpy-type of test of Test Methods E 23. 
15.3 Impact tests specified for temperatures lower than 
+ 70°F [20°C] should be made with the following precau­
tions. The impact test specimens as well as the handling 
tongs shall be cooled a sufficient time in a suitable container 
so that both reach the desired temperature. The temperature 
shall be measured with thermocouples, thermometers, or 
any other suitable devices and shall be controlled within 
±3°F [2°C]. The specimens shall be quickly transferred 
from the cooling device to the anvil of the Charpy impact 
testing machine and broken with a time lapse of not more 
than 5 s. 
15.4 When subsize Charpy impact specimens are used 
and the width along the notch is less than 80% of the actual 
wall thickness of the original material, the specified Charpy 
impact test temperature for Grades 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9 shall 
be lower than the minimum temperature shown in Table 
6 for the respective grade. Under these circumstances the 
temperature reduction values shall be by an amount equal 
to the difference (as shown in Table 7) between the temper­
ature reduction corresponding to the actual material thick­
ness and the temperature reduction corresponding to 
Charpy specimen width actually tested. The appendix 
shows some examples of how the temperature reductions 
are detennined. 
16. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
16.1 Each tube shall be subjected to the nondestructive 
electric test or the hydrostatic test in accordance with Speci­
fication A 1016/ A 1016M. The type oftest to be used shall 
be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order. 
17. Product Marking 
17.1 Except as modified in 16.1.1, in addition to the 
marking prescribed in Specification A 1016/ A 1016M, the 
marking shall include whether hot-finished, cold-drawn, 
seamless, or welded, and the letters "LT" followed by the 
temperature at which the impact tests were made, except 
when a lower test temperature is required because of 
reduced specimen size, in which case, the higher impact 
test temperature applicable to a full-size specimen should 
be marked. 
17.1.1 When the size of the finished tube is insuffi­
cient to obtain subsize impact specimens, the marking shall 
not include the letters LT followed by an indicated test 
temperature unless Supplementary Requirement S 1 is spec­
ified.

APPENDIX 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. DETERMINATION OF TEMPERATURE 
REDUCTIONS 
Xl.1 Under the circumstances stated in 15 .4, the impact 
test temperatures specified in Table 6 must be lowered. 
The following examples are offered to describe the applica­
tion of the provisions of 15.4. 
Xl.1.1 When subsize specimens are used (see 14.1) 
and the width along the notch of the subsize specimen is 
80% or greater of the actual wall thickness of the original 
material, the provisions of 15.4 do not apply. 
Xl.1.1.1 For example, if the actual wall thickness 
of pipe was 0.200 in. [5.0 mm] and the width along the 
notch of the largest subsize specimen obtainable is 0.160 
in. [4 mm] or greater, no reduction in test temperature is 
required. 
503 
Xl.1.2 When the width along the subsize specimen 
notch is less than 80% of the actual wall thickness of the 
pipe, the required reduction in test temperature is computed 
by taking the difference between the temperature reduction 
values shown in Table 7 for the actual pipe thickness and 
the specimen width used. 
Xl.1.2.1 For example, if the pipe were 0.262 in. 
[6.67 mm] thick and the width along the Charpy specimen 
notch was 3.33 mm(½ standard size), the test temperature 
would have to be lowered by 25°F [l4°C] (that is, the 
temperature reduction corresponding to the subsize speci­
men is 35°F [l9°C], the temperature reduction correspond­
ing to the actual pipe thickness is 10°F [5°C]; the difference 
between these two values is the required reduction in test 
temperature).

NoTB 3-lt is recommended that the temperature for tempering should 
be at least 100 °F [50 °C] above the intended service temperature; 
consequently, the purchaser should advise the manufacturer if the service 
temperature is to be over 1100 °F [600 °C]. 
N OTB 4-Certain of the ferritic steels covered by this specification will 
harden if cooled rapidly from above their critical temperature. Some will 
air harden, that is, become hardened to an undesirable degree when cooled 
in air from high temperatures. Therefore, operations involving heating 
such steels above their critical temperatures, such as welding, flanging, 
and hot bending, should be followed by suitable heat treatment. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
7. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
7 .1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient number 
of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable assurance 
that they have been properly evaluated with respect to depth. 
Exploration of all surface imperfections is not required but may 
be necessary to ensure compliance with 7.2. 
7.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 12½ % 
of the nominal wall thickness or encroach on the minimum 
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with such 
defects shall be given one of the following dispositions: 
7.2.1 The defect may be removed by grinding provided that 
the remaining wall thickness is within specified limits. 
7.2.2 Repaired in accordance with the repair welding pro­
visions of 7.6. 
7 .2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect may be cut 
off within the limits of requirements on length. 
7 .2.4 Rejected. 
7.3 To provide a workmanlike finish and basis for evaluat­
ing conformance with 7.2, the pipe manufacturer shall remove 
by grinding the following: 
7.3.1 Mechanical marks, abrasions (!'fee Note 5) and pits, 
any of which imperfections are deeper than 1/16 in. [1.6 mm]. 
NoTB 5-Marks and abrasions are defined as cable marks, dinges, guide 
marks, roll marks, ball scratches, scores, die marks, and the like. 
7.3.2 Visual imperfections, commonly referred to as scabs, 
seams, laps, tears, or slivers, found by exploration in accor­
dance with 7 .1 to be deeper than 5 % of the nominal wall 
thickness. 
7.4 At the purchaser's discretion, pipe shall be subject to 
rejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 7.2 are not 
scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is 
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall 
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
7 .5 When imperfections or defects are removed by grinding, 
a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the wall 
thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by this

13. Nondestructive Examination 
13.1 When required by 12.1.2 or 12.2 above, or when 
specified in the purchase order in addition to the hydrostatic 
test (12.2.3), each pipe shall be examined by a nondestructive 
examination method in accordance with Practice E213, Prac­
tice E309, or Practice E570. Except for Grades P91 Type 1 and 
Type 2, P92, P93, P115, P911, Pl22, and P128, the type of 
nondestructive examination shall be at the option of the 
manufacturer, unless otherwise specified in the order. Grades 
P91 Type 1 and Type 2, P92, P115, P911, P122, and P128 shall 
be examined by an examination method in accordance with 
Practice E213. When specified in the order, pipe of Grades P91 
Type 1 and Type 2, P92, P93, P115, P911, P122, and P128 shall 
be examined by an examination method in accordance with 
Practices E309 or E570, in addition to the examination method 
in accordance with Practice E213. The range of pipe sizes that 
may be examined by each method shall be subject to the 
limitations in the scope of the respective practices. 
13.2 Following conditions apply in lieu or in addition to 
those in Specification A999/A999M: 
13.2.1 The width of the notch shall not exceed the depth. 
13.2.2 If upon any standardization, the reference signal 
amplitude has decreased by more than 25 % (2 db), the test 
apparatus shall be considered out of standardization. The test 
system settings may be changed, or the transducer(s), coil(s) or 
sensor(s) adjusted, and the unit restandardized, but all pipe 
tested since the last acceptable standardization shall be re­
tested. 
13.2.3 Pipes producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
signal produced by the reference standard shall be subject to 
one of the following four dispositions: 
13.2.3.1 The pipes may be rejected without further 
examination, at the discretion of the manufacturer. 
13.2.3.2 The pipes shall be rejected if the test signal was 
produced by imperfections which cannot be identified, or was 
produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. 
13.2.3.3 The pipes may be repaired by grinding (in accor­
dance with 7.2.1), welding (in accordance with 7.6) or section­
ing (in accordance with 7.2.3). To be accepted, a repaired pipe 
must pass the same nondestructive examination by which it 
was rejected, and it must meet the remaining wall thickness 
requirements of this specification. 
13.2.3.4 If the test signals were produced by visual imper­
fections such as those listed below, the pipes may be evaluated 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 7: 
( a) Scratches, 
(b) Surface roughness, 
(c) Dings, 
( d) Straightener marks, 
( e) Cutting chips, 
(f) Steel die stamps, 
( g) Stop marks, or 
(h) Pipe reducer ripple. 
14. Mechanical Tests Required 
14.1 Lot-For mechanical testing, a lot is all pipe of the 
same nominal size and wall thickness ( or schedule) which is 
produced from the same heat of steel and subjected to the same 
finishing treatment in a continuous furnace; when final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, the lot shall include only 
that pipe which is heat treated in the same furnace charge. 
14.2 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test and Flatten­
ing or Bend Test-For material heat treated in a batch-type 
furnace, tests shall be made on 5 % of the pipe from each 
treated lot. For small lots, at least 1 pipe shall be tested. For 
material heat treated by the continuous process, tests shall be 
made on a sufficient number of pipe to constitute 5 % of the lot, 
but in no case less than 2 pipe. Unless otherwise specified, the 
flattening test or bend test shall be chosen at the manufacturer's 
option. 
513 
14.3 Hardness Test: 
14.3.1 The Vickers hardness testing shall be made in accor­
dance with Test Method E92. 
14.3.2 For pipes with wall thickness 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] or 
over, either the Brinell or Rockwell hardness test shall be used. 
When Brinell hardness testing is used, a 10-mm ball with 3000, 
1500, or 500-kg load shall be used at the option of the 
manufacturer. 
14.3.3 For pipes with wall thickness 0.065 in. [1.7 mm] or 
over, but less than 0.200 in. [5.1 mm], the Rockwell hardness 
test shall be used. 
14.3.4 For pipes with wall thickness less than 0.065 in. [1.7 
mm], the hardness test shall not be required. 
14.3.5 The Brinell test shall be made, at the option of the 
manufacturer, on the outside of the pipe near the end, on the 
outside of a specimen cut from the pipe, or on the wall cross 
section of a specimen cut from the pipe. This test shall be made 
so that the center of the impression to the edge of the specimen 
is at least 2.5 times the diameter of the impression. 
14.3.6 The Rockwell hardness test shall, at the option of the 
manufacturer, be made on the inside surface, on the wall cross 
section, or on a flat of the outside surface. 
14.3.7 For pipe of Grades P23, P24, P36, P91 Type 1 and 
Type 2, P92, P93, P115, Pl22, P128, and P911, Brinell,

=== Page 566 ===

SA-335/SA-335M (ASTM A335/A335M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Vickers, or Rockwell hardness tests shall be made on one 
specimen from each lot. For pipe of all other grades, a hardness 
test is not required. 
14.4 Flattening Test: 
14.4.1 The flattening test of Specification A999/A999M 
shall be made on a specimen from one end of the pipe with the 
number of tests as specified in 14.2. Crop ends may be used. If 
a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility 
prior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening 
test requirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat­
ment in accordance with Specification A999/ A999M and 
satisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails 
because of a lack of soundness that length shall be rejected, 
unless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length 
is sound. 
14.5 Bend Test: 
14.5.1 For pipe whose diameter exceeds NPS 25 and whose 
diameter to wall thickness ratio is 7.0 or less shall be subjected 
to the bend test instead of the flattening test. Other pipe whose 
diameter equals or exceeds NPS 10 may be given the bend test 
in place of the flattening test subject to the approval of the 
purchaser. 
14.5.2 The bend test specimens shall be bent at room 
temperature through 180° without cracking on the outside of 
the bent portion. The inside diameter of the bend shall be 1 in. 
[25 mm]. 
14.5 .3 Test specimens for the bend test shall be cut from one 
end of the pipe with the number of tests as specified in 14.2 
and, unless otherwise specified, shall be taken in a transverse 
direction. One test specimen shall be taken as close to the outer 
surface as possible and another from as close to the inner 
surface as possible. The specimens shall be either ½ by ½ in. 
[12.5 by 12.5 mm] in section or 1 by ½ in. [25 by 12.5 mm] in 
section with the comers rounded to a radius not over 1/16 in. 
[1.6 mm] and need not exceed 6 in. [150 mm] in length. The 
side of the samples placed in tension during the bend shall be 
the side closest to the inner and outer surface of the pipe, 
respectively. 
15. Certification 
15.1 Certification and test reports, as described in Section 
25 of Specification A999/A999M, are required. 
15.2 In addition to the information required by Specification 
A999/ A999M, the certification shall state whether or not the 
pipe was hydrostatically tested. If the pipe was nondestruc­
tively examined, the certification shall so state and shall show 
which practice was followed and what reference discontinuities 
were used. In addition, the test method information as given in 
Table 9 shall be appended to the specification number and 
grade shown on the certification. 
16. Product Marking 
16.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A999/A999M, the marking shall include the length, an addi­
tional symbol "S", if the pipe conforms to any of the Supple­
mentary Requirements Sl to S6, the schedule number, if the 
pipe is ordered to a schedule number, and the heat number or 
manufacturer's number by which the heat can be identified. 
Furthermore, the marking designated in Table 9 to indicate the 
test method(s) shall be included. Marking may be by stenciling, 
stamping, or rolling. Pipe that has been weld repaired in 
accordance with 7.6 shall be marked "WR." 
16.2 P91 shall be additionally marked with the appropriate 
Type. 
17. Government Procurement 
17 .1 Scale Free Pipe: 
17 .1.1 When specified in the contract or order, the following 
requirements shall be considered in the inquiry contract or 
order, for agencies of the U.S. Government where scale free 
pipe is required. These requirements shall take precedence if 
there is a conflict between these requirements and the product 
specification. 
17 .1.2 The requirements of Specification A999/ A999M for

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUffiEMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the 
purchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided 
in the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, 
retest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. 
Sl. Product Analysis 
S 1. 1 Product analysis shall be made on each length of pipe. 
Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical compo­
sition requirements shall be rejected. 
S2. Transverse Tension Tests 
S2.1 A transverse tension test shall be made on a specimen 
from one end or both ends of each pipe NPS 8 and over. If this 
supplementary requirement is specified, the number of tests per 
pipe shall also be specified. If a specimen from any length fails 
to meet the required tensile properties (tensile, yield, and 
elongation), that length shall be rejected subject to retreatment 
in accordance with Specification A999/A999M and satisfac­
tory retest. 
S3. Flattening Test 
S3.l The flattening test of Specification A999/A999M shall 
be made on a specimen from one end or both ends of each pipe. 
Crop ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is 
specified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. 
If a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility 
prior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening 
test requirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat­
ment in accordance with Specification A999/A999M and 
satisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails 
because of a lack of soundness that length shall be rejected, 
unless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length 
is sound. The bend test shall be substituted for the flattening 
test for pipe whose diameter exceeds NPS 25 and whose 
diameter to wall thickness ratio is 7 .0 or less. 
S4. Metal Structure and Etching Tests 
S4. l The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching 
tests conducted in accordance with the appropriate portions of 
Method E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section 
from one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound 
and reasonably uniform material free from injurious 
laminations, cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this 
supplementary requirement is specified, the number of tests per 
pipe required shall also be specified. If a specimen from any 
length shows objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, 
subject to removal of the defective end and subsequent retests 
indicating the remainder of the length to be sound and 
reasonably uniform material. 
Norn S4.1-Pending development of etching methods applicable to the 
product covered by this specification, it is recommended that the Recom­
mended Practice for a Standard Macro Etch Test for Routine Inspection of 
Iron and Steel, described in the Metals Handbook, Am. Soc. for Metals, 
1948 edition, p. 389, be followed. 
SS. Photomicrographs 
S5.1 When requested by the purchaser and so stated in the 
order, the manufacturer shall furnish one photomicrograph at 
100 diameters from a specimen of pipe in the as-finished 
condition for each individual size and wall thickness from each 
heat, for pipe NPS 3 and over. Such photomicrographs shall be 
suitably identified as to pipe size, wall thickness, and heat. No 
photomicrographs for the individual pieces purchased shall be 
required except as specified in Supplementary Requirement S6. 
Such photomicrographs are for information only, to show the 
actual metal structure of the pipe as finished.

INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Carbon and Low-Alloy Steel Forgings, Requiring Notch 
Toughness Testing for Piping Components 1 
This standard is issned under the fixed designation A350/ A350M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers several grades of carbon and 
low-alloy steel forged or ring-rolled flanges, forged fittings and 
valves intended primarily for low-temperature service and 
requiring notch toughness testing. They are made to specified 
dimensions, or to dimensional standards, such as the ASME 
and API Specifications referenced in Section 2. Although this 
specification covers some piping components machined from 
rolled bar and seamless tubular materials (see 5.3.3), it does not 
cover raw material produced in these product forms. 
1.2 No limitation on size is intended beyond the ability of 
the manufacturer to obtain the specified requirements. 
However, Class 3 of Grade LF787 is only available in the 
quenched-and-precipitation heat treated condition. 
1.3 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when 
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply 
only when specified by the purchaser in the order. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, 
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee 
AOl.22 on Steel Forgings and Wrought Fittings for Piping Applications and Bolting 
Materials for Piping and Special Purpose Applications.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order information necessary to purchase the needed 
material. In addition to the ordering information guidelines in 
Specification A961/A961M, orders should include the follow­
ing information: 
3.1.1 The number of test reports required (see Section 14). 
3.1.2 Additional requirements (see Table 1 footnotes). 
3.1.3 Options in the specification. See 5.4.2.1. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A961/A961M, including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase 
order. Failure to comply with the general requirements of 
Specification A961/A961M constitutes nonconformance with 
this specification. In case of conflict between the requirements 
of this specification and Specification A961/A961M, this 
specification shall prevail. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 Melting Process-The steel shall be produced by any of 
the following primary processes: open-hearth, basic oxygen, 
electric-furnace, or vacuum-induction melting (VIM). The 
primary melting may incorporate separate degassing or 
refining, and may be followed by secondary melting using 
electroslag remelting (ESR), or vacuum-arc remelting (VAR). 
5.1.1 The steel shall be fully killed, fine-grain practice. 
5.1.2 The molten steel may be vacuum treated prior to or 
during pouring of the ingot. 
5.2 Discard-A sufficient discard shall be made to secure 
freedom from injurious piping and undue segregation. 
5.3 Forging Process: 
5.3.1 Material for forgings shall consist of ingots, or forged, 
rolled, or strandcast blooms, billets, slabs, or bars. 
5.3.2 The finished product shall be a forging as defined in 
the Terminology section of Specification A788/A788M. 
5.3.3 Hollow parts may be machined from rolled bar or 
seamless tubular materials provided the longitudinal axis of the 
part is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bar. Other parts, 
up to and including NPS4, may be machined from hot-rolled or 
forged bar provided the longitudinal axis of the part is parallel 
to the longitudinal axis of the bar. Flanges, elbows, return 
bends, tees, and header tees shall not be machined directly 
from bar stock. 
5.4 Heat Treatment: 
5.4.1 After hot working and before reheating for heat 
treatment, the forging shall be allowed to cool substantially 
below the transformation range. 
5.4.2 Forgings of grades other than Grade LF787 shall be 
furnished in the normalized, or normalized and tempered, or 
quenched and tempered condition. At the option of the 
manufacturer, forgings furnished in the quenched and tempered 
condition may be normalized prior to the austenitize/quench 
operation. 
5.4.2.1 Quenching shall consist of either: 
( 1) fully austenitizing the forgings followed by quenching 
in a suitable liquid medium, or . 
(2) using a multiple stage procedure whereby the forging is 
first fully austenitized and rapidly cooled, then reheated to 
partially re-asutenitize, followed by quenching in a suitable 
liquid medium. 
( 3) Unless otherwise specified by the purchaser, the choice 
of (J) or (2) shall be at the option of the manufacturer. 
5.4.2.2 All quenched forgings shall be tempered to 5.4.2.3 
5.4.2.3 Forgings, when tempered, shall be tempered at 
1100 °F [590 °C], minimum, holding at temperature a mini­
mum of 30 min/in. [30 min/25 mm] of maximum thickness, but 
in no case less than 30 min. 
5.4.3 Grade LF787 forgings shall be furnished in either the 
normalized-and-precipitation heat treated condition or in the 
quenched-and-precipitation heat treated condition. The heat 
treatment procedures shall be as follows: 
5.4.3.1 Normalized-and-Precipitation Heat Treated­
Austenitize in the range from 1600 to 1725 °F [870 to 940 °C]

6.1 Heat Analysis: 
6.1.1 A chemical heat analysis in accordance with Specifi­
cation A961/A961M shall be made and conform to the 
requirements as to chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
Leaded steels shall not be permitted. 
6.2 Product Analysis: 
6.2.1 The purchaser may make a product analysis on prod­
ucts supplied to this specification in accordance with Specifi­
cation A961/A961M. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Tension Tests: 
7.1.1 Requirements-The material shall conform to require­
ments for tensile properties in Table 2. 
7 .1.1.1 The test specimen shall be obtained from a rough or 
finished forging, or prolongation thereof. For forgings under 
10 000 lbs, at time of heat treatment, it may be obtained from 
separately forged test blanks from the same heat of steel as the 
production forgings. The test blank shall be reduced by forging 
in a manner similar to that for the products represented, and 
shall receive approximately the same hot working and reduc­
tion and the same heat treatment as the finished products 
represented. The test material shall be treated in the same 
furnace at the same time as the forging it represents, subject to 
the requirements of 7 .1.2.1. 
7 .1.1.2 The test specimen shall represent all forgings from 
the same heat and heat-treatment load whose maximum thick­
nesses do not exceed the thickness of the test forging or blank 
by more than ¼ in. [6 mm]. 
7 .1.2 Number of Tests-One tension test at room tempera­
ture shall be made in accordance with 7 .1.1.2 from each heat in 
each heat-treatment load. 
7 .1.2.1 If heat treatment is performed in either a continuous 
or a batch-type furnace controlled within ±25 °F [±14 °C] of 
the required heat-treatment temperature and equipped with 
recording pyrometers so that complete records of heat treat­
ment are available and if the same heat-treating cycles are used 
on the forgings represented by the tension test, then one tension 
test from each heat shall be required, instead of one tension test 
from each heat in each heat treatment load in accordance with 
7.1.1.2. 
7 .1.3 Test Locations and Orientations-The test specimen 
shall be removed from the heaviest section of the forging or 
test blank, at locations described in 7.1.3.1, 7.1.3.2, 7.1.3.5 or 
as close to these locations as practical, subject to forging size 
and geometry. 
7.1.3.1 For forgings or test blanks having a maximum 
heat-treated thickness, T, of 2 in. [50 mm] or less, the 
longitudinal axis of the test specimen shall be taken at 
mid-thickness and its mid-length shall be at least 2 in. [50 mm] 
from all other heat treated surfaces, exclusive of the T 
dimension surfaces. (This is normally referred to as V2 T by 2 
in. [50 mm]). See Fig. 1 for test specimen location in separately 
forged test blanks.

NoTE 1-For clarity, only the Charpy V-notch specimen is shown in Figs. 1-4. The tension test specimen shall be located such that its orientation and 
the mid-length location meet the same requirements as that for the Charpy V-notch test specimen shown in Figure 1. 
FIG. 1 Separately Forged Test Bar for Forgings with T ,,; 2 in. [50 mm] 
(1) Except as stated in 7.1.3.2 (2) and 7.1.3.2 (3), the 
central axis of the test specimen shall be taken at least ¼ T 
from the nearest heat-treated surface and its mid-length shall be 
at least 2 in. [50 mm] from all other heat treated surfaces, 
exclusive of the T dimension surfaces. See Fig. 2 for test 
specimen location in separately forged test blanks. 
(2) For quenched-and-tempered or for quenched-and­
precipitation-heat-treated forgings, the central axis of the test 
specimen shall be taken at least ¼ T from the nearest heat­
treated surface, and the mid- length of the test specimen shall be 
at least T from all other heat treated surfaces, exclusive of the 
T dimension surfaces. See Fig. 3 for test specimen location in 
separately forged test blanks. 
(3) For quenched-and-tempered or for quenched-and­
precipitation-heat-treated forgings that have a W/T ratio < 2, 
the central axis of the test specimen shall be taken at least ¼ T 
from the nearest heat-treated surface, and at mid-width of the 
forging, where Wis the width of the forging. The test specimen 
mid-length shall be at least T from the ends of the forging or 
test blank. See Fig. 4 for test specimen location in separately 
forged test blank. 
7.1.3.3 Metal Buffers-The required distances from heat 
treated surfaces for the test locations described in 7.1.3.1 and 
7.1.3.2 may be obtained with metal buffers instead of integral 
expansions. Buffer material may be carbon or low alloy steel, 
and shall be joined to the forging with a partial penetration 
weld that seals the buffered surface. Specimens shall be located 
at½ in. [13 mm] minimum from the buffered surface of the 
forging. Buffers shall be removed after heat treatment and the 
welded areas subjected to magnetic particle test to assure 
freedom from cracks unless the welded areas are completely 
removed by subsequent machining. 
7.1.3.4 The test specimen shall have its longitudinal axis 
located parallel to the direction of major working of the forging 
or test blank. 
7.1.3.5 With prior purchaser approval, tests may be taken at 
a depth (t) corresponding to the distance from the area of 
significant loading to the nearest heat treated surface and at 
least twice this distance (2t) from any second surface. 
However, the test depth shall not be nearer to one treated 
surface than¾ in. [19 mm] and to the second treated surface 
than 1 ½ in. [38 mm]. This method of test location would 
normally apply to contour-forged parts, or parts with thick 
cross-sectional areas where ¼ T x T testing (7.1.3.2) is not 
practical. Sketches showing the exact test locations shall be 
approved by the purchaser when this method is used. 
7 .1.4 Test Method-Testing shall be performed as specified 
in Specification A961/A961M. The test specimen shall be as 
large as is practicable and shall be machined to the form and 
dimensions in Specification A961/A961M. When seamless 
tubular materials are used, testing shall be performed on 
longitudinal specimens as specified in Specification A961/ 
A961M. 
531 
1.2 Impact Test: 
7 .2.1 Requirements-The material shall conform to the 
requirements for impact properties in Table 3 when tested at 
the applicable standard temperature in Table 4 within the limits 
of 7.2.4.2 and 7.2.4.3. When subsize specimens are used, the 
impact energy values obtained shall conform to Table 5 at 
energy values proportional to standard size. Exceptions to this 
requirement are permissible when Supplementary Requirement 
S 1 is specified by the purchaser. Impact tests may be made at 
temperatures different from those in Table 4, provided that the

test temperature is at least as low as the intended service 
temperature, and that the forging is suitably marked to identify 
the reported test temperature. 
7.2.1.1 The test specimens shall be machined from material 
obtained as in 7.1. 
7 .2.2 Number of Tests-Three specimens shall constitute 
one test set. There shall be the same number of test sets as 
tension tests in 7.1.2. 
7.2.3 Test Locations and Orientations-The test specimen 
shall be located and oriented as described in 7.1.3. The area 
under the notch of the impact test specimen shall be used to 
locate the specimen with respect to the second heat-treated 
surface. The base of the notch shall be perpendicular to the 
nearest heat-treated surface. 
7.2.4 Test Method-The notched bar impact test shall be 
made in accordance with the procedure for the Charpy V-notch 
type test as specified in Specification A961/A961M. 
7.2.4.1 Standard size specimens shall be used for the impact 
test. Where the material is of insufficient thickness, or the 
shape of the forging precludes standard size, the largest 
obtainable subsize specimen shall be used. 
7.2.4.2 Where subsize specimens are used and represent 
forged material with thicknesses equal to or greater than 
0.394 in. [10 mm], and where the largest obtainable specimen 
has a width along the notch of at least 8 mm, such specimen 
shall be tested at the temperature in Table 4. Where the largest 
obtainable specimen has a width along the notch less than 
8 mm, the temperature for testing shall be lower than the 
temperature in Table 4 by the amount shown in Table 6 for the 
actual specimen width tested. 
532 
7 .2.4.3 Where subsize specimens are used and represent 
forged material with thicknesses less than 0.394 in. [10 mm], 
and where the largest obtainable specimen has a width along 
the notch of at least 80 % of the forging thickness, the 
specimen shall be tested at the temperature in Table 4. Where 
the largest obtainable specimen has a width along the notch of 
less than 80 % of the material thickness, the temperature for 
testing shall be lower than the temperature in Table 4 by an 
amount equal to the difference (referring to Table 6) between 
the temperature reduction corresponding to the thickness of the 
material represented, and the temperature reduction corre­
sponding to the specimen width actually tested. 
7.3 Hardness Test: 
7.3.l Except when only one forging is produced, a mini­
mum of two forgings shall be hardness tested per batch or 
continuous run as defined in 7 .1.2.1 to ensure that hardness of 
the forgings does not exceed 197 HBW after heat treatment for 
mechanical properties. The hardness measurements shall be 
made as specified in Specification A961/A961M. When only 
one forging is produced, it shall be hardness tested to ensure 
that it meets the 197 HB W maximum of this specification. The 
purchaser may verify that this requirement has been met by 
testing at any location on the forging, provided that such 
testing does not render the forging useless. 
8. Hydrostatic Test 
8.1 Forgings manufactured under this specification shall be 
capable of passing a hydrostatic test compatible with the rating

14.1.6 Hardness results, 7.3.1, and 
14.1.7 Any supplementary testing required by the purchase 
order. 
15. Product Marking 
15.1 In addition to the marking requirements of Specifica­
tion A961/A961M, the following additional requirements shall 
apply: 
15.1.1 If the forgings have been quenched and tempered or 
quenched-and-precipitation heat treated, the letters QT shall be 
stamped on the forgings following the ASTM designation. 
15.1.2 Forgings repaired by welding shall be marked with 
the letter W following the ASTM designation. 
15.1.3 If identification stamps are objectionable and detri­
mental to the forging, and when so stated on the purchase 
order, the marks may be painted or stenciled on the forging, or 
stamped on a metal or plastic tag which shall be securely 
attached to the forging. 
535 
15.1.4 Additional marks shall be used as necessary to 
identify the part with the test report. 
15.1.5 If the test temperature is other than the standard 
temperature specified in Table 4, the mark shall also include 
the suffix letter S to the grade and class and the test tempera­
ture. A prefix 0 to the test temperature shall indicate a less than 
0 °F [-18 °C] value. For example, LF2S 0175 denotes a test 
temperature of -175 °F [-115 °C] for an LF2 part .. 
15.1.6 Parts meeting all requirements for more than one 
class may be marked with more than one class such as LF2 
CL1/C12; LF5 CL1/CL2, and so forth. 
15.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 15.1, 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. The bar coding system, if applied at 
the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one of 
the published industry standards for bar coding. If used on 
small parts, the bar code may be applied to the box or a 
substantially applied tag.

Resolved Notes (AI-verified)
NOTE 1 (page 583)
NoTE 1-For clarity, only the Charpy V-notch specimen is shown in Figs. 1-4. The tension test specimen shall be located such that its orientation and 
the mid-length location meet the same requirements as that for the Charpy V-notch test specimen shown in Figure 1. 
FIG. 1 Separately Forged Test Bar for Forgings with T ,,; 2 in. [50 mm] 
(1) Except as stated in 7.1.3.2 (2) and 7.1.3.2 (3), the 
central axis of the test specimen shall be taken at least ¼ T 
from the nearest heat-treated surface and its mid-length shall be 
at least 2 in. [50 mm] from all other heat treated surfaces, 
exclusive of the T dimension surfaces. See Fig. 2 for test 
specimen location in separately forged test blanks. 
(2) For quenched-and-tempered or for quenched-and­
precipitation-heat-treated forgings, the central axis of the test 
specimen shall be taken at least ¼ T from the nearest heat­
treated surface, and the mid- length of the test specimen shall be 
at least T from all other heat treated surfaces, exclusive of the 
T dimension surfaces. See Fig. 3 for test specimen location in 
separately forged test blanks. 
(3) For quenched-and-tempered or for quenched-and­
precipitation-heat-treated forgings that have a W/T ratio < 2, 
the central axis of the test specimen shall be taken at least ¼ T 
from the nearest heat-treated surface, and at mid-width of the 
forging, where Wis the width of the forging. The test specimen 
mid-length shall be at least T from the ends of the forging or 
test blank. See Fig. 4 for test specimen location in separately 
forged test blank. 
7.1.3.3 Metal Buffers-The required distances from heat 
treated surfaces for the test locations described in 7.1.3.1 and 
7.1.3.2 may be obtained with metal buffers instead of integral 
expansions. Buffer material may be carbon or low alloy steel, 
and shall be joined to the forging with a partial penetration 
weld that seals the buffered surface. Specimens shall be located 
at½ in. [13 mm] minimum from the buffered surface of the 
forging. Buffers shall be removed after heat treatment and the 
welded areas subjected to magnetic particle test to assure 
freedom from cracks unless the welded areas are completely 
removed by subsequent machining. 
7.1.3.4 The test specimen shall have its longitudinal axis 
located parallel to the direction of major working of the forging 
or test blank. 
7.1.3.5 With prior purchaser approval, tests may be taken at 
a depth (t) corresponding to the distance from the area of 
significant loading to the nearest heat treated surface and at 
least twice this distance (2t) from any second surface. 
However, the test depth shall not be nearer to one treated 
surface than¾ in. [19 mm] and to the second treated surface 
than 1 ½ in. [38 mm]. This method of test location would 
normally apply to contour-forged parts, or parts with thick 
cross-sectional areas where ¼ T x T testing (7.1.3.2) is not 
practical. Sketches showing the exact test locations shall be 
approved by the purchaser when this method is used. 
7 .1.4 Test Method-Testing shall be performed as specified 
in Specification A961/A961M. The test specimen shall be as 
large as is practicable and shall be machined to the form and 
dimensions in Specification A961/A961M. When seamless 
tubular materials are used, testing shall be performed on 
longitudinal specimens as specified in Specification A961/ 
A961M. 
531 
1.2 Impact Test: 
7 .2.1 Requirements-The material shall conform to the 
requirements for impact properties in Table 3 when tested at 
the applicable standard temperature in Table 4 within the limits 
of 7.2.4.2 and 7.2.4.3. When subsize specimens are used, the 
impact energy values obtained shall conform to Table 5 at 
energy values proportional to standard size. Exceptions to this 
requirement are permissible when Supplementary Requirement 
S 1 is specified by the purchaser. Impact tests may be made at 
temperatures different from those in Table 4, provided that the

NOTE 2 (page 521)
NoTE 2-As an example, the purchase order or contract requires an 
L-g:rade bolt to have an average 15 ft-lbs at -50 °F. If the Charpy V-notch 
testing indicates that the bolting material passes at -100 °F and if it also 
meets other mechanical property or other environmental resistance 
requirements, it is permissible or suitable for use if that specified 
temperature reflects the rninimum anticipated temperature range to which 
that the product or application will be subjected. 
6.2.2 Number of Tests: 
6.2.2.1 The test requirements for heat-treated bars are given 
in 6.1.2.1. 
6.2.2.2 For test requirements on studs, bolts, screws, etc., 
see 6.1.2.2. 
6.2.2.3 Impact tests are not required to be made on heat­
treated bars, bolts, screws, studs, and stud bolts ½ in. [12.5 
mm] and under in diameter. 
469 
6.2.3 Test Specimens-For sections 1 in. [25 mm] or less in 
diameter, test specimens shall be taken at the axis; for sections 
over 1 in. [25 mm] in diameter, midway between the axis and 
the surface. 
6.3 Hardness Requirements: 
6.3.1 The hardness shall conform to the requirements pre­
scribed in Table 1. Hardness testing shall be performed in 
accordance with either Specification A962/A962M or with Test 
Methods F606/F606M. 
6.3.2 The maximum hardness of Grade L7M shall be 235 
HBW or 99 HRB. Minimum hardness shall not be less than 200 
HBW or 93 HRB. Conformance to this hardness shall be 
ensured by testing each bolt or stud by Brinell or Rockwell B 
methods in accordance with 6.3.1. 
6.3.2.1 The use of 100 % electromagnetic testing for hard­
ness as an alternative to 100 % indentation hardness testing is 
permissible when qualified by sampling using indentation 
hardness testing. Each lot tested for hardness electromagneti­
cally shall be 100 % examined in accordance with Practice 
E566. Following electromagnetic testing for hardness, a ran­
dom sample of a minimum of 100 pieces in each purchase lot 
(as defined in 6.1.2.2) shall be tested by indentation hardness 
methods. All samples must meet hardness requirements to 
permit acceptance of the lot. If any one sample is outside of the 
specified maximum or minimum hardness, the lot shall be 
rejected and either reprocessed and resampled, or tested 100 % 
by indentation hardness methods. 
6.3.2.2 In the event a controversy exists relative to mini­
mum strength, tension tests shall prevail over hardness read­
ings. Products which have been tested and found acceptable 
shall have a line under the grade symbol.
