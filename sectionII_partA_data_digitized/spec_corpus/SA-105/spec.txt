SA-105 /SA-105M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Carbon Steel Forgings for Piping Applications 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers forged carbon steel piping 
components for ambient- and higher-temperature service in 
pressure systems. Included are flanges, fittings, valves, and 
similar parts ordered either to dimensions specified by the 
purchaser or to dimensional standards such as the MSS, 
ASME, and API specifications referenced in Section 2. Forg­
ings made to this specification are limited to a maximum 
weight of 10 000 lb [ 4540 kg]. Larger forgings may be ordered 
to Specification A266/A266M. Tubesheets and hollow cylin­
drical forgings for pressure vessel shells are not included 
within the scope of this specification. Although this specifica­
tion covers some piping components machined from rolled bar 
and seamless tubular products (see 5.2), it does not cover raw 
material produced in these product forms. 
1.2 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when 
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply 
only when specified individually by the purchaser in the order. 
1.3 Specification A266/ A266M covers other steel forgings 
and Specifications A675/A675M and A696 cover other steel 
bars. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and SI units. However, unless the order specifies the applicable 
"M" specification designation (SI units), the material shall be 
furnished to inch-pound units. The values stated in either SI 
units or inch-pound units are to be regarded separately as 
standard. Within the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. 
The values stated in each system may not be exact equivalents; 
therefore, each system shall be used independently of the other. 
Combining values from the two systems may result in non­
conformance with the standard. 
Norn 1-Toe dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

between two values shown above, the minimum elongation value is determined by 
the following equation:

where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm, %, and 
T = actual thickness of specimen, in. 
this positioning, the test specimen shall be positioned as near as 
possible to the prescribed location. 
8.3 Tension Tests: 
8.3.1 One tension test shall be made for each heat of 
as-forged components. 
8.3.2 One tension test shall be made from each heat-treating 
charge. If more than one heat is included in such a charge, each 
heat shall be tested. 
8.3.2.1 When forgings of different shapes are included in the 
same heat-treating charge, the test specimen shall be obtained 
from the heaviest cross-section of the thickest forging, except 
for hubbed flanges (see 8.3.3). The test specimen shall repre­
sent all forgings from the same heat and heat-treating charge 
whose maximum thicknesses do not exceed the thickness of the 
test forging. 
8.3.2.2 When the heat-treating temperatures are the same 
and the furnaces (either batch or continuous type), are con­
trolled within ±25 °F [±14 °C] and equipped with recording 
pyrometers so that complete records of heat treatment are 
available, then one tension test from each heat is required 
instead of one test from each heat in each heat-treatment 
charge. The test specimen material shall be included with a 
furnace charge. 
8.3.3 Testing shall be performed as specified in Specifica­
tion A961/A961M. The largest feasible round specimen shall 
be used except when hollow cylindrically shaped parts are 
machined from seamless tubulars, When hollow cylindrically 
shaped parts are machined from seamless tubular materials, 
strip tests may be used. The tension test specimen shall be 
obtained from a production forging, or from an integral 
prolongation representative of the hub location of a flange, or 
the heaviest cross section of a fitting, valve, or other part within 
the scope of this specification. 
8.3.4 Forgings too small to permit obtaining a subsize 
specimen of 0.250 in. [6.35 mm] diameter or larger parallel to 
the dimension of maximum working, and produced in equip­
ment unsuitable for the production of a separately forged test 
bar such as an automatic or semi-automatic press, may be 
accepted on the basis of hardness only. One percent of the 
forgings per lot, where a lot is the product from a heat, or, if 
heat treated, the product of a heat per furnace charge, or ten 
forgings, whichever is the lesser number, shall be selected at 
random, prepared, and tested using the standard Brinell test. 
The locations of the indentations shall be at the option of the 
manufacturer but shall be selected to be representative of the 
forging as a whole. One indentation per forging shall be 
required but additional indentations may be made to establish 
the representative hardness. The hardness of all forgings so 
tested shall be 137 to 197 HBW inclusive. 
8.4 Hardness Tests: 
8.4.1 Two hardness tests shall be made for each heat of 
as-forged components. When more than one forging is pro­
duced from each heat, a minimum of two forgings shall be 
tested with one reading from each forging. When only one 
forging is produced, it shall be tested in two locations. 
8.4.2 Except when only one forging is produced, a mini­
mum of two forgings shall be hardness tested per batch or 
continuous run as defined in 8.3.2.2 to ensure that forgings are 
within the hardness limits given in Table 2. When only one 
forging is produced, it shall be hardness tested in two locations 
to ensure it is within the hardness limits given in Table 2. 
166 
8.4.3 Testing shall be as specified in Specification A961/ 
A961M. The purchaser may verify that the requirement has 
been met by testing at any location on the forging, provided 
such testing does not render the forging useless. 
9. Hydrostatic Tests 
9.1 Such tests shall be conducted by the forging manufac­
turer only when Supplementary Requirement S57 in Specifi­
cation A961/A961M is specified. 
10. Retreatment 
10.1 If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform to 
the requirement specified, the manufacturer may heat treat or 
reheat treat the forgings as applicable and repeat the test 
specified in Section 8.

11. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion 
Protection 
11.1 The requirements of Specification A961/A961M apply 
to forgings and finished parts. 
12. Repair by Welding 
12.l Repair of defects by the manufacturer is permissible 
for forgings made to dimensional standards such as those of 
ASME or for other parts made for stock; by the manufacturer. 
Prior approval of the purchaser is required to repair-weld 
special forgings made to the purchaser's requirements. 
12.2 Weld repairs shall be made by a process that does not 
produce undesirably high levels of hydrogen in the welded 
areas. 
12.3 All forgings repaired by welding shall be post-weld 
heat treated between 1100 °F [593 °C] and the lower transfor­
mation temperature for a minimum of ½ h/in. [½ h/25.4 mm] 
of maximum section thickness, or alternatively annealed, 
normalized and tempered, or quenched and tempered. If the 
forging was not previously heat treated, the original tempering 
temperature was exceeded, or the forging was fully heat treated 
in the post weld cycle, then the forging shall be tested in 
accordance with Section 8 on completion of the cycle. 
12.4 The mechanical properties of the procedure­
qualification weldment shall, when tested in accordance with 
Section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
conform with the requirements listed in Table 2 for the thermal 
condition of repair-welded forgings. 
13. Rejection and Rehearing 
13.1 Each forging that develops mJunous defects during 
shop working or application shall be rejected and the manu­
facturer notified. 
14. Certification 
14.1 Identification Marking-For forgings made to specified 
dimensions, when agreed upon by the purchaser, and for 
forgings made to dimensional standards, application of identi­
fication marks as required in Specification A961/A961M shall 
be the certification that the forgings have been furnished in 
accordance with the requirements of this specification. 
14.2 Test Reports-The manufacturer shall also provide the 
following, where applicable: 
14.2.1 Type heat treatment, Section 6, 
14.2.2 Tensile property results, Section 8 (Table 2), report 
the yield strength and tensile strength, in ksi [MPa], elongation 
and reduction in area, in percent; and, if longitudinal strip 
tension specimens are used, report the width of the gauge 
length, 
14.2.3 Chemical analysis results, Section 7 (Table 1), re­
ported results shall be to the same number of significant figures 
as the limits specified in Table 1 for that element. 
14.2.4 Hardness results, Section 8 (Table 2), a minimum of 
two readings, and 
14.2.5 Any supplementary testing required by the purchase 
order. 
15. Product Marking 
15.1 In addition to marking requirements of Specification 
A961/A961M, the following additional marking requirements 
shall apply: 
15.1.1 If the forgings have been quenched and tempered, the 
letters "QT" shall be stamped on the forgings following this 
specification number. 
15.1.2 Forgings repaired by welding shall be marked with 
the letter "W" following this specification number. 
15.1.3 Plugs and bushings furnished to ASME B16.11 
requirements are not required to be marked. Other parts 
ordered with no marking are by agreement between the 
purchaser and manufacturer. 
15.1.4 When agreed upon between the purchaser and manu­
facturer and specified in the order, the markings shall be 
painted or stenciled on the fitting or stamped on a metal or 
plastic tag which shall be securely attached to the fitting. 
15.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 
Specification A961/A961M, bar coding is acceptable as a 
supplemental identification method. The purchaser may 
specify in the order a specific bar coding system to be used. 
The bar coding system, if applied at the discretion of the 
supplier, should be consistent with one of the published 
industry standards for bar coding. If used on small parts, the 
bar code may be applied to the box or a substantially applied 
tag.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the 
inquiry, contract, and order. 
Sl. Hardness 
S 1.1 The purchaser may check the hardness of any or all 
forgings supplied at any location on the forging and the 
hardness shall be 137 to 197 HBW. All forgings not within the 
specified hardness range shall be rejected. 
S2. Heat Treatment 
S2.1 All forgings shall be heat treated as specified by the 
purchaser. 
S2.2 When forgings not requiring heat treatment by 6.1 are 
supplied heat treated by purchaser request, the basis for 
determining conformance with Table 2 and Table 3 shall be 
hardness testing per 8.4 and either (J) tensile testing of heat 
treated forgings per 8.2, or (2) tensile tests from as-forged 
forgings or separately forged test blanks, as agreed upon 
between the supplier and purchaser. 
S2.3 When test reports are required, and tensile test results 
were obtained from as-forged forgings or as-forged test blanks, 
it shall be so indicated on the test report. 
S2.4 fu addition to the marking required by Section 15, this 
specification shall be followed by the letter: A for annealed, N 
for normalized, NT for normalized and tempered, or QT for 
quenched and tempered, as appropriate. 
168 
S3. Marking Small Forgings 
S3.1 For small products where the space for marking is less 
than 1 in. [25 mm] in any direction, test reports are mandat01y 
and marking may be restricted to only such symbols or codes 
as are necessary to identify the parts with test reports. 
S3.2 When the configuration or size does not permit mark­
ing directly on the forging, the marking method shall be a 
matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the pur­
chaser. 
S4. Carbon Equivalent 
S4.1 The maximum carbon equivalent, based on heat 
analysis, shall be 0.47 for forgings with a maximum section 
thickness of 2 in. or less, and 0.48 for forgings with a 
maximum section thickness of greater than 2 in. 
S4.2 Determine the carbon equivalent (CE) as follows: 
CE= C + Mn/6 + ( Cr+ Mo+ V)/5+ (Ni+ Cu)/15 
S4.3 A lower maximum carbon equivalent may be agreed 
upon between the supplier and the purchaser.
