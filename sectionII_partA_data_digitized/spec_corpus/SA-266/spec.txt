SA-268/SA-268M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Seamless and Welded Ferritic and Martensitic Stainless 
Steel Tubing for General Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers a number of grades of 
nominal-wall-thickness, stainless steel tubing for general 
corrosion-resisting and high-temperature service. Most of these 
grades are commonly known as the "straight-chromium" types 
and are characterized by being ferromagnetic. Two of these 
grades, TP410 and UNS S 41500 (Table 1), are amenable to 
hardening by heat treatment, and the high-chromium, ferritic 
alloys are sensitive to notch-brittleness on slow cooling to 
ordinary temperatures. These features should be recognized in 
the use of these materials. 
1.2 An optional supplementary requirement is provided, and 
when desired, shall be so stated in the order. 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Terminology 
3.l Lot Definitions: 
3.1.1 For flange and flaring requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes, prior to cutting, of the same nominal size 
and wall thickness that are produced from the same heat of 
steel. If final heat treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot 
shall include only those tubes of the same size and from the 
same heat that are heat treated in the same furnace charge. If 
the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, the number 
of tubes of the same size and from the same heat in a lot shall 
be determined from the size of the tubes as given in Table 2. 
3 .1.2 For tensile and hardness test requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes, prior to cutting, of the same nominal 
diameter and wall thickness that are produced from the same 
heat of steel. If final heat treatment is in a batch-type furnace, 
a lot shall include only those tubes of the same size and the 
same heat that are heat treated in the same furnace charge. If 
the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, a lot shall

AWhen tubes as ordered require wall thicknesses¾ in. [19 mm] or over, or an inside diameter 60 % or less of the outside diameter, a wider variation in wall thickness is 
required. On such sizes a variation in wall thickness of 12.5 % over or under will be permitted. 
For tubes less than½ in. [12.7 mm] in inside diameter which cannot be successfully drawn over a mandrel, the wall thickness may vary ±15 % from that specified. 
8 These tolerances apply to cut lengths up to and including 24 ft [7.3 m]. For lengths greater than 24 ft [7.3 m], the above over tolerances shall be increased by 1/a in. [3

1500 ft [450 m] of finished tubing. 
15. Intergranular Corrosion Test 
15.1 If intergranular corrosion testing is specified in the 
purchase order, the test shall be made in accordance with 
Practices A763, using samples prepared as agreed upon be­
tween the seller and the purchaser. 
16. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
16.1 Each tube, seamless or welded, shall be subjected to 
the nondestructive electric test or the hydrostatic test. The type 
of test to be used shall be at the option of the manufacturer, 
unless otherwise specified in the purchase order.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the 
inquiry, contract, or order. 
S1. Pneumatic Test 
S 1.1 The tubing shall be examined by a pneumatic test 
(either air under water or pneumatic leak test) in accordance 
with Specification A1016/A1016M. 
S2. Additional Testing of Welded Tubing for 100 % Joint 
Efficiency in Certain ASME Applications (see Note 
S2.1) 
NoTE S2.1-When specified, the special testing in this supplement is 
intended for special ASME applications. It is not mandatory for all ASME 
applications. 
S2.1 Where this supplement is specified in the purchase 
order, in certain ASME applications it is permissible to use 
100 % joint efficiency for the longitudinal weld, provided the 
following additional requirements are met: 
406 
S2.l.1 Each tube shall be subjected to an ultrasonic inspec­
tion employing Practices E273 or E213 with the rejection 
criteria referenced in Specification A1016/A1016M. 
S2. l.2 If Practice E273 is employed, a 100 % volumetric 
inspection of the entire length of each tube shall also be 
performed using one of the non-destructive electric tests 
permitted by Specification A1016/A1016M. 
S2. l .3 The test methods described in the supplement may 
not be capable of inspecting the end portions of tubes. This 
condition is referred to as end effect. This portion, as deter­
mined by the manufacturer, shall be removed and discarded. 
S2. l.4 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A1016/A1016M," S2" shall be added after the grade designa­
tion.
