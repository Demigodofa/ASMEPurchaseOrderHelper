to the axial length of the fitting. Elbows, return bends, tees and 
header tees shall not be machined directly from bar stock. 
6.3 Fittings, after forming at an elevated temperature, shall 
be cooled to a temperature below the critical range under 
suitable conditions to prevent injury by cooling too rapidly. 
6.4 All classes of fittings shall have the welders, welding 
operators, and welding procedures qualified under the provi­
sion of Section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code except that welds from the original pipe manufacturer 
made without the addition of filler metal do not require such 
qualification. 
7. Heat Treatment 
7 .1 Fittings requiring heat treatment shall be treated as 
specified in the individual product specification using the 
following procedures: 
7 .1.1 Annealing-Fittings shall be uniformly reheated to a 
temperature above the transformation range and, after holding 
for a sufficient time at this temperature, cooled slowly to a 
temperature below the transformation range. 
7.1.2 Solution Annealing (or Solution Treat or Treatment)­
Fittings shall be heated to a temperature that causes the 
carbides to go into solution and then quenched in water or 
rapidly cooled by other means to prevent reprecipitation. 
7.1.3 Isothermal Annealing-Isothermal annealing shall 
consist of austenitizing a ferrous alloy and then cooling to and 
holding within the range of temperature at which the austenite 
transforms to a relatively soft ferrite-carbide aggregate. 
7 .1.4 Normalizing-Fittings shall be uniformly reheated to a 
temperature above the transformation range and subsequently 
cooled in air at room temperature. 
7.1.5 Tempering and Post-Weld Heat Treatment-Fittings 
shall be reheated to the prescribed temperature below the 
transformation range, held at temperature for the greater of ½ 
h or 1 h/in. [25.4 mm] of thickness at the thickest section and 
cooled in still air. 
7.1.6 Stress Relieving-Fittings shall be uniformly heated to 
the selected stress relieving temperature, held long enough to 
reduce stresses and then cooled at a rate that will result in the 
properties required for the material grade and minimize the 
development of new residual stresses. The temperature shall 
not vary from the selected temperature by more than ± 25 °F 
[± 14 °C]. 
7.1.7 Quench and Temper-Fittings shall be fully austen­
itized and immediately quenched in a suitable liquid medium. 
The quenched fittings shall be reheated to a minimum tempera­
ture of 1100 °F [590 °C] and cooled in still air. 
8. Chemical Requirements 
8.1 Chemical Analysis-Samples for chemical analysis and 
methods of analysis shall be in accordance with Test Methods, 
Practices and Terminology A751 for Chemical Analysis of 
Steel Products. 
8.2 Heat Analysis-An analysis of each heat of steel shall be 
made by the manufacturer to determine the percentages of 
those elements specified in the individual product specification. 
If secondary melting processes are employed, the heat analysis 
shall be obtained from one remelted ingot of each primary 
melt. The chemical analysis thus determined shall conform to 
the requirements of the individual product specification. Note 
that the product analysis (check analysis) tolerances are not to 
be applied to the heat analysis requirements. 
8.2.1 For steels ordered under product specifications refer­
encing this specification of general requirements, the steel shall 
not contain an unspecified element, other than nitrogen for 
stainless steels, for the ordered grade to the extent that the steel 
conforms to the requirements of another grade for which that 
element is a specified element having a required minimum 
content. For this requirement, a grade is defined as an alloy 
described individually and identified by its own UNS or grade 
designation in a table of chemical requirements within any 
specification listed within the scope as being covered by this 
specification. 
8.3 Product Analysis-If a product analysis is performed it 
shall be in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, and 
Terminology A751. The chemical composition thus determined 
shall conform to limits of the product specification, within the 
permissible variations of Table 1 of this specification. 
8.3.1 Limits on formula calculations involving elemental 
contents shall apply only to the heat analysis, unless agreed 
upon between supplier and purchaser. Where limits on formula 
calculations involving elemental contents apply to product 
analysis by such agreement, permissible variations in the 
formula calculation results beyond the limits for the heat 
analysis shall also be agreed upon between supplier and 
purchaser. Examples of such formula calculations include, but 
are not limited to, the following: carbon equivalent CE = C + 
Mn/6 + (Cr + Mo + V) / 5 + (Ni + Cu) / 15; J factor= (Mn + 
Si) x (P + Sn) x 104; or requirements for specific elemental 
balance or sufficiency, typically related to Ti, Nb, or Al and 
interstitials C and N, such as Nb = 5 x C minimum. 
9. Mechanical Requirements 
9.I Method of Mechanical Test-All tests shall be con­
ducted in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370 
if the inch-pound units are specified or Test Methods A1058 if 
the M suffix (SI Units) standard is specified. 
9.2 The test specimen shall represent all material from the 
same heat and heat treatment load whose maximum thick­
nesses do not exceed the thickness of the test specimen or 
blank by more than ¼ in. [6 mm]. 
9.3 One tension test at room temperature shall be made in 
accordance with 9.2 from each heat in each heat treatment load. 
9.3.1 If heat treatment is performed in either a continuous or 
batch type furnace controlled within ± 25 °F [ ± 14 °C] of the 
required heat treatment temperature and equipped with record­
ing pyrometers so that complete records of heat treatment are 
available, and if the same heat treating cycles are used on the 
material represented by the tension test, then one tension test 
from each heat shall be required, instead of one tension test 
from each heat in each heat treatment load in accordance with 
9.2. 
9.4 Retest-When a retest is permitted by the product 
specification, it shall be performed on twice the number of 
representative specimens that were originally nonconforming.

SA-960/SA-960M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
shall be used unless the material to be tested is of insufficient 
thickness, in which case the largest obtainable standard subsize 
impact specimens shall be used. When the size or shape of the 
finished fittings is insufficient to permit obtaining the smallest 
standard subsize impact specimens, an impact test by the fitting 
manufacturer will not be required. 
13. Hydrostatic Test Requirements 
13 .1 Parts manufactured under this specification shall be 
capable of passing a hydrostatic test compatible with the rating 
of the specified matching pipe of equivalent material. Such a 
test shall be conducted only when specified in the purchase 
order or when the hydrostatic test Supplementary Requirement 
is invoked by the purchaser. 
14. Rework 
14.1 When one or more representative test specimens or 
retest specimens do not conform to the requirements specified 
in the product specification for the tested characteristic, the lot 
of material represented by the test specimen may be reworked 
according to the following requirements. 
14.1.1 If previously tested in the untreated condition, the 
product may be reworked by heat treatment, and subsequently 
retested, in accordance with the product specification. 
14.1.2 If previously tested in the heat treated condition, the 
product may be reworked by reheat treatment, and subse­
quently retested, in accordance with the product specification. 
15. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion 
Protection 
15.1 The parts shall conform to the dimensions, tolerances 
and finish as specified in the purchaser's order and to the 
individual ASTM product specification. 
15.2 The finished parts shall be cleaned to remove all scale 
and processing compounds prior to the final surface examina­

15.2.3 Protective coatings on parts subsequently subjected 
to socket welds or butt welds shall be suitable for welding 
without removal of the coating. Threaded fittings shall be 
capable of installation without the removal of the coating. 
15.2.4 When specified in the purchase order, parts may be 
furnished in the as-formed condition. 
15.3 Fittings supplied under this specification shall be 
examined visually. Selected typical surface discontinuities 
shall be explored for depth. Unless otherwise specified in the 
purchase order, the following shall apply. 
15.3.1 Fittings conforming to ASME B16.9, MSS-SP-43, 
and MSS-SP-95 shall be free of surface discontinuities that 
penetrate more than 5 % of the specified nominal wall 
thickness, except as defined in 15.3.3 and 15.3.4. Fittings 
conforming to ASME B16.11, MSS-SP-79, MSS-SP-83, and 
MSS-SP-97 shall be free of surface discontinuities that pen­
etrate more than 5 % of the actual wall thickness at the point of 
interest, or 1/16 in. [1.6 mm], whichever is less, except as 
defined in 15.3.4. Fittings conforming to MSS-SP-75 shall be 
free of surface discontinuities that penetrate more than 6½ % 
of the specified nominal wall thickness. 
15.3.2 Surface discontinuities deeper than 5 % of the speci­
fied nominal or actual wall thickness as applicable, except as 
defined in 15.3.3 and 15.3.4, shall be removed by the manu­
facturer by machining or grinding to sound metal, and the 
repaired areas shall blend smoothly into the contour of the 
finished fitting. Surface discontinuities on fittings conforming 
to MSS-SP- 75 shall be removed or repaired in accordance with 
the requirements of that standard. Except for fittings conform­
ing to MSS-SP-75, the wall thickness at all points shall be at 
least the specified minimum wall thickness, or 87½ % of the 
specified nominal wall thickness and the diameters shall be 
within the limits specified in the applicable dimensional 
standards. 
15.3.3 Surface checks (fish scale) deeper than 1/64 in. [0.4 
mm] shall be removed. 
15.3.4 Mechanical marks deeper than 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] shall 
be removed. 
15.3.5 When the removal of a surface discontinuity reduces 
the wall thickness below the specified minimum wall thickness 
at any point, the fitting shall be subject to rejection or to repair 
as provided in Section 16, or in accordance with MSS-SP- 75 
for fittings conforming to that standard. 
16. Repair by Welding 
16.1 The purchaser may require the supplier to submit 
proposed weld repairs for approval by invoking the appropriate 
Supplementary Requirement in the purchase order. 
16.2 If the purchaser does not require prior approval of the 
proposed weld repairs, these repairs shall be permitted at the 
discretion of the supplier. All weld repairs shall be performed 
in accordance with the following limitations and requirements. 
16.2.1 The welding procedure, welders and operators shall 
be qualified in accordance with Section IX of the ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code. The composition of the weld deposit 
shall be compatible with the composition of the material being 
welded. 
16.2.2 Defects shall be completely removed prior to weld­
ing by machining, chipping or grinding to sound metal. 
Removal of these defects shall be verified by magnetic particle 
examination in accordance with Guide E709 or liquid penetrant 
inspection in accordance with Test Method E165/E165M, as 
applicable. 
16.2.3 After repair welding, the welded area shall be ma­
chined or ground smooth to the original contour and shall be 
completely free of defects as verified by magnetic particle 
1394

requirements, if any, invoked in the product specification. 
17. Inspection 
17 .1 The supplier shall provide the purchaser's inspector 
with all reasonable facilities necessary to satisfy him that the 
material is being produced and furnished in accordance with 
this specification and the applicable product specification. Site 
inspection by the purchaser shall not interfere unnecessarily 
with the supplier's operations. 
18. Rejection and Rehearing 
18.1 Samples representing material rejected by the pur­
chaser shall be preserved until disposition of the claim has been 
agreed to between the supplier and the purchaser. 
19. Marking 
19.l Each piece shall be legibly marked in a position as not 
to injure the usefulness of the fitting with the product specifi­
cation number, grade or marking symbol, class, certifying 
organization's name or symbol, the heat number or heat 
identification, size, and schedule number or wall thickness, if 
applicable. Dual or multiple marking with the product speci­
fication number, grade or marking symbol, and class is 
acceptable provided the material meets all the requirements 
with which it is marked. It is not required to mark the product 
with the specification year and date of issue. When size or 
shape does not permit the inclusion of all the required marking 
as described, see 19.2. Manufacturer can also choose the use of 
tags, box labels, etc. for identification when per piece marking 
is not practical due to size or shape. 
19.2 The Standard Marking System of Valves, Fittings, 
Flanges and Unions MSS-SP-25 shall be followed except the 
word "steel" shall not be substituted for the specification grade. 
19.3 Product marking shall conform to the additional 
requirements, if any, invoked in the product specification or 
purchase order. 
20. Certification 
20.1 A test report and certificate of compliance are required. 
20.2 Test reports shall include the product specification 
number and year/date of issue, the results of all tests required 
by this specification, and the purchaser order, and shall be 
traceable to the part represented. 
20.3 A single document containing the test report informa­
tion and certificate of compliance information may be used. 
20.4 A certificate printed from or used in electronic data 
interchange (EDI) transmission shall be regarded as having the 
same validity as a counterpart printed in the certifier's facility. 
The content of the EDI transmitted document shall conform to 
any existing EDI agreement between the purchaser and the 
supplier. 
20.5 Not withstanding the absence of a signature, the 
organization submitting either a printed certificate or an EDI 
transmitted certificate is responsible for the content of the 
report. 
21. Packaging, Marking and Loading for Shipment 
21.1 Packaging, marking, and loading for shipment shall be 
in accordance with Practices A 700. 
22. Keywords 
22.1 austenitic stainless steel; corrosive service applica­
tions; ferritic/austenitic stainless steel; ferritic stainless steel; 
high strength low alloy steel; martensitic stainless steel; piping 
applications; pressure containing parts; pressure vessel service; 
stainless steel fittings; temperature service applications­
elevated; temperature service applications-low; temperature 
service applications-moderate 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
These requirements shall not be considered unless specified in the order, in which event, the 
supplementary requirements specified shall be made at the place of manufacture, unless otherwise 
agreed upon, at the purchaser's expense. The test specified shall be witnessed by the purchaser's 
inspector before shipment of material, if so specified in the order. The rationale for beginning the 
section numbering with SS0 is to eliminate the possibility of confusion with supplementary 
requirements existing in individual product specifications. 
SSO. Product Analysis (See Note SSO.l) 
SS0.1 A product analysis shall be made from each heat of 
base metal and, if of welded construction, from each lot 
number of welding material of the fittings offered for delivery. 
The analysis shall conform to the requirements specified in 
Section 8. 
S51. Tension Test (See Note SS0.1) 
SS 1.1 One tension test shall be made on one fitting or 
representative test piece (See Note SS0.2) per lot (See Note 
SS0.3) of fittings. If the fittings are of welded construction, the 
tension specimen shall include the weld and shall be prepared 
so that the weld is at the midlength location of the specimen.

A836/A836M 
1.2 In case of conflict between a requirement of the indi­
vidual product specification and a requirement of this general 
requirement specification, the requirements of the individual 
product specification shall prevail over those of this specifica­
tion. 
1.3 By mutual agreement between the purchaser and the 
supplier, additional requirements may be specified (see Section 
4.1.2). The acceptance of any such additional requirements 
shall be dependent on negotiations with the supplier and must 
be included in the order as agreed upon between the purchaser 
and supplier. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text and 
the tables, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. The inch-pound units shall apply, unless the 
"M" designation (SI) of the product specification is specified in 
the order. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions-For definitions of other terms used in this 
specification, refer to Terminology A941. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.1 bar; n-a solid rolled or forged section that is long in 
relationship to its cross sectional dimensions, with a relatively 
constant cross section throughout its length and a wrought 
microstructure. 
3.2.2 certifying organization, n-the company or associa­
tion responsible for the conformance of, the marking of, and 
the certification of the product to the specification require­
ments. 
3.2.3 fitting, n-a component for non-bolted joints in piping 
systems. 
3.2.4 flange, n-a component for bolted joints used in 
piping systems. 
3.2.5 forging, n-the product of a substantially compressive 
hot or cold plastic working operation that consolidates the 
material and produces the required shape. 
3.2.5.1 Discussion-The plastic working must be performed 
by a forging machine, such as a hammer, press, or ring rolling 
machine, and must deform the material to produce a wrought 
structure throughout the material cross section. 
3.2.6 seamless tubing, n-a tubular product made without a 
welded seam. 
3.2.6.1 Discussion-It is manufactured usually by hot work­
ing the material, and if necessary, by subsequently cold 
finishing the hot worked tubular product to produce the desired 
shape, dimensions and properties. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order all ordering information necessary to purchase 
the needed material. Examples of such information include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity, 
4.1.2 Size and pressure class or dimensions, (tolerances and 
surface finishes should be included), 
4.1.3 Specification number with grade or class, or both, as 
applicable, and year/date, 
4.1.4 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test 
Methods A1058 when material is ordered to an M suffix (SI 
units) product standard. If the choice of test track is not 
specified in the order, then the default ASTM track shall be 
used as noted in Test Methods Al058, 
4.1.5 Supplementary requirements, and 
4.1.6 Additional requirements. 
S. Melting Process 
5.1 Unless otherwise specified in the individual Product 
Specification, the steel shall be fully killed. 
5.2 If a specific type of melting is required by the purchaser, 
it shall be stated on the purchase order. 
5.3 The primary melting may incorporate separate degas­
sing or refining and may be followed by secondary melting, 
such as electroslag remelting or vacuum remelting. If second­
ary melting is employed, the heat shall be defined as all of the 
ingot remelted from a single primary heat. 
5.4 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When 
steel of different grades is sequentially strand cast, identifica­
tion of the resultant transition material is required. The steel 
producer shall remove the transition material by an established 
procedure that positively separates the grades. 
5.5 A sufficient discard shall be made from the source 
material to secure freedom from injurious porosity and 
shrinkage, and undue segregation. 
6. Manufacture 
6.1 The finished part shall be manufactured from a forging 
that is as close as practicable to the finished size or shape. 
Alternative starting materials may be used, but with the 
following exceptions and requirements. 
1403

=== Page 1462 ===

SA-961/SA-961M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
6.1.1 Bar-Flanges, elbows, return bends, tees, and header 
tees shall not be machined directly from bar. Other cylindrical 
shaped parts up to, and including, NPS 4 can be machined from 
bar provided that the axial length of the part is approximately 
parallel to the metal flow lines of the starting stock. 
6.1.2 Wrought Seamless Pipe and Tubing-Flanges shall not 
be machined directly from seamless pipe or tubing. Other 
hollow cylindrical shaped parts can be machined from seam­
less pipe and tubing provided that the axial length of the pa.it 
is approximately parallel to the metal flow lines of the staiting 
stock. 
7. Heat Treatment 
7.1 Material requiring heat treatment shall be treated as 
specified in the individual product specification using the 
following procedures that are defined in more detail in Termi­
nology A94 l. 
7.1.1 Annealing-Material shall be uniformly reheated to a 
temperature above the transformation range and, after holding 
for a sufficient time at this temperature, cooled slowly to a 
temperature below the transformation range. 
7.1.2 Solution Annealing (or Solution Treat or Treatment)­
Material shall be heated to a temperature that causes the 
chromium cai·bides to go into solution, and then, quenched in 
water or rapidly cooled by other means to prevent re­
precipitation. 
7.1.3 Isothermal Annealing-Isothermal annealing shall 
consist of austenitizing a ferrous alloy, and then, cooling to and 
holding within the range of temperature at which the austenite 
transfonns to a relatively soft ferrite-carbide aggregate. 
7.1.4 Normalizing-Material shall be uniformly reheated to 
a temperature above the transformation range, and 
subsequently, cooled in air at room temperature. 
7.1.5 Tempering and Post-Weld Heat Treatment-Material 
shall be reheated to the prescribed temperature below the 
transformation range, held at temperature for the greater of 30 
min or 1 h/in. [25 .4 mm] of thickness at the thickest section and 
cooled in still air. 
7.1.6 Stress Relieving-Material shall be uniformly heated 
to the selected stress relieving temperature, held long enough 
to reduce stresses and then cooled at a rate that will result in the 
properties required for the material grade and minimize the 
development of new residual stresses. The temperature shall 
not vary from the selected temperature by more than :±: 25 °F 
[:±:14 °C]. 
7.1.7 Quench and Temper-Material shall be fully austen­
itized and quenched immediately in a suitable liquid medium. 
The quenched material shall be reheated to a minimum 
temperature of 1100 °F [590 °C] and cooled in still air. 
7.1.8 Same Heat Treat Cycle-Heat treat loads at the same 
temperature, equivalent soak times as appropriate for the 
maximum section size on the respective load and equivalent 
cooling methods. 
8. Chemical Requirements 
8.1 Chemical Analysis-Samples for chemical analysis and 
methods of analysis shall be in accordance with Test Methods, 
Practices, and Terminology A 751. 
8.2 Heat Analysis-An analysis of each heat of steel shall be 
made by the steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of 
those elements specified in the individual product specification. 
If secondary melting processes are employed, the heat analysis 
shall be obtained from one remelted ingot, or the product of 
one remelted ingot, from each primary melt. The chemical 
analysis thus determined shall conform to the requirements of 
the individual product specification. Note that the product 
analysis (check analysis) tolerances are not to be applied to the 
Heat Analysis requirements. 
8.3 Product Analysis-If a product analysis is performed it 
shall be in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, and 
Terminology A751. Sainples for analysis shall be taken from 
midway between center and surface of solid parts, midway 
between inner and outer surfaces of hollow parts, midway 
between center and surface of full-size prolongations or from 
broken mechanical test specimens. The chemical composition 
thus determined shall conform to the limits of the product 
specification, within the permissible variations of Table 1 of 
this specification. 
8.3.1 Limits on formula calculations involving elemental 
contents shall apply only to the heat analysis, unless agreed 
upon between supplier and purchaser. Where limits on formula 
calculations involving elemental contents apply to product 
analysis by such agreement, permissible variations in the 
formula calculation results beyond the limits for the heat 
analysis shall also be agreed upon between supplier and 
purchaser. Examples of such formula calculations include, but 
are not limited to, the following: carbon equivalent CE = C + 
Mn/ 6 + (Cr+ Mo + V) / 5 + (Ni + Cu) / 15; J factor= (Mn 
+ Si) x (P + Sn) x 104; or requirements for specific elemental 
balance or sufficiency, typically related to Ti, Nb, or Al and 
interstitials C and N, such as Nb = 5 x C minimum. 
9. Mechanical Requirements 
9.l Method of Mechanical Tests-All tests shall be con­
ducted in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370 
if the inch-pound units are specified or Test Methods A1058 if 
the M suffix (SI units) is specified. 
9.2 For the purpose of determining conformance to the 
product specification requirements, specimens shall be ob­
tained from the production forgings, or from separately forged 
test blanks prepared from the stock used to make the finished 
product. In either case, mechanical test specimens shall not be 
removed until after all heat treatment is complete. If repair 
welding is performed, test specimens shall not be removed 
until after post-weld heat treatment is complete, unless permit­
ted by the product specification. The locations from which test 
specimens are removed shall be in accordance with the Product 
Specification. 
9.3 If separately forged test blanks are used, they shall be of 
the saine heat of steel, be subjected to substantially the same 
reduction and working as the production forging they 
represent, be heat treated in the same furnace charge except as 
provided for in the reduced testing provisions of the product 
specification, under the same conditions as the production 
forging, and be of the saine nominal thickness as the maximum 
heat treated thickness of the production forging.

°No over tolerance allowed. 
9.4 When parts are machined from bar or seamless tubing, 
as permitted in 6.1.1 and 6.1.2, the mechanical properties may 
be determined for the parts from the starting material, if the 
parts have not been subjected to any subsequent thermal 
processing since the time of mechanical test. 
10. Hardness Requirements 
10.1 The part shall conform to the hardness requirements 
prescribed in the product specification. 
10.2 Sampling for hardness testing shall conform to the 
product specification. 
11. Tensile Requirements 
11.1 Sampling for tensile testing shall conform to the 
Product Specification. 
11.2 When the dimensions of the material to be tes_ted will 
permit, the tension test specimens shall be machined to 
standard round 2-in. gauge length tension test specimen de­
scribed in Test Methods and Definitions A370 if inch-pound 
units are specified or the standard gauge length tension test 
specimens described in the applicable track of Test Methods 
A1058 if SI units are specified. 
11.3 In the case of small sections, which will not permit 
taking of the standard test specimen described in 11.2, the 
subsize round specimen shall be machined. The tension test 
specimen shall be as large as feasible. 
11.4 The results of the tensile tests shall conform to the 
tensile property requirements prescribed in the product speci­
fication. 
11.5 If the results of tension tests do not conform to the 
requirements specified in the product specification, a retest 
shall be permitted on twice the number of test specimens as 
originally tested as outlined in the test methods specified 
herein. When any retest. specimen does not conform to the 
product specification requirements for the characteristic in 
question, the lot represented by that specimen shall be rejected 
or reheat treated in accordance with Section 7. 
11.5.1 If the results of any tension test specimen are less 
than specified because a flaw becomes evident in the test 
specimen during testing, a replacement test specimen shall be 
allowed provided that the defect is not attributable to ruptures, 
cracks, or flakes in the steel. 
12. Impact Requirements 
12.1 The part shall conform to the impact requirements 
prescribed in the product specification. 
12.2 Sampling for impact testing shall conform to the 
Product Specification. 
12.3 Notched-bar impact specimens shall be simple-beam, 
Charpy-type A with a V-notch in accordance with Test Methods 
and Definitions A370 if the inch-pound units are specified or 
Test Methods A1058 if the M suffix (SI Units) standard is 
specified. Standard specimens 10 by 10 mm in cross section 
shall be used unless the material to be tested is of insufficient 
thickness, in which case the largest obtainable standard subsize 
impact specimens shall be used. When the size or shape of the 
1405

=== Page 1464 ===

SA-961/SA-961M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
:finished part is insufficient to permit obtaining the smallest 
standard subsize impact specimens, an impact test by the part 
manufacturer will not be required. 
12.4 If the average impact energy value meets the product 
specification requirements, but the energy value for one speci­
men is below the specified minimum value for individual 
specimens, a retest is permitted. This shall consist of two 
impact specimens from a location adjacent to, and on either 
side of, the specimen that failed. Each of the retested speci­
mens must exhibit an energy value equal to or greater than the 
minimum average value required by the product specification. 
13. Hydrostatic Test Requirements 
13.1 Parts manufactured under this specification shall be 
capable of passing a hydrostatic test compatible with the rating 
of the finished part. Such tests shall be conducted by the 
supplier only when the hydrostatic test supplementary require­
ment in the product specification is invoked by the purchaser. 
14. Re~ork 
14.1 When one or more representative test specimens or 
retest specimens do not conform to the requirements specified 
in the product specification for the tested characteristic, the 
product may be reworked according to the following require­
ments: 
14.1.1 If previously tested in the unheat treated condition, 
the product may be reworked by heat treatment, and subse­
quently retested, in accordance with the product specification. 
14.1.2 If previously tested in the heat treated condition, the 
product may be reworked by reheat treatment, and subse­
quently retested, in accordance with the product specification. 
15. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion 
Protection 
15.1 The parts shall conform to the dimensions, tolerances, 
and finish as specified on the purchaser's drawing or order and 
the individual ASTM product specification. 
15.2 The :finished parts shall be cleaned to remove all scale 
and processing compounds prior to the final surface examina­
tion. The cleaning process shall not injure the surface finish, 
material properties, or the metallurgical structure. 
15.2.1 The surface finish shall allow the detection of imper­
fections that can be disclosed by visual inspection. 
15.2.2 The cleaned parts shall be protected to prevent 
recontamination. 
15.2.2.1 Exterior and interior surfaces of carbon, low and 
intermediate alloy steel :fittings shall have a corrosion protec­
tive coating. Unless otherwise specified by the purchaser, the 
type of surface protection shall be at the option of the 
manufacturer. 
15.2.2.2 Stainless steel and nickel alloy :fittings need not be 
coated. Unmachined surfaces of stainless steel fittings shall be 
passivated by exposure to an acid bath, or electropolished. 
15.2.3 Protective coatings on parts subsequently subjected 
to socket welds or butt welds shall be suitable for welding 
without removal of the coating. Threaded :fittings shall be 
capable of installation without the removal of the coating. 
15.2.4 When specified in the purchase order, parts may be 
furnished in the as-formed or as-forged condition. 
15.3 The parts shall be free of injurious imperfections as 
defined below. At the discretion of the inspector representing 
the purchaser, finished parts shall be subject to rejection if 
surface imperfections acceptable under 15.5 are not scattered, 
but appear over a large area. 
15.4 Depth of Injurious Imperfections-Selected typical 
linear and other typical surface imperfections shall be explored 
for depth. When the depth encroaches on the minimum 
specified wall thickness of the finished part, such imperfections 
shall be considered injurious. • 
15.5 Imperfections Not Classified as Injurious-Surface 
imperfections not classified as injurious shall be treated as 
follows: 
15.5.1 Seams, laps, tears, or slivers not deeper than 5 % of 
the actual wall thickness at the point of interest or 1/16 in. [1.6 
mm], whichever is less, are acceptable. If deeper, these 
imperfections require removal, and shall be removed by 
machining or grinding. 
15.5.2 Mechanical marks or abrasions and pits shall be 
acceptable without grinding or machining provided the depth 
does not exceed 1/16 in. [1.6 mm]. If such imperfections are 
deeper than 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] but do not encroach on the 
minimum wall thickness of the forging they shall be removed 
by machining or grinding to sound metal. 
15.5.3 The wall thickness at the point of grinding, or at 
imperfections not required to be removed, shall be determined 
by deducting the amount removed by grinding, from the

value. 
16. Repair by Welding 
16.1 The purchaser may require the supplier to submit 
proposed weld repairs for approval by invoking the appropriate 
supplementary requirement from the applicable product speci­
fication in the purchase order. If the purchaser does not require 
prior approval of proposed weld repairs, these repairs shall be 
permitted at the discretion of the supplier. All weld repairs shall 
be performed in accordance with the following limitations and 
requirements. 
16.1.1 The welding procedure and welders shall be qualified 
in accordance with Section IX of the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code. 
16.1.2 Defects shall be completely removed prior to weld­
ing by chipping or grinding to sound metal. Removal of these 
defects shall be verified by magnetic particle inspection in 
accordance with Test Method A275/A275M or Guide E709 for 
the ferritic, martensitic, or ferritic/austenitic grades, or by 
liquid penetrant inspection in accordance with Test Method 
E165/E165M for ferritic, martensitic, or austenitic grades. 
16.1.3 After repair welding, the welded area shall be ground 
smooth to the original contour and shall be completely free of 
defects as verified by magnetic particle or liquid penetrant 
inspection, as applicable.

tion and certificate of compliance information may be used. 
19 .4 A certificate printed from or used in electronic data 
interchange (EDI) transmission shall be regarded as having the 
same validity as a counterpoint printed in the certifier's facility. 
The content of the EDI transmitted document shall conform to 
any existing EDI agreement between the purchaser and sup­
plier. 
19.5 Not withstanding the absence of a signature, the 
organization submitting either a printed certificate or an EDI 
transmitted certificate is responsible for the content of the 
report. 
20. Marking 
20.1 Each piece shall be legibly marked in a position as not 
to injure the usefulness of the forgings with the product 
specification number, grade or marking symbol, class, certify­

identification, size, and service rating, if applicable. Dual or 
multiple marking with the product specification number, grade 
or marking symbol, and class is acceptable provided the 
material meets all the requirements with which it is marked. It 
is not required to mark the product with the specification year 
and date of issue. When size or shape does not permit the 
inclusion of all the required marking as described, see 20.2. 
Manufacturer can also choose the use of tags, box labels, etc. 
for identification when per piece marking is not practical due to 
size or shape.

Specification for 
Common Requirements for Bolting Intended for Use at Any 
Temperature from Cryogenic to the Creep Range 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers a group of common require­
ments that shall apply to carbon, alloy, stainless steel, and 
nickel alloy bolting under any of the following ASTM Speci­
fications ( or under any other ASTM Specifications that invoke 
this specification or portions thereof): 
Title of Specifications ASTM Designation 
Alloy-Steel and Stainless Steel Bolting for A 193/ A 193M 
High Temperature or High Pressure Service and 
Other Special Purpose Applications 
Carbon Steel, Alloy Steel, and Stainless Steel Nuts A194/A194M

Applications 
1.2 In case of conflict, the requirements of the individual 
product specification shall prevail over those of this specifica­
tion. 
1.3 Fasteners are a wide-ranging classification that includes 
screws, bolts, nuts, washers, stud bolts, rivets, powder-actuated 
studs, staples, tacks, and pins. Bolting, which is composed of 
bolting materials, such as rods, bars, flats, and forgings, which 
are subsequently manufactured into bolting components, are a 
special sub-group of fasteners. Bolting materials and compo­
nents have designated compositions and specific properties 
intended for applications in aggressive service where commer­
cial generic fasteners may not be suitable or have insufficient 
fitness for purpose under certain conditions. These conditions 
include cryogenic or high temperature service, or excessive 
vibration, impact, or shock. To further address any other 
special service conditions where bolting is intended for use, 
additional requirements may be specified by mutual agreement 
between the purchaser and supplier. 
1.4 Supplementary requirements are provided for use at the 
option of the purchaser. The supplementary requirements only 
apply when specified individually by the purchaser in the 
purchase order or contract. 
1.5 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. Unless the purchase order or contract specifies 
the applicable "M" specification designation (SI units) the 
inch-pound units shall apply. The values stated in either SI 
units or inch-pound units are to be regarded separately as 
standard. Within the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. 
The values stated in each system may not be exact equivalents; 
therefore, each system shall be used independently of the other. 
Combining values from the two systems may result in noncon­
formance with the specification. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. 
2. Referenced Documents 
The following documents shall form a part of this specifica­
tion to the extent specified. The latest issue shall apply un­
less otherwise specified.

those elements specified in the individual product specification. 
If secondary melting processes are employed, the heat analysis 
shall be obtained from one remelted ingot or the product of one 
remelted ingot of each primary melt. The chemical analysis 
thus determined shall conform to the requirements of the 
individual product specification. Product analysis (check 
analysis) tolerances shall not be applied to heat analysis 
requirements. 
7.3 Product Analysis-When performed, by manufacturer,

composition thus determined shall conform to the limits of the 
product specification, within the permissible tolerances found 
in Tables 5 and 6 of Specification A29/A29M and Table 1 of 
Specification A484/A484M as appropriate for the grade being 
supplied. When multiple samples are taken from the same lot 
for product analysis, individual elements shall not vary both 
above and below the specified range.

tellurium shall not be supplied or used. Steels with intentional 
additions of selenium may only be supplied or used when 
specifically called out in the product specification. 
7.6 The starting material shall not contain any unspecified 
elements, other than nitrogen in austenitic stainless steels, for 
the ordered grade( s) to the extent that it then conforms to the 
requirements of another grade for which that element is a 
specified element having a required minimum content.

1.2 This specification also covers a group of supple­
mentary requirements, which may be applied to the above 
specifications as indicated therein. These requirements are 
provided for use when additional testing or inspection is 
desired and apply only when specified individually by the 
purchaser in the order. 
1.3 When investment casting is ordered, the require­
ments of this specification shall take precedence over the 
individual material specification requirements. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as the standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
must be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in nonconformance with 
this specification. Inch-pound units are applicable for mate­
rial ordered to Specification A 985 and SI units for material 
ordered to Specification A 985M. 
1.5 This standard does not purport to address all of 
the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is 
the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish 
appropriate safety and health practices and determine the 
applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions - The definitions in Test Methods and 
Definitions A 370 and Terminology A 941 are applicable 
to this specification and those listed in 1.1. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.1 heat, n - all the molten metal poured from a 
single furnace or all of the molten metal from two or more 
furnaces poured into a single ladle or casting prior to the 
replenishing of the furnace(s). 
3.2.2 investment casting, n - a metal casting that is 
produced in a mold obtained by investing (surrounding) 
an expendable pattern with a ceramic slurry, which is 
allowed to solidify. The expendable pattern may consist 
of wax, plastic, or other material and is removed prior to 
filling the mold with liquid metal. 
3.2.3 master heat, n - a single furnace charge of 
alloy that may be either poured directly into castings or 
into remelt alloy for individual melts. 
3.2.4 subheat, n - a portion of master heat remelted 
with only minor additions for deoxidation for pouring into 
castings. Syn. melt, production heat. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Melting Process - Master heats shall be made by 
the electric furnace process with or without separate refin­
ing such as argon-oxygen-decarburization (AOD), vac­
uum-oxygen-degassing (VOD), vacuum-induction­
melting (VIM), and so forth, unless otherwise specified in 
the individual specification or agreed upon between the 
customer and producer. Master heats may be used directly 
for producing castings or converted into ingot, bar, shot, 
or other suitable form, not including gates and risers from 
casting production, for later remelting as a subheat. 
4.2 Re-Melting Process - Subheats shall be produced 
from master heat metal in suitable batch sizes by electric 
induction furnace, with or without atmosphere protection, 
such as vacuum or inert gas unless otherwise agreed upon 
between the customer and producer. Revert (gates, sprues, 
risers, and rejected castings) shall not be remelted except 
in master heats. 
4.3 Heat Treatment: 
4.3.1 Ferritic and martensitic steel shall be cooled 
after pouring to provide substantially complete transforma­
tion of austenite prior to heat treatment to enhance mechani­
cal properties. 
4.3.2 Castings shall be heat treated in the working 
zone of a furnace that has been surveyed in accordance 
with Test Method A 991/A 991M. 
1435

SA-985/SA-985M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
4.3.2.1 When castings are heat treated at tempera­
tures above 2000°F [1100°C], then the working zone shall 
have been established by a survey performed at not more 
than 25°F [15°C] below nor more than 200°F [l10°C] 
above the minimum heat treatment temperature specified 
for the grade. If a minimum heat treatment temperature is 
not specified for the grade, then the survey temperature 
shall be not more than 50°F [30°C] below nor more than 
175°F [100°C] above the furnace set point used. 
4.3.2.2 The maximum variation in measured tem­
perature as determined by the difference between the high­
est temperature and the lowest temperature shall be as 
agreed between the purchaser and producer except that 
during production heat treatment no portion of the furnace 
shall be below the minimum specified temperature nor 
above the maximum specified temperature for the grade 
being processed. 
4.4 Sampling: 
4.4.1 If castings are poured directly from one or 
more master heats, then the samples for chemical and other 
required testing also shall be poured directly from each of 
the master heats. 
4.4.2 If castings are poured from a subheat, then the 
samples for chemical and other required testing also shall 
be poured from a subheat of that same master heat, but 
not necessarily from the same subheat as the castings. The 
subheat used for the test samples shall be produced using 
the same practices and additions as used for the castings. 
4.4.3 Test specimens may be taken from castings or 
from coupons cast either integrally with the castings, in 
the same molds as the castings, or in separate molds. 
4.4.4 Separately cast specimens for tension testing 
shall be cast in molds of the same type and material as 
those used for the castings, as shown in Figs. 1-4 and 
Table 2, except when Supplementary Requirement S26 is 
specified. The test coupon in Fig. 4 shall be employed 
only for austenitic alloy castings with cross sections less 
than 2½ in. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Chemical Analysis - Chemical analysis of materi­
als covered by this specification shall be in accordance 
with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A 751. 
5.2 Heat Analysis - An analysis of samples obtained 
in accordance with 4.4 or Supplementary Requirement S27 
as appropriate, shall be made by the manufacturer to deter­
mine the percentages of the elements specified for the grade 
being poured. When drillings are used, they shall be taken 
not less than ½ 6 in. [1.6 mm] beneath the surface. The 
chemical composition thus determined shall be reported to 
the purchaser, or his representative, and shall conform to 
the requirements in the individual specification for the 
grade being poured. 
5.3 Product Analysis - A product analysis may be 
made by the purchaser from material representing each 
master heat, subheat, lot, or casting. The analysis shall 
be made on representative material. Samples for carbon 
analysis shall be taken no closer than ½ 6 in. [1.6 mm] to 
a cast surface except that castings too thin for this shall 
be analyzed on representative material. The chemical com­
position thus determined shall meet the requirements speci­
fied in the applicable specification for the grade involved, 
or shall be subject to rejection by the purchaser, except 
that the chemical composition determined for carbon and 
low-alloy steel castings may vary from the specified limits 
by the amounts shown in Table 1. The product analysis 
tolerances of Table 1 are not applicable as acceptance 
criteria for heat analysis by the casting manufacturer. When 
comparing product and heat analysis for other than carbon 
and low alloy steels, the reproducibility data R2, in Test 
Methods E 353 or E 354, as applicable, shall be taken into 
consideration. 
5.4 Unspecified Elements - When chemical analysis 
for elements not specified for the grade ordered is desired, 
Supplementary Requirement S 1 may be specified. 
NOTE 1 - All commercial metals contain small amounts of various 
elements in addition to those which are specified. It is neither practical 
nor necessary to specify limits for every unspecified element that might 
be present, despite the fact that the presence of many of these elements 
often is determined routinely by the producer. 
5.5 The substitution of a grade or composition different 
from that specified by the purchaser is prohibited. 
6. Mechanical Test Methods 
6.1 All mechanical tests shall be conducted in accor­
dance with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
7. Tensile Requirements 
7.1 Sampling for tension testing shall be in accordance 
with 4.4 or with Supplementary Requirement S28 as appro­
priate. 
7.2 The coupon from which the test specimen is taken 
shall be heat treated in production furnaces to the same 
procedure as the castings it represents. 
7 .3 If any specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws, it may be discarded and another substituted 
from the same heat. 
7.4 To determine accordance with the tension test 
requirements, an observed value or calculated value shall 
be rounded off in accordance with Practice E 29 to the 
1436

=== Page 1495 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-985/SA-985M 
nearest 500 psi [51 MPa] for yield and tensile strength and 
to the nearest 1 % for elongation and reduction of area. 
8. Repair by Welding 
8.1 Repair by welding shall be in accordance with the 
requirements of individual specifications using procedures 
and welders qualified in accordance with Practice 
A 488/A 488M. 
9. Flanges 
9.1 When a flange from a flanged casting is removed 
to make a weld-end casting, discontinuities may be 
observed that would not have been detrimental in a flanged 
casting. The disposition of the casting shall be subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer. 
10. Quality 
10.1 The surface of the casting shall be free of adhering 
ceramic, scale, cracks, and hot tears as determined by visual 
examination. Other surface discontinuities shall meet the 
visual acceptance standards specified in the order. Unac­
ceptable visual surface discontinuities shall be removed 
and their removal verified by visual examination of the 
resultant cavities. 
10.2 The castings shall not be peened, plugged, or 
impregnated to stop leaks. 
10.3 When additional inspection is desired, Supplemen­
tary Requirements S4, S5, S7, or SlO may be specified. 
11. Hydrostatic Tests 
11.1 Each casting shall be tested after machining to 
the hydrostatic shell test pressures prescribed in ANSI 
B16.5 for the applicable steel rating for which the casting 
is designed. The casting shall not show any leaks. Castings 
ordered for working pressures other than those in the stan­
dard ANSI ratings, or those listed for which test pressures 
are not specified by ANSI B16.5, shall be tested at a pres­
sure agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
11.2 It is realized that the foundry may be unable to 
perform the hydrostatic test prior to shipment, or that the 
purchaser may wish to defer testing until additional work 
or machining has been performed on the casting. Castings 
ordered in the rough state for final machining by the pur­
chaser may be tested hydrostatically prior to shipment by 
the manufacturer at pressures to be agreed upon with the 
purchaser. The foundry, however, is responsible for the 
satisfactory performance of the casting under the final test 
required in 1 1. 1. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 All castings shall be made in a workmanlike man­
ner and shall conform to the dimensions on drawings fur­
nished by the purchaser. When the pattern is supplied by 
the purchaser or is produced using a die supplied by the 
purchaser, the dimensions of the casting shall be as predi­
cated by the pattern or die, unless otherwise agreed upon. 
12.2 Machined welding ends shall be suitably protected 
against damage during shipping. 
13. Retests 
13.1 If the results of the mechanical tests do not con­
form to the requirements specified, retests are permitted 
as outlined in Test Methods and Definitions A 370. At the 
manufacturer's option, castings may be reheat treated and 
retested. Testing after reheat treatment shall consist of the 
full number of specimens taken from locations complying 
with the specification or order. 
14. Inspection 
14.1 The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's 
inspector all reasonable facilities necessary to satisfy that 
the material is being produced and furnished in accordance 
with the applicable specification. Foundry inspection by 
the purchaser shall not interfere unnecessarily with the 
manufacturer's operations. All tests and inspections, with 
the exception of product analysis (5.2), are the responsibil­
ity of the manufacturer. 
15. Rejection and Rehearing 
15.1 Any rejection based on test reports shall be 
reported to the manufacturer within 30 days from the 
receipt of the test reports by the purchaser. 
15.2 Material that shows unacceptable discontinuities 
as determined by the acceptance standards specified in the 
order subsequent to its acceptance at the manufacturer's 
works will be rejected, and the manufacturer shall be noti­
fied within 30 days after discovery of the rejectable con­
dition. 
15.3 Samples that represent rejected material shall be 
preserved for two weeks from the date of transmission of 
the test report. In case of dissatisfaction with the results 
of the tests, the manufacturer may make claim for a rehear­
ing with that time. 
16. Certification 
16.1 The manufacturer's certification shall be furnished 
to the purchaser stating that the material was manufactured, 
1437

=== Page 1496 ===

SA-985/SA·985M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
sampled, tested, and inspected in accordance with the mate­
rial specification (including year of issue) and was found 
to meet the requirements. 
16.2 As applicable, the certification also shall include: 
16.2.1 Material specification and grade, 
16.2.2 Pattern or part number, 
16.2.3 Master heat number or serial number traceable 
to the master heat number,

specification and supplementary requirements specified in 
the purchase order, 
16.2.5 Mechanical property results required by the 
specification and supplementary requirements specified in 
the purchase order, 
16.2.6 Statement of satisfactory inspection, visual, 
and nondestructive testing specified in the purchase order, 
16.2.7 Manufacturer's name, and 
16.2.8 Additional purchase order requirements. 
16.3 A signature is not required on the certification; 
however, the document shall identify clearly the organiza­
tion submitting the certification. Notwithstanding the 
absence of a signature, the organization submitting the 
certification is responsible for its content. 
17. Product Marking 
17.1 Castings shall be marked for material identifica­
tion with the grade symbols (WCB, WC9, CF8M, and so 
forth). In addition, master heat numbers, or serial numbers 
that are traceable to master heat numbers, shall be marked 
on all pressure-containing casting individually weighing 
50 lb [25 kg] or more. Pressure-containing castings 
weighing less than 50 lb [25 kg] shall be marked with 
either the master heat number or a lot number that will 
identify the casting as to the month in which it was poured. 
Marking shall be in such position as not to injure the 
usefulness of the casting. 
17.2 On casting for which impact property require­
ments are specified, stamped markings using low-stress 
stamps shall be on a raised pad when such pad can be 
made a part of the castings. 
17 .3 Castings shall be marked with the manufacturer's 
identification or symbols except when other provisions 
have been made between the manufacturer and purchaser.

Riser Design 
The length of the riser at the base wi 11 
be the same as the top length of the 
leg. The length of the riser at the top 
therefore depends on the amount of 
taper added to the riser. 
The width of the riser at the base of a 
multiple-leg coupon shall be n, 2¼ 
[57 mm] - % [16 mm] where n 
equals the number of legs attached to 
the coupon. The width of the riser at 
the top is therefore dependent on the 
amount of taper added to the riser. 
Use of and size is at the option of the 
foundry. 
The minimum height of the riser shall be 
2 in. [51 mmJ. The maximum height 
is at the option of the foundry for the 
following reasons: Cal Many risers are 
cast open, (bl different compositions 
may require variation in risering for 
soundness, (cl different pouring tem­
peratures may require variation in ris­
ering for soundness. 
NOTE 1 - Test Coupons for Large and Heavy Steel Castings: The test coupons in Fig. 2 are to be used for large and heavy steel castings. 
However, at the option of the foundry the cross-sectional area and length of the standard coupon may be increased as desired. 
NOTE 2 - Bend Bar: If a bend bar is required, an alternate design (as shown by dotted lines in Fig. 2) is indicated.

S21.1 A heat-treatment chart showing time and temper­
ature shall be prepared and be available for inspection by 
the purchaser. 
S22. Heat Treatment 
S22.1 Test specimens shall be heat treated together 
with the castings they represent. Heat-treated specimens 
shall be tested and shall meet the tensile and impact proper­
ties specified. 
S22.2 The remaining test specimens from Supplemen­
tary Requirement S22. l representing the casting shall be 
treated thermally after the final (foundry) heat treatment 
to simulate heat treatments below the transformation tem­
perature, which the casting may receive during fabrication, 
and then tested for mechanical properties. Time, tempera­
ture, and cooling rate shall be as stated in the order. In the 
case of postweld heat treatment, the total time at tempera­
ture or temperatures for the test material shall be at least 
80% of the total time at temperature or temperatures during 
actual postweld heat treatment of the fabrication of which 
the casting or castings are a part. The total time at tempera­
ture or temperatures for the test material may be performed 
in a single cycle. When this Supplementary Requirement 
is specified, the welding qualification test metal must be 
processed in the same manner. 
S23. Macroetch Test 
S23.1 Apply Supplementary Requirement S 1 for the 
spectrographic determination and reporting of the total 
residual aluminum content of all heats of ferritic and mar­
tensitic steels subjected to this macroetch test. 
S23.2 When the heat analysis indicates a total residual 
aluminum content in excess of 0.08%, the manufacturer 
shall etch a cross section of the casting with the heaviest 
section for which this supplementary requirement is 
invoked, or a coupon attached to that heaviest section or 
an area directly under a riser (see Note S23.l). Cross sec­
tions, from a separately cast test block from the same heat 
and a thickness representative of the heaviest section of 
castings purchased under this supplementary requirement, 
also may be used for macroetch testing. The etching shall 
be performed on the selected section after its heat treatment, 
that is, after annealing, normalizing, or quenching and 
tempering following the initial cooling of the steel below 
the transformation range. 
NOTE S23.l - High-strength martensitic castings, in particular, may 
be damaged beyond use if the etch is applied directly to the casting. 
S23.3 The preparation of the surface and the macro­
etching procedure with solution No. 1 (1: 1 HCl) of Table 5 
in Test Method E 340 shall be followed. The resulting 
etched surface shall be compared and rated with the refer­
ence photographs in Fig. S23.l depicting ten levels of 
severity of intergranular network structures indicative of 
the presence of aluminum nitride, or other constituents 
prone toward precipitating at grain boundaries during solid­
ification and subsequent cooling. Table S23.1 relates the 
severity levels shown in these photographs with specific 
delineation widths and percent of boundary outlining in 
the etched structures. 
S23.4 Castings represented by etched structures exhib-
. iting a network rating in excess of Severity Level 4 shall 
be considered unacceptable until further evaluations are 
completed. The acceptability of individual castings may 
be determined by etching sections of each casting to ascer­
tain the network severity level. Disposition ofunacceptable 
castings shall be a matter of agreement between the manu­
facturer and purchaser. Those castings exhibiting etched 
severity levels greater than four may be further evaluated 
by any of the following agreed upon methods. 
S23.4.1 Fracture testing to determine the amount of 
"rock candy" structure. 
S23.4.2 Mechanical testing (bend, tensile, and so 
forth) to determine the ductility characteristics. 
S23.4.3 Weld testing to determine crack susceptibil­
ity in the heat~affected zone of a circular groove welded 
with cellulose coated electrodes. 
S23.5 Alternatively, by agreement, it is permissible 
to subject castings from an unacceptable heat to a high 
temperature solution treatment prior to the normal produc­
tion heat-treatment and subsequently macroetch test each 
casting. 
S24. Specified Ferrite Content Range 
S24.1 The chemical composition of the heat shall be 
controlled such that the ferrite content, as determined by 
the chemical composition procedure of Practice 
A 800 / A 800M, shall be in accordance with the specified 
ferrite content range. 
S24.2 The specified ferrite content range shall be as 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
The minimum specified ferrite content range shall be 10% 
with the minimum ferrite content being no lower than 
the percent necessary to achieve the minimum mechanical 
properties required for the alloy. 
S24.3 Should the purchaser wish to have the ferrite 
content determined by either magnetic response or metallo­
graphic methods, the purchaser should impose Supplemen­
tary Requirement S 1 or S2 of Practice A 800 / A 800M.

APPENDIX 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. ALLOY DESIGNATIONS FOR CAST 
STAINLESS STEELS 
Xl.1 Cast stainless steels usually are specified on the 
basis of composition using the alloys designation system 
established by the Alloy Casting Institute (ACI). The ACI 
designations, for example, CF8M, have been adopted by 
ASTM and are preferred for cast alloys over the designa­
tions used by the American Iron and Steel Institute for 
similar wrought steels. 
Xl.2 This nomenclature system has served successfully 
to accommodate changes in old alloys and to designate 
new ones. 
X X 
Service Classification J 
Letter _________ -' 
Ternary Diagram Location 
Letter _________ __, 
00 X X X 
Carbon Content Number ______ __, 
III Special Elements Letter 
Xl.2.1 Service Classification Letter - The first letter 
of the cast stainless steel designation system identifies the 
intended service application of the alloy. The letter Cindi­
cates corrosion-resistant service, and the letter H indicates 
the heat-resistant service at and above 1200°F [650°C]. 
Xl.2.2 Ternary Diagram Location Letter- The second 
letter indicates the approximate location of the nickel and 
chromium contents of the alloy grade on the FeCrNi ternary 
diagram shown in Fig. Xl. 1. 
Xl.2.3 Carbon Content Number- For C service classi­
fications, this single or dual digit numeral represents the 
maximum carbon content in units of 0.01 %. For H service 
classifications, this number represents the midpoint of the 
range of carbon content in terms of 0.01 % with a 
±0.05% limit. 
Xl.2.4 Special Elements Letters - Additional letters 
following the numeral represents special chemical elements 
in the alloy grade, such as M for molybdenum, C for 
columbium, Cu for copper, and W for tungsten. There are 
two exceptions. The letter A indicates "Controlled Ferrite," 
and the letter F indicates "Free Machining." 
Xl.3 In Fig. Xl.l, unlettered NiCr ranges are associ­
ated with the nearest lettered location. They may be the 
result of differences between corrosion and heat-resistance 
types or because of the influence of additional elements, 
for example, the precipitation hardening grade CB- 7 Cu.

Specification for 
Hot lsostatically-Pressed Stainless Steel Flanges, Fittings, 
Valves, and Parts for High Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers hot isostatically-pressed, pow­
der metallurgy, stainless steel piping components for use in 
pressure systems. Included are flanges, fittings, valves, and 
similar parts made to specified dimensions or to dimensional 
standards, such as in ASME specification B16.5. 
1.2 Several grades of martensitic, austenitic, age hardening, 
and austenitic-ferritic stainless steels are included in this 
specification. 
1.3 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when 
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply 
only when specified individually by the purchaser in the order. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" 
specification designation (SI units), however, the material shall 
be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as the standard. Within the text, 
the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.6 The following safety hazards caveat pertains only to test 
methods portions 8.1, 8.2, 9.5 - 9.7, and Section 10 of this 
specification: This standard does not purport to address all of 
the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica­
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Terminology 
3 .1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 can, n-the container used to encapsulate the powder 
during the pressure consolidation process; it is partially or fully 
removed from the final part. 
3.1.2 compact, n-the consolidated powder from one can. It 
may be used to make one or more parts. 
3.1.3 consolidation, n-the bonding of adjacent powder 
particles in a compact under pressure by heating to a tempera­
ture below the melting point of the powder. 
3 .1.4 fill stem, n-the part of the compact used to fill the can. 
It is not usually integral to the part produced. 
3.1.5 hot isostatic-pressing, n-a process for simultaneously 
heating and forming a compact in which the powder is 
contained in a sealed formable enclosure usually made from 
metal and the so-contained powder is subjected to equal 
pressure from all directions at a temperature high enough to 
permit plastic deformation and consolidation of the powder 
particles to take place. 
3.1.6 lot, n-a number of parts made from a single powder 
blend following the same manufacturing practice. 
3.1.7 part, n-a single item coming from a compact, either 
prior to or after machining. 
3.1.8 powder blend, n-a homogeneous mixture of powder 
from one or more heats of the same grade. 
3.1.9 rough part, n-the part prior to final machining. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify in the 
purchase order all requirements that are necessary for material 
ordered under this specification. Such requirements may 
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of parts), 
4.1.2 Name of material or UNS number, 
4.1.3 ASTM designation and year of issue, 
4.1.4 Dimensions (tolerances and surface finishes should be 
included), 
4.1.5 Microstructure examination if required (5.1.4), 
4.1.6 Inspection (15.1), 
4.1.7 Whether rough part or finished machined part (8.2.2), 
4.1.8 Supplementary requirements, if any, 
4.1.9 Additional requirements (See 7.2 and 17.1), and 
4.1.10 Requirement, if any, that the manufacturer shall 
submit drawings for approval showing the shape of the rough 
part before machining and the exact location of test specimen 
material (See 9.3). 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Manufacturing Practice: 
5.1.1 Compacts shall be manufactured by placing a single 
powder blend into a can, evacuating the can, and sealing it. The 
can material shall be selected to ensure that it has no deleteri­
ous effect on the final product. The entire assembly shall be 
heated and placed under sufficient pressure for a sufficient 
period of time to ensure that the final consolidated part meets 
the density requirements of 8.1.1.1. One or more parts shall be 
machined from a single compact. 
5 .1.2 The powder shall be prealloyed and made by a melting 
method capable of producing the specified chemical 
composition, such as but not limited to, air or vacuum 
induction melting, followed by gas atomization. 
5.1.3 When powder from more than one heat of the same 
grade is used to make a blend, the heats shall be mixed 
thoroughly to ensure homogeneity. 
5.1.4 The compact shall be sectioned and the microstructure 
examined to check for porosity and other internal imperfec­
tions. It shall meet the requirements of 8.1.2. The sample shall 
be taken from the fill stem or from a location in a part as agreed 
upon by the manufacturer and purchaser. 
5.1.5 Unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, the 
manufacturer shall remove the can material from the surfaces 
of the consolidated compacts by chemical or mechanical 
methods such as by pickling or machining. This removal shall 
be done before or after heat treatment at the option of the 
manufacturer (See Footnote 1). 
Nore I-Often, it is advantageous to leave the can material in place 
until after heat treatment or further thermal processing of the consolidated 
compact. 
5;1.6 Supplementary Requirements Sl9, S20, S21, and S22 
are mandatory. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel, both as a blend and as a part, shall conform to 
the requirements for chemical composition prescribed in Table 
1. Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology of A751 shall 
apply. 
6.1.1 A representative sample of each blend of powder shall 
be analyzed by the manufacturer to determine the percentage of 
elements prescribed in Table 1. The blend shall conform to the 
chemical composition requirements prescribed in Table 1.

6.1.2 When required by the purchaser, the chemical com­
position of a sample from one part from each lot of parts shall 
be determined by the manufacturer. The composition of the 
sample shall conform to the chemical requirements prescribed 
in Table 1. 
6.2 Addition of lead, selenium, or other unspecified ele­
ments for the purpose of improving the machinability of the 
compact shall not be permitted. 
6.3 The steel shall not contain an unspecified element other 
than nitrogen, for the ordered grade, to the extent that the steel 
conforms to the requirements of another grade for which that 
element is a specified element having a required minimum 
content. 
7. Heat Treatment 
7.1 Except as provided in 7.2, the final heat treatment of all 
parts shall be in compliance with the requirements of Table 2. 
After hot isostatic-pressing and prior to final heat treatment, the 
compacts are permitted to be annealed, at the option of the 
producer, either as a part of the consolidation process or as a 
separate operation. 
7.2 When agreed upon by the purchaser, liquid quenching 
may be applied to the martensitic stainless steels in place of the 
furnace cool or air cool specified in Table 2, provided that such 
quenching is followed by tempering in the temperature ranges 
as required in Table 2. Martensitic parts that are liquid 
quenched and tempered shall be marked "QT." 
7.3 The final heat treatment shall be performed before or 
after machining at the option of the producer. 
7.4 See Section S16 if a particular heat treatment method is 
specified by the purchaser in the purchase order. 
8. Structural Integrity Requirements 
8.1 Microporosity-The parts shall be free of microporosity 
as demonstrated by measurement of density as provided in 
8.1.1 or by microstructural examination as provided in 8.1.2. 
8.1.1 Density Measurement: 
8 .1.1.1 The density measurement shall be used for accep­
tance of material but not for rejection of material. The 
measured density for each production lot shall exceed 99 % of 
the density typical of that grade when wrought and in the same 
heat treated condition as the sample. A production lot that fails 
to meet this acceptance criterion is permitted to be tested at the 
option of the producer, for microporosity in accordance with 
the microstructural examination as provided in 8.1.2. 
8.1.1.2 Density shall be determined for one sample from 
each production lot by measuring the difference in mass of the 
sample when weighed in air and when weighed in water and 
multiplying this difference by the density of water (Archi­
mede' s principle). The equipment used shall be capable of 
determining density within ±0.004 lb/in. 3 [0.10 g/cm 3 ]. 
Alternatively, at the option of the producer, it is permitted to 
use Test Method B311 to determine the density. 
8.1.1.3 At the option of the producer, the density shall be 
compared to the room temperature density typical of wrought 
steels of the same class of grades, 0.28 lb/in.3 [7.8 g/cm 3 ] for 
age-hardening, martensitic, and austenitic-ferritic grades, and 
0.29 lb/in.3 [8.0 g/cm 3 ] for austenitic grades, or to the density 
of a wrought reference sample of the same grade heat treated 
in accordance with the requirements of Table 2 (See Note 2). 
Norn 2-The actual density of stainless steel varies slightly witl1 
composition and heat treatment. For this reason, small differences in the 
measured density from the typical density for a class of grades may be the 
result of differences in alloy content, heat treatment, or microporosity. 
When density values are measured that are less than the density typical of 
a class of grades, it is appropriate to examine the sample for microporosity 
by the more specific metallographic examination procedures. 
8.1.2 Microstructural Examination: 
8.1.2.1 The microstructure shall be examined at 20-50x, 
100-200x, and 1000-2000x and shall be reasonably uniform 
and shall be free of voids, laps, cracks, and porosity. 
8.1.2.2 One sample from each production lot shall be 
examined. The sample shall be taken after hot-isostatic press­
ing or after final heat treatment. The sample shall be taken from 
the component, stem, protrusion, or test part made from a 
single powder blend consolidated in the same hot isostatic 
press using the same pressure, temperature, and time param­
eters and heat-treated in the same final heat-treatment charge. 
The microstructure shall meet the requirements of 8.1.2.1. 
8.1.2.3 If the sample fails to meet the requirements for 
acceptance, each part in the lot is permitted to be retested and 
those that pass shall be accepted. 
8.2 Hydrostatic Tests-After they have been machined, 
pressure-containing parts shall be tested to the hydrostatic shell 
test pressures prescribed in ASME B16.5 for the applicable 
steel rating for which the part is designed and shall show no 
leaks. Parts ordered under these specifications for working 
pressures other than those listed in the ASME B16.5 ratings 
shall be tested to such pressures as may be agreed upon 
between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
8.2.l No hydrostatic test is required for weld neck or other 
flanges. 
8.2.2 The compact manufacturer is not required to perfmm 
pressure tests on rough parts that are to be finish machined by 
others. The fabricator of the finished part is not required to 
pressure test parts that are designed to be pressure containing 
only after assembly by welding into a larger structure. The 
manufacturer of the compacts, however, shall be responsible, 
as required in 16.1 for the satisfactory performance of the parts 
under the final test required in 8.2. 
8.3 Ultrasonic Tests-When specified in the order, 
austenitic-ferritic stainless steel parts made from S32505 shall 
be ultrasonic tested according to the procedures described in 
Section S7. 
9. Mechanical Properties 
9 .1 The mate1ial shall conform to the requirements for 
mechanical properties prescribed in Table 3 at room tempera­
ture. 
9.2 Sample shall be from the component, stem, protrusion, 
or test part made from a single powder blend consolidated in 
the same hot isostatic press using the same pressure, 
temperature, and time parameters and heat-treated in the same 
final heat-treatment charge. If repair welding is required (See

8 For sections over 5 in. [130 mm] in thickness, the minimum tensile strength shall be 70 ksi [485 MPa]. 
c For sections over 5 in. [130 mm] in thickness, the minimum tensile strength shall be 65 ksi [450 MPa]. 
9.5 Tension Tests: 
9.5.1 Age-Hardening and Martensitic Stainless Steels-One 
tension test shall be made for each production lot in each heat 
treatment charge. When the heat treating cycles are the same 
and the furnaces (either batch or continuous type) are con­
trolled within ± 25 °F [ ± 14 °C] and equipped with recording 
pyrometers so that complete records of heat treatment are 
available, then only one tension test from each production lot 
of each type of part (See Note 3) and section size is required 
instead of one test from each production lot in each heat­
treatment charge. 
Norn 3-"Type" in this case is used to describe the shape of the part 
such as a flange, elbow, tee, and so forth. 
9.5.2 Austenitic and Austenitic-Ferritic Stainless Steels­
One tension test shall be made for each production lot. The 
tension test specimen shall be made from material accompa­
nying the parts in final heat treatment. 
9.5.3 Testing shall be performed as specified in Specifica­
tion A961/A961M using the largest feasible of the round 
specimens. 
9.6 Hardness Tests: 
9.6.1 When two or more parts are produced, a minimum of 
two pieces per batch or continuous run as defined in 9.6.2 shall 
be hardness tested as specified in Specification A961/A961M

to ensure that the parts are within the hardness limits given for 
each grade in Table 3. When only one part is produced, it shall 
be hardness tested as required. The purchaser is permitted to 
verify that the requirement has been met by testing at any 
location on any part provided such testing does not render the 
part useless. 
9.6.2 When the reduced number of tension tests permitted 
by 9.5.1 is applied, additional hardness tests shall be made on 
parts or samples as defined in 9.2 distributed throughout the 
charge. At least eight samples shall be checked from each batch 
load and a least one check/h shall be made from a continuous 
run. When the furnace charge is less than eight parts, each part 
shall be checked. If any hardness test result falls outside the 
prescribed limits, the entire lot of parts shall be reheat treated 
and the requirements of 9.5.1 shall apply. 
9.7 Fatigue Tests-When specified in the order, the fatigue 
strength of austenitic stainless steel components intended for 
service above 1000 °F [540 °C] shall be determined in 
accordance with Section S18. 
10. Corrosion Testing 
10.1 Corrosion testing is not required by this specification. 
10.2 Austenitic stainless steels shall be capable of meeting

on parts supplied to this specification. Samples for analysis 
shall be taken from midway between the center and surface of 
solid parts, midway between the inner and outer surfaces of 
hollow parts, midway between the center and surface of 
full-size prolongations, or from broken mechanical test speci­
mens. The chemical composition thus determined shall con­
form to Table 1 with the tolerances as stated in Table 4. 
12. Reheat Treatment 
12.1 If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform to 
the requirements specified, the manufacturer is permitted to 
reheat treat the paits and repeat the tests specified in Section 9, 
but not more than twice. 
13. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion 
Protection 
13.1 The requirements of Specification A961/A961M apply 
to hot isostatically pressed finished parts.

1. 1 This specification covers hot isostatically-pressed, pow­
der metallurgy, alloy steel piping components for use in 
pressure systems. Included are flanges, fittings, valves, and 
similar parts made to specified dimensions or to dimensional 
standards, such as in ASME Specification B16.5. 
1.2 Several grades of alloy steels are included in this 
specification. 
1.3 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when 
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply 
only when specified individually by the purchaser in the order. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" 
specification designation (SI units), however, the material shall 
be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as the standard. Within the text, 
the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.6 The following safety hazards caveat pertains only to test 
methods portions, 8.1, 8.2, and 9.5 - 9.7 of this specification: 
This standard does not purport to address all of the safety 
concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility 
of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, 
health, and environmental practices and to determine the 
applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­

4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify in the 
purchase order all requirements that are necessary for material 
ordered under this specification. Such requirements may 
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of parts). 
4.1.2 Name of material or UNS number. 
4.1.3 ASTM designation and year of issue. 
4.1.4 Dimensions (tolerances and surface finishes). 
4.1.5 Microstructure examination, if required (5.1.5). 
4.1.6 Inspection (14.1). 
4.1.7 Whether rough part or finished machined part (8.2.2). 
4.1.8 Supplementary requirements, if any. 
4.1.9 Additional requirements (see 7.2.1 and 16.1). 
4.1.10 Requirement, if any, that the manufacturer shall 
submit drawings for approval showing the shape of the rough 
part before machining and the exact location of test specimen 
material (see 9.3.1). 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Manufacturing Practice: 
5.1.1 Powder should be protected during storage to prevent 
the detrimental pick-up of oxygen and other contaminants. 
5.1.2 Compacts shall be manufactured by placing a single 
powder blend into a can, evacuating the can, and sealing it. The 
can material shall be selected to ensure that it has no deleteri­
ous effect on the final product. The entire assembly shall be 
heated and placed under sufficient pressure for a sufficient 
period of time to ensure that the final consolidated part meets 
the density requirements of 8.1.2.1. One or more parts shall be 
machined from a single compact. 
5 .1.3 The powder shall be prealloyed and made by a melting 
method capable of producing the specified chemical 
composition, such as but not limited to air or vacuum induction 
melting, followed by gas atomization. 
5 .1.4 When powder from more than one heat is used to 
make a blend, the heats shall be mixed thoroughly to ensure 
homogeneity. 
5 .1.5 The compact shall be sectioned and the microstmcture 
examined to check for porosity and other internal imperfec­
tions and shall meet the requirements of 8.1.3. The sample shall 
be taken from the fill stem or from a location in a part as agreed 
upon by the manufacturer and purchaser. 
5.1.6 Unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, the 
manufacturer shall remove the can material from the surfaces 
of the consolidated compacts by chemical or mechanical 
methods, such as by pickling or machining. This removal shall 
be done before or after heat treatment at the option of the 
manufacturer (see Note 1). 
Norn I-Often, it is advantageous to leave the can material in place 
nntil after heat treatment or further thermal processing of the consolidated 
compact. 
5.1.7 Supplementary Requirements S2, S4, S5, and S14 are 
mandatory. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel both as a blend and as a part shall conform to 
the requirements for chemical composition prescribed in Table 
1. Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751 shall apply. 
6.1.1 A representative sample of each blend of powder shall 
be analyzed by the manufacturer to determine the percentage of 
elements prescribed in Table 1. The blend shall conform to the 
chemical composition requirements prescribed in Table 1. 
6.1.2 When required by the purchaser, the chemical com­
position of a sample from one part from each lot of parts shall 
be determined by the manufacturer. The composition of the 
sample shall conform to the chemical composition require­
ments prescribed in Table 1. 
6.2 Addition of lead, selenium, or other unspecified ele­
ments for the purpose of improving the machinability of the 
compact shall not be permitted. 
6.3 The steel shall not contain an unspecified element, for 
the ordered grade, to the extent that the steel conforms to the 
requirements of another grade for which that element is a 
specified element having a required minimum content. 
7. Heat Treatment 
7.1 After hot isostatic-pressing, the compacts shall be an­
nealed prior to heat treating in accordance with the require­
ments of Table 2. At the option of the producer, this anneal 
shall be a separate operation following powder consolidation or 
shall be a part of the consolidation process. 
7.2 The alloy steels shall be heat treated in accordance with 
the requirements of 7 .1 and Table 2. 
7.2.1 Liquid Quenching-When agreed to by the purchaser, 
liquid quenching followed by tempering shall be permitted 
provided the temperatures in Table 2 for each grade are 
utilized. 
7.2.1.1 Marking-Parts that are liquid quenched and tem­
pered shall be marked "QT".

7.3 See Supplementary Requirement S12 if a particular heat 
treatment method is specified by the purchaser in the purchase 
order. 
7.4 Time of Heat Treatment-Heat treatment of the hot 
isostatically-pressed parts shall be performed before or after 
machining at the option of the manufacturer. 
8. Structural Integrity Requirements 
8.1 Microporosity: 
8.1.1 The parts shall be free of microporosity as demon­
strated by measurement of density as provided in 8.1.2 or by 
microstructural examination as provided in 8.1.3. 
8.1.2 Density Measurement: 
8.1.2.1 The density measurement shall be used for accep­
tance of material but not for rejection of material. The 
measured density for each production lot shall exceed 99 % of 
the density typical of that grade when wrought and in the same 
heat treated condition as the sample. A production lot that fails 
to meet this acceptance criterion is permitted, at the option of 
the producer, to be tested for microporosity in accordance with 
the microstructural examination as provided in 8.1.3. 
8.1.2.2 Density shall be determined for one sample from 
each production lot by measuring the difference in weight of 
the sample when weighed in air and when weighed in water 
and multiplying this difference by the density of water (Archi­
mede's principle). The equipment used shall be capable of 
1472 
furnace cool 
air cool B 1250 [675] 
air cool B 1350 [730] 
furnace cool B B 
furnace cool B B 
air cool B 1250 [675] 
determining density within ±0.004 lb/in. 3 [0.10 g/cm 3 ]. 
Alternatively, at the option of the producer, it is permitted to 
use Test Method B311 to determine the density. 
8.1.2.3 At the option of the producer, the density shall be 
compared to the room temperature density typical of wrought 
alloy steels or to the density of a wrought reference sample of 
the same grade heat treated in accordance with the require­
ments of Table 2 (see Note 2). The typical density for alloy 
steel in the annealed condition at· room temperature is 0.28 
lb/in.3 [7.8 g/cm 3 ]. 
NoTE 2-The actual density of alloy steel varies slightly with compo­
sition and heat treatment. For this reason, small differences in the 
measured density from the typical density for a given grade of steel may 
be the result of differences in alloy content, heat treatment, or micropo­
rosity. When density values are measured that are less than the density 
typical of a given grade of steel, it is appropriate to examine the sample 
for microporosity by the more specific metallographic examination 
procedures. 
8.1.3 Microstructural Examination: 
8.1.3.1 The microstructure shall be examined at 20-50x, 
100-200x, and 1000-2000x and shall be reasonably uniform 
and shall be free of voids, laps, cracks, and porosity. 
8.1.3.2 One sample from each production lot shall be 
examined. The sample shall be taken from the component, 
stem, protrusion, or test part made from a single powder blend 
consolidated in the same hot isostatic press using the same 
pressure, temperature, and time parameters and heat-treated in

=== Page 1527 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-989 /SA-989M 
the same final heat treatment charge, after hot isostatic­
pressing or after final heat treatment. The microstructure shall 
meet the requirements of 8.1.3.1. 
8.1.3.3 If the sample fails to meet the requirements for 
acceptance, it is permitted to retest each part in the lot. Each 
part that passes the requirements of 8.1.3.1 shall be accepted. 
8.2 Hydrostatic Tests-After they have been machined, 
pressure-containing parts shall be tested to the hydrostatic shell 
test pressures prescribed in ASME B16.5 for the applicable 
steel rating for which the part is designed, and shall show no 
leaks. Parts ordered under these specifications for working 
pressures other than those listed in the ASME B16.5 ratings 
shall be tested to such pressures as may be agreed upon 
between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
8.2.1 No hydrostatic test is required for welding neck or 
other flanges. 
8.2.2 The compact manufacturer is not required to perform 
pressure tests on rough parts that are to be finish machined by 
others. The fabricator of the finished part is not required to 
pressure test parts that are designed to be pressure-containing 
only after assembly by welding into a larger structure. The 
manufacturer of the compacts, however, shall be responsible as 
required in 15.1 for the satisfactory performance of the parts 
under the final test required in 8.2. 
9. Mechanical Properties 
9 .1 The material shall conform to . the requirements for 
mechanical properties prescribed in Table 3 at room tempera­
ture. 
9.2 Mechanical test samples shall be obtained from the 
component stem, protrusion, or test part made from a single 
powder blend consolidated in the same hot-isostatic press using 
the same pressure, temperature, and time parameter and 
heat-treated in the same final heat-treatment charge. If repair 
welding is required (see Section 15), the test specimens prior to 
testing shall accompany the repaired parts if a post weld heat 
treatment is done. 
9.3 For normalized and tempered parts, or quenched and 
tempered parts, the central axis of the test specimen shall 
correspond to the ¼ T plane or deeper position where Tis the 
maximum heat treated thickness of the represented part. In 
addition, for quenched and tempered parts, the midlength of the 
test specimen shall be at least T from any second heat treated 
surface. When the section thickness does not permit this 
positioning, the test specimen shall be positioned as near as 
possible to the prescribed location, as agreed to by the 
purchaser and the supplier. 
9.3.1 Alternatively, with prior approval of the purchaser, it 
is permitted to take the test specimen for the steel parts at a 
depth (t) corresponding to the distance from the area of 
significant stress to the nearest heat treated surface and at least 
twice this distance (2t) from any second surface. The test 
depth, however, shall not be nearer to one treated surface than 
¾ in. [19 mm] and to the second treated surface than 1 ½ in. 
[38 mm]. This method of test specimen location would 
normally apply to complex parts, or parts with thick cross­
sectional areas where ¼ T and T testing (see 9.3) is not 
practical. Sketches showing the exact test locations shall be 
approved by the purchaser when this method is used. 
9 .4 For annealed alloy steels the test specimen may be taken 
from any convenient location. 
9.5 Tension Test: 
9.5.1 One tension test shall be made for each production lot 
in each heat treatment charge. 
9.5.1.1 When the heat treating cycles are the same and the 
furnaces ( either batch or continuous type) are controlled within 
±25 °F [±14 °C] and equipped with recording pyrometers so 
that complete records of heat treatment are available, then only 
one tension test from each production lot of each type of part, 
and section size is required instead of one test from each 
production lot in each heat-treatment charge. The term "type," 
as used here, designates a characteristic shape of a part, such as 
flange, elbow, tee, and so forth. 
9.5.1.2 The tension test specimen shall be made from 
material accompanying the parts in final heat treatment. 
9.5.2 Testing shall be performed as specified in Specifica­
tion A961/A961M using the largest feasible of the round 
specimens. 
9.6 Hardness Tests: 
9.6.1 When two or more parts are produced, a minimum of 
two pieces per batch or continuous run as defined in 9.6.2 shall 
be hardness tested as specified in Specification A961/A961M 
to ensure that the parts are within the hardness limits given for 
each grade in Table 3. When only one part is produced, it shall 
be hardness tested as required. The purchaser is permitted to 
verify that the requirement has been met by testing at any 
location on any part, provided such testing does not render the 
part useless. 
9.6.2 When the reduced number of tension tests permitted 
by 9 .5 .1.1 is applied, additional hardness tests shall be made on

parts or samples as defined in 9 .2 distributed throughout the 
charge. At least eight samples shall be checked from each batch 
load and a least one check/h shall be made from a continuous 
run. When the furnace batch charge is less than eight parts, 
each part shall be checked. If any hardness test result falls 
outside the prescribed limits, the entire lot of parts shall be 
reheat treated and the requirements of 9.5.1 shall apply. 
9.7 Fatigue Tests-When specified in the order, the fatigue 
strength of alloy steel, except UNS K90901, components 
intended for service above 800 °F [425 °C] and for UNS 
K90901 components intended for service above 1000 °F 
[540 °C] shall be tested in accordance with the requirements of 
Supplementary Requirement S13. 
10. Product Analysis 
10.1 The purchaser is permitted to make a product analysis 
on parts supplied to this specification. The chemical composi-
tion of a sample from one part from each lot of parts shall be 
determined by the manufacturer. Samples for analysis shall be 
taken from midway between the center and surface of solid 
parts, midway between the inner and outer surfaces of hollow 
parts, midway between the center and surface of full-size 
prolongations, or from broken mechanical test specimens. The 
chemical composition thus determined shall conform to Table 
1 with the tolerances as stated in Table 4 or Table 5.

Specification for 
Castings, Austenitic-Ferritic (Duplex) Stainless Steel, for 
Pressure-Containing Parts 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers austenitic-ferritic (duplex) 
stainless steel castings for valves, flanges, fittings, and other 
pressure-containing parts. 
1.2 The duplex stainless steels offer a combination of 
enhanced mechanical properties and corrosion resistance when 
properly balanced in composition and properly heat treated. 
Ferrite levels are not specified, but these grades will develop a 
range of approximately 30 to 60 % ferrite with the balance 
austenite. It is the responsibility of the purchaser to determine 
which grade shall be furnished depending on design and 
service conditions, mechanical properties, and corrosion­
resistant characteristics. 
Nom I-Because of the possibility of precipitation of embrittling 
phases, the grades included in this specification are not recommended for 
service at temperatures above 600 °F [315 °C]. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the standard. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

approximately 30 to 60 % ferrite with the balance austenite. 
4. General Conditions for Delivery 
4.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the applicable requirements of Specification A 703/ A 703M, 
including the supplementary requirements that are indicated on 
the purchaser order. Failure to comply with the general 
requirements of Specification A 703/ A 703M constitutes non­
conformance with this specification. In case of conflict be­
tween the requirements of this specification and Specification 
A 703/ A 703M, this specification shall prevail. 
5. Ordering Information 
5.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements may include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
