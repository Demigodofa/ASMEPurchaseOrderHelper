1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units apply unless the "M" designa­
tion (SI) of the product specification is specified in the order. 
NoTE 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) is used 
in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal diameter," "size," 
"nominal bore," and "nominal size." 
1.4 The following precautionary statement pertains only to 
the test method portion, Section 22, of this specification: This 
standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, 
if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user 
of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and 
environmental practices and determine the applicability of 
regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

=== Page 1542 ===

SA-999 /SA-999M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
4.1.1 The definitions in Terminology A941, except as modi­
fied in this specification or in its referenced product 
specifications, are applicable to this specification. 
5. Ordering Information 
5.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for products ordered under the 
applicable product specification and this general requirements 
specification. Such requirements to be considered include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 
5.1.1 ASTM product specification and year-date, 
5.1.2 Name of product (for example, stainless steel pipe), 
5.1.3 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of pieces), 
5.1.4 Method of manufacture, where applicable (seamless 
or welded), 
5.1.5 Specific type of melting, if required (see 3.4), 
5.1.6 Grade or UNS number, 
5.1.7 Size (NPS and outside diameter and schedule number, 
average (nominal) wall thickness (see 9.1 and 10.1), or 
minimum wall thickness (see 9.2 and 10.1.l), or minimum 
inside diameter (see 11.1)), 
5.1.8 Length (specific or random), 
5.1.9 End finish, 
5.1.10 Optional requirements, 
5.1.11 Specification designation and year of issue, and 
5.1.12 Special requirements or any supplementary 
requirements, or both. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 Chemical Analysis-Samples for chemical analysis and 
method of analysis shall be in accordance with Test Methods, 
Practices, and Terminology A 7 51. 
6.2 Heat Analysis-An analysis of each heat of steel shall be 
made by the steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of 
the specified elements. If secondary melting processes are 
employed, the heat analysis shall be obtained from one 
remelted ingot or the product of one remelted ingot of each 
primary melt. The chemical composition thus determined, or 
that determined from a product analysis made by the tubular 
product manufacturer shall conform to the requirements speci­
fied. 
6.2.1 For steels ordered under product specifications refer­
encing this specification of general requirements, the steel shall 
not contain an unspecified element, other than nitrogen for 
stainless steels, for the ordered grade to the extent that the steel 
conforms to the requirements of another grade for which that 
element is a specified element having a required minimum 
content. For this requirement, a grade is defined as an alloy 
described individually and identified by its own UNS designa­
tion in a table of chemical requirements within any specifica­
tion listed within the scope as being covered by this specifi­
cation. 
6.3 Product Analysis-Product analysis requirements and 
options, if any, shall be as contained in the applicable product 
specification. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Method of Mechanical Tests-The specimens and me­
chanical tests required shall be in accordance with Test 
Methods and Definitions A370, especially Annex A2 thereof, 
or Test Methods A1058. 
7 .1.1 Unless otherwise specified in the ordering 
requirements, Test Methods Al 058 shall apply when the metric 
version of the product specification is specified. 
- 7 .2 Specimens shall be tested at room temperature. 
7.3 Small or subsize specimens as described in Test Meth­
ods and Definitions A370 or Test Methods Al058 may be used 
only when there is insufficient material to prepare one of the 
standard specimens. When using small or subsize specimens, 
the largest one possible shall be used. 
8. Tensile Requirements 
8.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties in the applicable product specification. 
8.2 The yield strength, if specified, shall be determined 
corresponding to a permanent offset of 0.2 % of the gauge 
length or to a total extension of 0.5 % of the gauge length under 
load. 
8.3 If the percentage of elongation of any test specimen is 
less than that specified and any part of the fracture is more than 
¾ in. [19.0 mm] from the center of the gauge length, as 
indicated by scribe marks on the specimen before testing, a 
retest shall be allowed. 
9. Permissible Variation in Mass for Seamless Pipe 
9.1 Except as allowed by 9.2, the mass of any length of 
seamless pipe in sizes NPS 12 and smaller shall not vary more 
than 10 % over or more than 3.5 % under that specified. For 
pipe in sizes larger than NPS 12, the mass of any length of pipe 
shall not vary more than 10 % over or more than 5 % under that 
specified. Unless otherwise specified, the mass of lengths of 
pipe in sizes NPS 4 and smaller shall be determined separately 
or in convenient lots; the mass of lengths of pipe in sizes larger 
than NPS 4 shall be determined separately. 
9.2 Minimum Wall-If the wall thickness of the pipe is 
specified as minimum wall in the purchase order, the mass of 
any length of seamless pipe shall not vary more than 16 % over 
that calculated in accordance with 14.3. Unless otherwise 
specified, the mass of pipe in sizes NPS 4 and smaller shall be 
determined separately or in convenient lots; the mass of pipe in 
sizes larger than NPS 4 shall be determined separately. 
9.3 The specified mass of pipe shall be detennined by 
multiplying its specified or calculated mass per unit length (see 
14.3) by its measured length. 
10. Permissible Variations in Wall Thickness 
10.1 Seamless and Welded-Except as required by 10.l.l, 
the minimum wall thickness at any point shall not be more than 
12.5 % under the nominal wall thickness specified. The mini­
mum wall thickness on inspection is shown in Table Xl.1. 
1488

=== Page 1543 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-999 /SA-999M 
10.1.1 Minimum Wall-If the wall thickness of the pipe is 
specified as minimum wall in the purchase order, there shall be 
no variation under the specified wall thickness. 
10.2 Forged and Bored-The wall thickness shall not vary 
over that specified by more than Vs in. [3.2 mm]. There shall be 
no variation under the specified wall thickness. 
10.3 Cast-The wall thickness shall not vary over that 
specified by more than V16 in. [1.6 mm]. There shall be no 
variation under the specified wall thickness. 
11. Permissible Variations in Inside Diameter 
11.1 Forged and Bored, and Cast-The inside diameter 
shall not vary under that specified by more than V16 in. [1.6 
mm]. There shall be no variation over the specified inside 
diameter. 
12. Permissible Variation in Outside Diameter 
12.1 Variations in outside diameter, unless otherwise agreed 
upon, shall not exceed the limits given in Table I. The 
tolerances for outside diameter include ovality, except as 
provided for in 12.2 and 12.2.1. (See Note 2.) 
12.2 For thin-wall pipe, defined as pipe having a wall 
thickness of 3 % or less of the specified outside diameter, the 
diameter tolerance of Table 1 is applicable only to the mean of 
the extreme (maximum and minimum) outside diameter read­
ings in any one cross-section. 
12.2.1 For thin-wall pipe, the difference in extreme outside 
readings (ovality) in any one cross-section shall not exceed 
1.5 % of the specified outside diameter. 
Norn 2-Thin-wall pipe usually develops significant ovality (out-of­
roundness) during final annealing, straightening, or both. The diameter 
tolerances given in Table 1 are usually not sufficient to provide for 
additional ovality expected in thin-wall pipe. 
13. Permissible Variations in Length 
13.1 Seamless and Welded (No Filler Metal Added)-If 
specific cut lengths of 24 ft [7.3 m] or less are ordered, no 
length of pipe shall be under the length specified or more than 
¼ in. [6 mm] over that specified. 
13.1.1 Permissible variations in length for lengths greater 
than 24 ft [7.3 m] shall be subject to agreement between the 
manufacturer and purchaser. 
13.2 Forged and Bored, Cast, and Cast Cold-Wrought-If 
specific cut lengths are ordered, no length of pipe shall be 
under the length specified or more than 1/s in. [3 mm] over that 
specified. 
13.3 For pipe ordered to random lengths, the lengths and 
variations shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and 
purchaser. 
13.4 No girth welds are permitted unless agreed upon by the 
manufacturer and purchaser. 
14. Mass per Unit Length 
14.1 A system of standard pipe sizes has been approved by 
the American National Standards Institute as ANSI B36.10 and 
B36.19. The standard sizes do not prohibit the production and 
use of other sizes of pipe produced to the various product 
specifications referenced in 1.1. (See Note 3.) 
14.2 For nonstandard sizes of pipe, the calculated mass per 
unit length shall be determined using the following equation: 
M= C(D - t)t (1) 
where: 
C = 10.69 [0.0246615], 
M = mass per unit length, lbm/ft [kg/m], 
D = specified or calculated (from specified inside diameter 
and wall thickness) outside diameter, in. [mm], and 
t = specified wall thickness, in. (to 3 decimal places) [mm 
to 2 decimal places]. 
14.3 When minimum wall thickness is specified in the 
purchase order, the calculated mass per unit length shall be 
determined using Eq 1, obtaining from Table Xl.l the nominal 
wall thickness, t, corresponding to that minimum wall. 
Norn 3-The mass per unit length values given in the American 
National Standards and the calculated masses per unit length determined 
using Eq 1 are based upon carbon steel pipe. The mass per unit length of 
pipe made of ferritic stainless steels may be up to about 5 % less, and that 
made of austeilitic stainless steel up to about 2 % greater, than the values 
given. 
15. Ends 
15.1 Unless otherwise specified, the pipe shall be furnished 
with plain ends. All burrs at the ends of the pipe shall be 
removed. 
16. Straightness 
16.1 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight. 
16.2 For metal-arc welded pipe, the maximum deviation 
from a 10-ft [3.0-m] straightedge placed so that both ends are 
in contact with the pipe shall be Vs in. [3.2 mm]. For metal-arc 
welded pipe with lengths shorter than 10 ft [3.0 m], this 
maximum deviation shall be prorated with respect to the ratio 
of the actual length to 10 ft [3.0 m].

17. Repair by Welding 
17 .1 Repair by welding of defects in seamless pipe (includ­
ing centrifugally cast pipe and forged and bored pipe) and of 
plate defects in welded pipe and, if specifically stated by the 
applicable product specification, weld seam defects in welded 
pipe shall be permitted subject to the approval of the purchaser 
and with the further understanding that the composition of the 
deposited filler metal shall be suitable for the composition 
being welded. Defects shall be thoroughly chipped or ground 
out before welding and each repaired length shall be reheat 
treated or stress relieved as required by the applicable product 
specification. Each length of repaired pipe shall be nondestruc­
tively tested as required by the applicable product specifica­
tion. 
17 .2 Repair welding shall be performed using procedures 
and welders or welding operators that have been qualified in 
accordance with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
Section IX. 
18. Retests 
18.1 If the results of the qualification tests of any lot do not 
conform to the requirements specified in the applicable product 
specification, retests are permitted on additional lengths of pipe 
of double the original number from the same lot, each of which 
shall conform to the requirements specified. Only one retest of 
any lot is permitted. Nonconformance of the retest is cause for 
the rejection of the lot. 
18.2 Any individual length of pipe that meets the test 
requirements is acceptable. It is permitted to retest individual 
lengths that do not confonn to the test requirements, provided 
that the reason for nonconformance is established and the 
nonconforming portion is removed. 
19. Retreatment 
19.1 If individual lengths of pipe selected to represent any 
lot fail to conform to the test requirements, the lot represented 
may be reheat treated and resubmitted for test. The manufac­
turer may reheat treat the pipe, but not more than twice, except 
with the approval of the purchaser. 
20. Test Specimens 
20.1 Test specimens shall be taken from the ends of finished 
pipe prior to any forming operations, or being cut to length. 
20.2 Specimens cut either longitudinally or transversely 
shall be acceptable for the tension test. 
20.3 If any test specimen shows flaws or defective 
machining, the specimen may be discarded and another sub­
stituted. 
21. Flattening Test Requirements 
21.l Seamless and Centrifugally Cast Pipe-A section of 
pipe not less than 2½ in. [60 mm] in length shall be flattened 
cold between parallel plates in two steps. During the first step, 
which is a test for ductility, no cracks or breaks on the inside, 
outside, or end surfaces, except as allowed by 21.3.4, shall 
occur before the distance between the plates is less than the 
value of H calculated as follows: 
H=(l + e)v(e + t/D) 
where: 
H = distance between flattening plates, in. [mm], 
t = specified wall thickness, in. [mm], 
(2) 
D = specified outside diameter, outside diameter correspond­
ing to specified ANSI pipe size, or outside diameter 
calculated by adding 2t (as defined above) to the 
specified inside diameter in. [mm], and 
e = deformation per unit length (constant for a given grade 
of steel, 0.07 for medium carbon steel (maximum 
specified carbon 0.19 % or greater), 0.08 for ferritic 
alloy steel, 0.09 for austenitic steel, 0.09 for duplex 
(ferritic/austenitic) stainless steel, and 0.09 for low­
carbon steel (maximum specified carbon 0.18 % or 
less)). 
During the second step, which is a test for soundness, the 
flattening shall be continued until the specimen breaks or the 
opposite walls of the specimen meet. 
21.2 Welded Pipe-A section of welded pipe not less than 4 
in. [100 mm] in length shall be flattened cold between parallel 
plates in two steps. The weld shall be placed at 90° from the 
direction of the applied force (at the point of maximum 
bending). During the first step, which is a test for ductility, no 
cracks or breaks on the inside or outside surfaces, except as 
provided for in 21.3.4, shall occur before the distance between 
the plates is less than the value of H calculated by Eq 2. During 
the second step, which is a test for soundness, the flattening 
shall be continued until the specimen breaks or the opposite 
walls of the specimen meet. 
21.3 Seamless, Centrifugally Cast, and Welded Pipe: 
21.3.1 Evidence of laminated or defective material or weld 
that is revealed at any time during the entire flattening test shall 
be cause for rejection. 
21.3.2 Surface imperfections not evident in the test speci­
men before flattening, but revealed during the first step of the 
flattening test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish 
requirements. 
21.3.3 Superficial ruptures resulting from surface imperfec­
tions shall not be a cause for rejection. 
21.3.4 When low D-to-t ratio tubular products are tested, 
because the strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably 
high on the inside surface at the six and twelve o'clock 
locations, cracks at these locations shall not be cause for 
rejection if the D-to-t ratio is less than 10. 
22. Nondestructive Test Requirements 
22.1 If required by the applicable product specification or 
the purchase order, the pipe shall be tested by the hydrostatic 
test (see 22.2) or by the nondestructive electric test (see 22.3). 
22.2 Hydrostatic Test: 
22.2.1 Except as allowed by 22.2.2 and 22.2.3, each length 
of pipe shall be tested by the manufacturer to a hydrostatic 
pressure that will produce in the pipe wall a stress not less than 
60 % of the specified minimum yield strength for ferritic alloy 
steel and stainless steel pipe, or 50 % of the specified minimum 
yield strength for austenitic alloy and stainless steel pipe and 
1490

=== Page 1545 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-999 /SA-999M 
for ferritic/austenitic stainless steel pipe. The test pressure or 
stress shall be detennined using the following equation: 
P = 2St/D or S = PD/2t 
where: 
P = hydrostatic test pressure in psi [MPa], 
S = pipe wall stress in psi or [MPa], 
(3) 
t = specified wall thickness, nominal wall thickness accord­
ing to specified ANSI schedule number, or 1.143 times 
the specified minimum wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
D = specified outside diameter, outside diameter correspond­
ing to specified ANSI pipe size, or outside diameter 
calculated by adding 2t (as defined above) to the 
specified inside diameter, in. [mm]. 
22.2.1.1 The hydrostatic test pressure dete1mined by Eq 3 
shall be rounded to the nearest 50 psi [0.5 MPa] for pressures 
below 1000 psi [7 MPa], and to the nearest 100 psi [l MPa] for 
pressures 1000 psi [7 MPa] and above. The hydrostatic test 
may be performed prior to cutting to final length, or prior to 
upsetting, swaging, expanding, bending, or other forming 
operations. 
22.2.2 Regardless of pipe-wall stress-level determined by 
Eq 3, the minimum hydrostatic test pressure required to satisfy 
these requirements need not exceed 2500 psi [17.0 MPa] for 
outside diameters (see D in 22.2) of 3.5 in. [88.9 mm] or less, 
or 2800 psi [19.0 MPa] for outside diameters over 3.5 in. [88.9 
mm]. This does not prohibit testing at higher pressures at the 
option of the manufacturer or as allowed by 22.2.3. 
22.2.3 With concurrence of the manufacturer, a minimum 
hydrostatic test pressure in excess of the requirements of 22.1 
or 22.2, or both, may be stated in the purchase order. 
22.2.4 The test pressure shall be held for a minimum of 5 s. 
For welded pipe, the test pressure shall be held for a time 
sufficient to permit the entire length of the welded seam to be 
inspected. 
22.2.5 The hydrostatic test may not be capable of testing the 
end portion of the pipe. The length of pipe that cannot be tested 
shall be determined by the manufacturer and, if specified in the 
purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
22.3 Nondestructive Electric Test: 
22.3.1 Each pipe shall be examined with a nondestructive 
test in accordance with Practices E213, E309, E426, or E570. 
Unless specifically called out by the purchaser, the selection of 
the nondestructive electric test shall be at the option of the 
manufacturer. Upon agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer, Practice E273 shall be employed in addition to 
one of the full periphery tests. The range of pipe sizes that may 
be examined by each method shall be subject to the limitations 
in the scope of the respective practices. 
22.3.2 The following information is for the benefit of the 
user of this specification: 
22.3.2.1 The reference discontinuities defined in 22.3.8.2 -
22.3.8. 7 are convenient standards for the standardization of 
nondestructive testing equipment. The dimensions of such 
reference discontinuities should not be construed as the mini­
mum size imperfection detectable by such equipment. 
22.3.2.2 The ultrasonic testing (UT) can be performed to 
detect both longitudinally and circumferentially oriented im-
perfections. It should be recognized that different techniques 
should be used to detect differently oriented imperfections. The 
examination may not detect short deep imperfections. 
22.3.2.3 The eddy-current testing (ET) referenced in this 
specification, (see Practices E426 and E309), has the capability 
of detecting significant imperfections, especially of the short 
abrupt type. The sensitivity of this test decreases with wall 
thickness over 0.250 in. (6.4 mm). 
22.3.2.4 The flux leakage examination referred to in this 
specification is capable of detecting the presence and location 
of significant longitudinally or transversely oriented imperfec­
tions; however, sensitivity of the test to various types of 
imperfections is affected by the calibration, and different 
techniques should be employed to detect differently oriented 
imperfections. 
22.3.2.5 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of imperfections that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
22.3.3 Time of Examination: 
22.3.3.1 Nondestructive testing for specification acceptance 
shall be performed after all mechanical processing, heat 
treatments, and straightening operations. This requirement 
does not preclude additional testing at earlier stages in the 
processing. 
22.3.4 Su-rjace Condition: 
22.3.4.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, 
paint, and other foreign material that could interfere with 
interpretation of test results. The methods used for cleaning 
and preparing the surfaces for examination shall not be 
detrimental to the base metal or the surface finish. 
22.3.4.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can 
produce signals that interfere with the test. 
22.3.5 Extent of Examination: 
22.3.5.1 The relative motion of the pipe and the 
transducer(s), coil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire 
pipe surface is scanned, except as allowed by 22.3.5.2. 
22.3.5.2 The existence of end effects is recognized, and the 
extent of such effects shall be detennined by the manufacturer, 
and, if requested, shall be reported to the purchaser. Other 
nondestructive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
22.3.6 Operator Qualifications: 
22.3.6.1 The test unit operator shall be qualified in accor­
dance • with SNT-TC- lA, or an equivalent recognized and 
documented standard. 
22.3.7 Test Conditions: 
22.3.7.1 For eddy-current testing, the excitation coil fre­
quency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration yet 
provide a good signal-to-noise ratio. 
22.3.7.2 The eddy-current coil frequency used shall not 
exceed the following: 
On specified walls up to 0.050 in. [1.3 mm] - 100 kHz 
On specified walls up to 0.150 in. [3.8 mm] - 50 kHz 
On specified walls equal to or greater than 0.150 in. [3.8 mm] - 10 kHz

SA-999 /SA-999M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
22.3.7.3 Ultrasonic-For examination by the ultrasonic 
method, the nominal transducer frequency shall be 2.00 MHz 
or more and the nominal transducer size shall be 1.5 in. [38 
mm] or less. 
22.3.7.4 If the equipment contains a reject notice filter 
setting, this shall remain off during calibration and testing 
unless linearity can be demonstrated at the setting. 
22.3.8 Reference Standards: 
22.3.8.1 Reference standards of convenient length shall be 
prepared from a length of pipe of the same grade, size (NPS, or 
outside diameter and schedule or wall thickness), surface 
finish, and heat treatment conditions as the pipe to be exam­
ined. 
22.3.8.2 For Ultrasonic Testing, the reference ID and OD 
notches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes 
shown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The 
depth of each notch shall not exceed 12.5 % of the specified 
wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is 
the greater. The width of the notch shall not exceed twice the 
depth. Notches shall be placed on both the OD and ID surfaces. 
22.3.8.3 For Eddy-Current Testing, the reference standard 
shall contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following reference discontinuities: 
22.3.8.4 Drilled Hole-The reference standard shall contain 
three or more holes, equally spaced circumferentially around 
the pipe and longitudinally separated by a sufficient distance to 
allow distinct identification of the signal from each hole. The 
holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the pipe 
wall, with care being taken to avoid distortion of the pipe while 
drilling. One hole shall be drilled in the weld, if visible. 
Alternatively, the manufacturer of welded pipe is permitted to 
drill one hole in the weld and run the calibration standard 
through the test coils three times, with the weld turned at 120° 
on each pass. The hole diameter shall not exceed the following: 
NPS Designator Hole Diameter 
½ 0.039 in. [1.0 mm] 
above ½ to 1 ¼ 0.055 in. [1.4 mm] 
above 1 ¼ to 2 0.071 in. [1.8 mm] 
above 2 to 5 0.087 in. [2.2 mm] 
above 5 0.106 In. [2.7 mm] 
22.3.8.5 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool 
or a file with a ¼-in. [6.4-mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed 
or milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the 
longitudinal axis of the pipe. Such a notch shall have a depth 
not exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the 
pipe or 0.004 in. [0.10 mm], whichever is the greater. 
22.3.8.6 Longitudinal Notch-A notch of 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] 
or less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to 
the pipe axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to have a depth 
not exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe 
or 0.004 in. [0.10 mm], whichever is the greater. 
22.3.8.7 More or smaller reference discontinuities, or both, 
may be used by agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
22.3.9 Standardization Procedure: 
22.3.9.1 The test apparatus shall be standardized at the 
beginning and end of each series of pipes of the same size 
(NPS or diameter and schedule or wall thickness), grade and 
heat treatment condition, and at intervals not exceeding 4 h. 
More frequent standardization may be performed at the manu­
facturer's option and may be required upon agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
22.3.9.2 The test apparatus shall also be standardized after 
any change in test system settings, change of operator, equip­
ment repair, or interruption due to power loss, process 
shutdown, or when a problem is suspected. 
22.3.9.3 The reference standard shall be passed through the 
test apparatus at the same speed and test system settings as the 
pipe to be tested. 
22.3.9.4 The signal-to-noise ratio for the reference standard 
shall be 2½ to 1 or greater. Extraneous signals caused by 
identifiable causes such as dings, scratches, dents, straightener 
marks, etc., shall not be considered noise. The rejection 
amplitude shall be adjusted to be at least 50 % of full scale of 
the readout display. 
22.3.9.5 If upon any standardization, the rejection ampli­
tude has decreased by at least 29 % (3 dB) of peak height from 
the last standardization, the pipe tested since the last calibration 
shall be rejected or retested for acceptance after the test 
apparatus settings have been changed, or the transducer(s), 
coil(s), or sensor(s) have been adjusted, and the test apparatus 
has been restandardized. 
22.3.10 Evaluation of Imperfections: 
22.3.10.1 Pipes producing a signal equal to or greater than 
the lowest signal produced by the reference discontinuities 
shall be identified and separated from the acceptable pipes. The 
area producing the signal may be reexamined. 
22.3.10.2 Such pipes shall be rejected if the test signals 
were produced by imperfections that cannot be identified or 
were produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. Such 
pipes may be repaired if such repair is permitted by the 
applicable product specification. To be accepted, a repaired 
pipe shall pass the same nondestructive test by which it was 
rejected, and it shall meet the minimum wall thickness require­
ments of the applicable product specification. 
22.3.10.3 If the test signals were produced by visual imper­
fections such as scratches, surface roughness, dings, straight­
ener marks, cutting chips, steel die stamps, stop marks, or pipe 
reducer ripple, the pipe is permitted to be accepted based upon 
visual examination provided that the depth of the imperfection 
is less than 0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 12.5 % of the specified wall 
thickness, whichever is the greater. 
22.3.10.4 Rejected pipe may be reconditioned and retested, 
provided that the wall thickness is not decreased to less than 
that required by the applicable product specification. The 
outside diameter at the point of grinding may be reduced by the 
amount so removed. To be accepted, retested pipe shall meet 
the test requirement. 
22.3 .10.5 If the imperfection is explored to the extent that it 
can be identified as non-rejectable, the pipe may be accepted 
without further test provided that the imperfection does not 
encroach on the minimum required wall thickness. 
23. Inspection 
23.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry at all times work on the contract of the purchaser is being 
performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's facilities that 
1492 
,.'~

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-999 /SA-999M 
concern the manufacture of the product ordered. The manufac­
turer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities to be 
satisfied that the product is being furnished in accordance with 
this specification. All required tests and inspection shall be 
made at the place of manufacture prior to shipment, unless 
otherwise specified, and shall be conducted so as not to 
interfere unnecessmily with the manufacturer's operations. 
24. Rejection 
24.1 Each length of pipe received from the manufacturer 
may be inspected by the purchaser and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of the specification based upon the inspection and 
test method as outlined in the applicable product specification, 
the length may be rejected and the manufacturer shall be 
notified. Disposition of rejected pipe shall be a matter of 
agreement between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
24.2 Pipe that fails in any of the forming operations or in the 
process of installation and is found to be defective shall be set 
aside and the manufacturer shall be notified for mutual 
evaluation of the suitability of the pipe. Disposition of such 
pipe shall be matter for agreement. 
25. Certification 
25.1 The manufacturer or supplier shall furnish to the 
purchaser a certificate of compliance stating that the product 
was manufactured, sampled, tested, and inspected in accor­
dance with the specification, including year-date, the supple­
mentary requirements, and any other requirements designated 
in the purchase order or contract, and has been found to meet 
such requirements. A signature or notarization is not required; 
however, the document shall be dated and shall clem·ly identify 
the organization submitting it. 
25 .1.1 Notwithstanding the absence of a signature or 
notarization, the certifying organization is responsible for the 
contents of the document. 
25.2 In addition to the certificate of compliance, the manu­
facturer or supplier shall furnish to the purchaser a test report 
that includes the following information and test results, as 
applicable: 
25.2.1 Heat number, 
25.2.2 Heat analysis, 
25.2.3 Product analysis if specified or required, 
25.2.4 Tensile properties, 
25.2.5 Width in the gauge length, if longitudinal strip 
tension test specimens were used, 
25.2.6 Bend test acceptable, 
25.2.7 Flattening test acceptable, 
25.2.8 Hydrostatic test pressure, 
25.2.9 Nondestructive electric test method,

25.2.11 Other test results or information required to be 
reported by the applicable product specification. 
25.3 Test results or information required to be reported by 
supplementary requirements, or other requirements designated 
in the purchase order or contract shall be reported but may be 
reported in a separate document. 
25.4 The test report shall include a statement of explanation 
for the letter added to the specification number marked on the 
tubes (see 26.5) if all of the requirements of the specification 
have not been completed. The purchaser must certify that all 
requirements of the specification have been completed before 
the removal of the letter (that is, X, Y, or Z). 
25.5 A test report, certificate of compliance, or similar 
document printed from or used in electronic form from an 
electronic data interchange (EDI) shall be regarded as having 
the same validity as a counterpart printed in the certifying 
organization's facility. The content of the EDI transmitted 
document shall meet the requirements of the invoked ASTM 
standard(s) and conform to any existing EDI agreement be­
tween the purchaser and the supplier. Notwithstanding the 
absence of a signature, the organization submitting the EDI 
transmission is responsible for its content. 
26. Product Marking 
26.1 Each length of pipe shall be legibly marked with the 
manufacturer's name or brand, the specification number (year 
of issue not required) m1d grade. Marking shall begin approxi­
mately 12 in. [300 mm] from the end of each length of pipe. 
For pipe less than NPS 2 and pipe under 3 ft [1 m] in length, 
the required information may be marked on a tag securely 
attached to the bundle or box in which the pipes are shipped. 
26.2 When pipe marked as specified is rejected, the ASTM 
designation shall be canceled. 
26.3 For austenitic steel pipe, the marking paint or ink shall 
not contain detrimental amounts of harmful metals, or metal 
salts, such as zinc, lead, or copper, which cause conosive 
attack on heating. 
26.4 Pipes that have been weld repaired in accordance with 
17 .1 shall be marked WR. 
26.5 When it is specified that certain requirements of a 
specification adopted by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Committee are to be completed by the purchaser upon receipt 
of the material, the manufacturer shall indicate that all require­
ments of the specification have not been completed by a letter 
such as X, Y, or Z, immediately following the specification 
number. This letter may be removed after completion of all 
requirements in accordance with the specification. An expla­
nation of specification requirements to be completed is pro­
vided in 25. l. 
27. Packaging, Marking, and Loading 
27.1 If specified in the purchase order, packaging, marking, 
and loading for shipment shall be in accordance with the 
procedures of Practices A 700. 
28. Government Procurement 
28.1 If specified in the contract or purchase order, the 
following requirements shall be considered in the inquiry, 
contract, or order for agencies of the U.S. Government where 
scale- free pipe is required. Such requirements shall take 
precedence if there is a conflict between these requirements 
and those of the applicable product specification. 
1493

SA 0 999 /SA-999M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
28.2 Pipe shall be ordered to nominal pipe size (NPS) and 
schedule. Nominal pipe shall be as specified in ANSI B36.10 or 
B36.19. 
28.3 Responsibility for Inspection-Unless otherwise speci­
fied in the contract or purchase order, the manufacturer is 
responsible for the performance of all inspection and test 
requirements specified. The absence of any inspection require­
ments in the specification shall not relieve the contractor of the 
responsibility for ensuring that all products or supplies submit­
ted to the government for acceptance comply with all require­
ments of the contract or purchase order. Sampling inspection, 
as part of the manufacturing operations, is an acceptable 
practice to asceiiain conformance to requirements; however, 
this does not authorize submission of known defective 
material, either indicated or actual, nor does it commit the 
government to accept the material. Except as otherwise speci­
fied in the contract or purchase order, the manufacturer may 
use its own or any other suitable facilities for the performance 
of the inspection and test requirements unless disapproved by 
the purchaser at the time the order is placed. The purchaser 
shall have the right to perform any of the inspections and tests 
set forth if such inspections and tests are deemed necessary to 
ensure that the products confonn to the prescribed require­
ments. 
28.4 Sampling for Flattening and Flaring Test and for 
Visual and Dimensional Examination-Minimum sampling for 
flattening and flaring tests and visual and dimensional exami­
nation shall be as follows: 
Lot Size (Pieces per Lot) Sample Size 
2 to 8 Entire Lot 
9 to 90 8 
91 to 150 12 
151 to 280 19 
281 to 500 21 
501 to 1200 27 
1201 to 3200 35 
3201 to 1 O 000 38 
10 001 to 35 000 46 
In alI cases, the acceptance number is zero and the rejection 
number is one. Rejected lots may be screened and resubmitted 
for visual and dimensional examination. All defective items 
shall be replaced with acceptable items prior to lot acceptance. 
28.5 Sampling for Chemical Analysis-One sample for 
chemical analysis shall be selected from each two pipes chosen 
from each lot. A lot shall be all material poured from one heat. 
28.6 Sampling for Tension and Bend Test-One sample shall 
be taken from each lot. A lot shall consist of all pipe of the 
sante outside diameter and wall thickness manufactured during 
an 8-h shift from the same heat of steel, and heat treated under 
the same conditions of temperature and time in a single charge 
in a batch-type furnace, or heat treated under the same 
condition in a continuous furnace, and presented for inspection 
at the same time. 
28.7 Hydrostatic and Ultrasonic Tests-Each pipe shall be 
tested by the ultrasonic (if specified) and hydrostatic tests. 
28.8 Pipe shall be free from heavy oxide or scale. The 
internal surface of hot finished ferritic steel pipe shall be 
pickled or blast cleaned to a free of scale condition equivalent 
to the CSa2 visual standard in SSPC-SP6. Cleaning shall be 
performed in accordance with a written procedure that has been 
shown to be effective. This procedure shall be available for 
audit. 
28.9 In addition to the marking required by this 
specification, each length of pipe NPS ¼ or larger shall be 
marked, in accordance with FED-STD-183 and MIL-STD- 792, 
with the nominal pipe size, schedule number, length, and heat 
number or lot identification number. 
28.10 Pipe shall be straight to within the tolerance given in 
Table 2. 
28.11 If specified, each pipe shall be ultrasonically exam­
ined in accordance with MIL-STD-271, except that the notch 
depth in the reference standard shall be 5 % of the wall 
thickness or 0.005 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is the greater. Any 
pipe that produces an indication equal to or greater than 100 % 
of the indication from the reference discontinuity shall be 
rejected. 
28.12 The pipe shall be free from repair welds, welded 
joints, laps, laminations, seams, visible cracks, tears, grooves, 
slivers, pits, and other imperfections detrimental to the pipe as 
determined by visual and ultrasonic examination, or alternate 
tests, as specified. 
28.13 Pipe shall be uniform in quality and condition and 
have a finish conforming to the best practice for standard 
quality pipe. Surface imperfections such as handling marks, 
straightening marks, light mandrel and die marks, shallow pits, 
and scale pattern will not be considered defects if the imper­
fections are removable within the tolerances specified for wall 
thickness or 0.005 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is the greater. The 
bottom of imperfections shall be visible and the profile shall be 
rounded and faired-in. 
28.14 No weld repair by the manufacturer is permitted. 
28.15 Preservation shall be level A or commercial, and 
packing shall be level A, B, or commercial, as specified. Level 
A preservation and level A or B packing shall be in accordance 
with MIL-STD-163 and commercial preservation and packing 
shall be in accordance with Practices A700 or Practice D3951.

Xl. MINIMUM WALL THICKNESS ON INSPECTION FOR NOMINAL (AVERAGE) PIPE WALL THICKNESS 
TABLE X1.1 Minimum Wall Thicknesses on Inspection for Nominal (Average) Pipe Wall Thicknesses 
NoTE 1-The following equation, upon which this table is based, may be applied to calculate minimum wall thickness from nominal (average) wall 
thickness: 
t,, X 0.875 = tm 
where: 
t,, = nominal (average) wall thickness, in. [nun], and 
t,,, = minimum wall thicknesses, in. [nun], 
The wall thickness in inch-pound units is rounded to three decimal places in accordance with the rounding method of Practice E29. The wall thickness 
in SI units is rounded to one decimal place in accordance with the rounding method of Practice E29. 
NoTE 2-This table is a master table cove1ing wall thicknesses available in the purchase of different classifications of pipe, but it is not meant to imply 
that all of the walls listed herein are necessaiily obtainable for the applicable product specification.

rolling) is stored for some time. 
3.2.1.1 Discussion-Aging increases the tendency of a steel 
to exhibit stretcher strains and fluting. 
3.2.2 Bake Hardenable Steel (BHS), n-steel in which 
significant aging is realized when moderate heat treatment, 
such as that used for paint baking, follows straining or cold 
working. 
3.2.3 Full Hard Steel (FHS), n-steel that is cold reduced 
and exhibits a microstructure consisting of non-recrystallized 
grains.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-1008/SA-1008M (ASTM A1008/A1008M} 
3.2.4 inclusion control, n-the process of reducing the 
volume fraction of inclusions or modifying the shape of 
inclusions to improve formability, weldability, and machinabil­
ity. 
3.2.4.1 Discussion-Inclusions, especially those elongated 
during the rolling process, create the conditions for initiating or 
propagating cracks, or both, when the material is stretched or 
bent during the manufacture of a part. The adverse effects of 
inclusions are minimized by reducing the content of inclusions 
in the steel or by altering the shape of inclusions, or both, 
through the use of additions during the steelmaking process 
that change the elongated shape of the inclusions to less 
harmful small, well dispersed globular inclusions. 
3.2.5 Required Hardness Steel (RHS), n-steel that adheres 
to a specified hardness range, at the time of shipment; may also 
be referenced as Specified Hardness Steel. 
3.2.5.1 Discussion-Chemical composition shall be deter­
mined by the producer unless there is prior agreement between 
producer and user, or seller and buyer. 
3.2.6 Solid-solution Hardened Steel or Solution Hardened 
Steel (SHS), n-steel strengthened through additions of 
elements, such as Mn, P, or Si, that can be dissolved within the 
crystalline structure of steels. 
3.2.6.1 Discussion-Alloying elements that form a solid­
solution with iron provide strengthening as a result of local 
distortions in atomic arrangements, which arise as a result of 
the mismatch between the atomic sizes of such elements and 
that of iron. 
3.2.7 Special Forming Steel (SFS), n-steel ordered to 1010 
chemistry or greater levels of carbon, manganese or both, 
which exhibits enhanced formability or mechanical properties. 
3.2.7.1 Discussion-Steel grades such as CS -1010 or CS -
1020 for example, adhere to chemistry requirements only, 
whereas SFS - 1010 or SFS - 1020, also provide enhanced 
formability. Due to greater carbon content, SFS - 1020 is not 
as formable as SFS - 1010. 
3.2.8 stabilization, n-addition of one or more nitride- or 
carbide-forming elements, or both, such as titanium and 
columbium, to control the level of the interstitial elements of 
carbon and nitrogen in the steel. 
3.2.8.1 Discussion-Stabilizing improves formability and 
increases resistance to aging. 
3.2.9 vacuum degassing, n-process of refining liquid steel 
in which the liquid is exposed to a vacuum as part of a special 
technique for removing impurities or for decarburizing the 
steel.

A When copper is specified, the copper limit is a minimum requirement. When copper steel is not specified, the copper limit is a maximum requirement. 
8 Columbium (Cb) and niobium (Nb) are considered interchangeable names for Element 41 in the periodic table and both names are acceptable for use. 
c There is no specified limit, but the analysis shall be reported. 
0 HSLAS and HSLAS-F steels contain the strengthening elements coiumbium (niobium), vanadium, titanium, and molybdenum added singly or in combination. The 
minimum requirements only apply to the microalloy elements selected for strengthening of the steel. 
e The purchaser has the option of restricting the nitrogen content. It should be noted that, depending on the microalloying scheme (for example, use of vanadium) of the 
producer, nitrogen may be a deliberate addition. Consideration should be made for the use of nitrogen binding elements (for example, vanadium, titanium). 
F For carbon levels less than or equal to 0.02 % vanadium, columbium, or titanium, or a combination thereof, are permitted to be used as stabilizing elements at the 
producer's option. In such cases, the applicable limit for vanadium and columbium shall be 0.1 0 % max., and the limit for titanium shall be 0.15 % max. 
0.008 %, report the analysis as <0.008 % or the actual deter­
mined value. When the amount of boron is less than 0.0005 %, 
report the analysis as <0.0005 % or the actual determined 
value. 
7.3 Sheet steel grades defined by this specification are 
suitable for welding if appropriate welding conditions are 
selected. For certain welding processes, if more restrictive 
composition limits are desirable, they shall be specified at the 
time of inquiry and confirmed at the time of ordering. 
8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 CS, DS, DDS, and EDDS: 
8.1.1 Typical nonmandatory mechauical properties for CS, 
DS, DDS, EDDS, and Specification A568/A568M Table X2.3 
are shown in Table 3. 
8.1.2 The material represented by all grades specified in 
Table 1 and Specification A568/A568M Table X2.3 shall be 
capable of being bent, at room temperature, in any direction 
through 180° flat on itself without cracking on the outside of 
the bent portion (see Section 14 of Test Methods and Defini­
tions A370). The bend test is not a requirement of delivery. 
However, if testing is performed by the purchaser, material not 
conforming to the requirement shall be subject to rejection. 
8.1.3 Sheet of these designations except for EDDS are 
subject to aging dependent upon processing factors such as the 
method of annealing (continuous annealing or box annealing), 
and chemical composition. For additional information on 
aging, see Appendix Xl of Specification A568/A568M. 
8.1.4 EDDS steel is stabilized to be nonaging and so is not 
subject to stretcher strains and fluting. Other steels are pro­
cessed to be nonaging; please consult your supplier. 
8.2 SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, SHS, and BHS: 
8.2.1 The available strength grades for SS, HSLAS and 
HSLAS-F are shown in Table 4. 
8.2.2 The available strength grades for SHS and BHS are 
shown in Table 5.

8 For coil products, testing by the producer is limited to the end of the coil. Mechanical properties throughout the coil shall comply with the minimum values specified. 
testing is performed on a per-coil basis, only one test shall be 
made for each master coil. 
(1) Requirements specified in 8.2.3.2 are minimum testing 
requirements. Additional testing may be performed at the 
producer's option, or upon agreement between producer and 
user or seller and purchaser. 
(2) Testing of non-strength required grades may also be 
performed as described in 8.2.3.2, for each specific non­
strength grade ordered. 
8.2.3.3 Tension test specimens shall be taken at a point 
immediately adjacent to the material to be qualified. 
8.2.3.4 Tension test specimens shall be taken from the full 
thickness of the sheet. 
8.2.3.5 Tension test specimens shall be taken from a loca­
tion approximately halfway between the center of the sheet and 
the edge of the material as rolled. 
8.2.3.6 Tension test samples shall be taken with the length­
wise axis of the test specimen parallel to the rolling direction 
(longitudinal test). 
8.2.3.7 Test Method-Yield strength shall be determined by 
either the 0.2 % offset method or the 0.5 % extension under 
load method unless otherwise specified. 
8.2.3.8 Bake hardenable steel shall conform to bake hard­
ening index requirements included in Table 5 for the grade 
specified. The method for measuring the bake hardening index 
is described in Annex Al. Bake hardenable steel shall exhibit 
a minimum increase in yield strength of 4 ksi [25 MPa] as 
based on the upper yield point or 3 ksi [20 MPa] as based on 
the lower yield stress, after a prestrained specimen has been 
exposed to a standard bake cycle (340 °F [170 °C]) for 20 min. 
8.2.4 Bending Properties: 
8.2.4.l The suggested minimum inside radii for cold bend­
ing are listed in Appendix Xl and is discussed in more detail 
in Specification A568/A568M (Section 6). Where a tighter 
bend radius is required, where curved or offset bends are 
involved, or where stretching or drawing are also a 
consideration, the producer shall be consulted. 
8.3 RHS and FHS: 
8.3.1 The available hardness grades for RHS and FHS are 
shown in Table 6. 
8.3.2 The steel represented by RHS grades and FHS shall 
meet the specified hardness shown in Table 6, as determined at 
the time of shipment. 
8.3.2.1 Based on chemistry and processing parameters such 
as method of annealing ( continuous or box annealing), and 
rolling practice, RHS grades may be subject to aging and 
potentially exhibit greater hardness when tested at a later date. 
8.3.2.2 Due to the non-recrystallized microstructure, FHS is 
not expected to be subject to aging. 
8.3.3 Hardness testing shall be performed by the producer, 
at the final processing step, prior to shipment, at a location not 
less than 1 in. [25 mm] from the edge of the sheet. 
9. Finish and Appearance 
9.1 Surface Finish: 
9.1.1 Unless otherwise specified, the sheet shall have a 
matte finish. When required, specify the appropriate surface 
texture and condition. For additional information, see the 
Finish and Condition section of Specification A568/A568M 
(may not apply when steel is ordered full hard (FHS), since the 
final process step is typically the cold reduction mill). For 
additional information see "Finish and Condition" section of 
Specification A568/ A568M. 
9.2 Oiling: 
9.2.1 Unless otherwise specified, the sheet shall be oiled 
(may not apply when steel is ordered full hard (FHS), since the 
final process step is typically the cold reduction mill). 
9.2.2 When required, specify the sheet to be furnished not 
oiled (dry). 
10. Retests and Disposition of Non-Conforming Material 
10.1 Retests, conducted with the requirements of Subsec­
tion 11.1 of Specification A568/ A568M, are permitted when an 
unsatisfactory test result is suspected to be the consequence of 
the test method procedure. 
10.2 Disposition of non-conforming material shall be sub­
ject to the requirements of Subsection 11.2 of Specification 
A568/ A568M.

(Mandatory Information) 
Al. BAKE HARDENABLE STEELS 
Al.1 Determination of Bake Hardening Index 
Al .1.1 The bake hardening index (BHI) is determined by a 
two-step procedure using a standard longitudinal (rolling 
direction) tensile-test specimen, prepared in accordance with 
Test Methods and Definitions A370. The test specimen is first 
strained in tension. The magnitude of this tensile "pre-strain" 
shall be 2 % (extension under load). The test specimen is then 
removed from the test machine and baked at a temperature of 
340 °F [170 °C] for a period of 20 min. Referring to Fig. Al.I, 
the bake hardening index (BHI) of the material is calculated as 
follows: 
BHI= B-A (Al.1) 
where: 
A = flow stress at 2 % extension under load, and 
B = yield strength [upper yield strength (Bu) or lower yield 
strength (BL)] after baking at 340 °F [170 °C] for 
20 min. 
Al.1.2 The original test specimen cross section (width and 
thickness) is used in the calculation of all engineering strengths 
in this test. 
Al.1.3 The pre-straining of 2 % in tension is intended to 
simulate a modest degree of forming strain, while the subse­
quent baking is intended to simulate a paint-curing or similar 
treatment. In the production of actual parts, forming strains and 
baking treatments can differ from those employed here, and as 
a result, final properties can differ from the values obtained 
under these controlled conditions.

NOTE 1-The hardness values shown are at the time of shipment. 
NOTE 2-Test for hardness shall be conducted in accordance with the 
requirements of Test Methods El 8. 
Norn 3-The hardness values are Rockwell B scale as measured or 
converted from the appropriate Rockwell scales. 
Norn 4--The typical hardness values apply to the full range of steel 
sheet thickness. Hardness tends to increase as the steel sheet thickness 
decreases. 
NOTE 5-Hardness testing is commonly used to assess the relative 
formability of various designations of uncoated steel sheet. This assess­
ment done by many users is recognized to be only an approximation of the 
relative formability and therefore cannot be used as a specification 
requirement.

[Identical with ASTM Specification A 1010/AlOlOM-01(2009) except for an editorial correction to a column heading in Table 2.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers martensitic stainless steels 
for various structural, architectural, pressure vessel, and 
heat-resisting applications. The mechanical properties of 
these steels are customarily, but not necessarily, developed 
by a suitable heat treatment generally referred to as tem­
pering. 
1.2 Steel products under this specification are available 
in two grades: 
Grade 
40 [275) 
50 [350] 
Yield Strength, min, ksi 
[MPa] 
40 [275) 
50 [350) 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only 
by the capacity of the composition to meet the specified 
mechanical property requirements; however, current prac­
tice normally limits the maximum thickness of plates fur­
nished under this specification to 1 in. [25 mm]. 
1.4 The values stated in inch-pound or SI units are to 
be regarded separately as the standard. Within the text, SI 
units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
must be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in nonconformance with 
the specification. The inch-pound units shall apply unless 
the "M" designation of this specification is specified in the 
purchase order.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions-For definitions of other terms used in this 
specification refer to Terminology A941. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.1 aging, n-loss of ductility with an increase in 
hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength that occurs when 
steel, which has been slightly cold worked (such as by temper 
rolling) is stored for some time. 
3.2.1.1 Discussion-Aging also increases the tendency to­
ward stretcher strains and fluting. 
3.2.2 inclusion control, n-the process of reducing the 
volume fraction of inclusions or modifying the shape of 
inclusions to improve formability, weldability, and machinabil­
ity. 
3.2.2.1 Discussion-Inclusions, especially those elongated 
during the rolling process, create the conditions for initiating or 
propagating cracks when the material is stretched or bent 
during the manufacture of a part (or both). The adverse effects 
of inclusions are minimized by reducing the content of 
inclusions in the steel or by altering the shape of inclusions 
through the use of additions during the steelmaking process 
that change the elongated shape of the inclusions to less 
harmful small, well dispersed globular inclusions (or both).

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-1011/SA-1011M (ASTM A1011/A1011M) 
3.2.3 stabilization, n-addition of one or more nitride or 
carbide forming elements, or both, such as titanium and 
columbium, to control the level of the interstitial elements 
carbon and nitrogen in the steel. 
3.2.3.1 Discussion-Stabilization improves formability and 
increases resistance to aging. 
3.2.4 vacuum degassing, n-process of refining liquid steel 
in which the liquid is exposed to a vacuum as part of a special 
technique for removing impurities or for decarburizing the 
steel. 
3.2.5 Special Forming Steel (SFS), n-Steel ordered to 1010 
chemistry or greater levels of carbon, manganese or both, 
which exhibits enhanced formability or mechanical properties. 
3.2.5.1 Discussion-Steel grades such as CS - 1010 or CS -
1020 for example, adheres to chemistry requirements only, 
whereas SFS - 1010 or SFS - 1020, also provide enhanced 
formability. Due to greater carbon content, SFS - 1020 is not 
as formable as SFS - 1010. 
4. Classification 
4.1 Hot-rolled steel sheet and steel strip is available in the 
following designations: 
4.1.1 Commercial Steel (CS Types A, B, C, and D, as

4.1.3 Drawing Steel (DS Types A and B, as specified in 
Table 1), 
4.1.4 Drawing Steel (DS Types A and B combined with 
chemistry grade in accordance with Specification A568/ 
A568M Table X2.3, 
4.1.5 Commercial Steel Chemistry grade in accordance with 
Specification A568/ A568M Table X2.1, with no type specified 
(CS - 1005, CS - 1008, CS - 1020, and so forth), 
4.1.6 Special Forming Steel (SFS), chemistry as specified in 
Table 1 with carbon & manganese limits in accordance with 
Specification A568/A568M Tables X2 . l or X2.2 (examples: 
SFS - 1010, SFS - 1020, SFS - C 0.12-0.18 % & Mn 
0.50-0 .80 %). 
4.1.7 Structural Steel (SS grades 30[205], 33[230], 36[250] 
Types 1 and 2, 40[275], 45[310] Types 1 and 2, 50[340], 
55[380], 60[410], and 70[480]. 
4.1.8 High-Strength Low-Alloy Steel (HSLAS, classes 1 
and 2, in grades 45[310], 50[340], 55[380], 60[410], 65[450], 
and 70[480]. 
4.1.9 High-Strength Low-Alloy Steel with Improved Form­
ability (HSLAS-F grades 50[340], 60[410], 70[480], and 
80[550]). 
4.1.9.1 HSLAS-F steel has improved formability when 
compared to HSLAS. The steel is fully deoxidized, made to a 
fine grain practice, and includes microalloying elements such 
as columbium, vanadium, and zirconium. The steel shall be 
treated to achieve inclusion control. 
4.1.10 Ultra-High Strength (UHSS Types 1 and 2, in Grades 
90 [620] and 100 [690]). 
4.1.10.1 UHSS steel has increased strength compared with 
HSLAS-F. The steel is killed and made to a fine ferritic grain 
practice, and includes microalloying elements such as colum­
bium (niobium), titanium, vanadium, molybdenum, and so 
forth. The steel shall be treated to achieve inclusion control. 
The material is intended for miscellaneous applications where 
higher strength, savings in weight, and weldability are impor­
tant. Atmospheric corrosion resistance of these steels is equiva­
lent to plain carbon steels. With copper specified, the atmo­
spheric corrosion resistance is somewhat enhanced. 
4.1.11 When required for HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS 
steels, limitations on the use of one or more of the microalloy 
elements shall be specified on the order.

A The yield strength tends to increase and the elongation tends to decrease as the 
sheet thickness decreases. These properties represent those typical of material in 
the thickness range of 0.100 to 0.150 in. [2.5 to 3.5 mm] for CS Types A, B, and 
DS Types A and Band in the thickness ranges of 0.060 to 0.075 in. (1.5 to 1.9 mm] 
for CS Type D. 
8 The typical mechanical property values presented here are nonmandatory. They 
are provided to assist the purchaser in specifying a suitable steel for a given 
application. Values outside these ranges are to be expected. 
0 Yield strength and elongation are measured in the longitudinal direction in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
8.2.1.1 For SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS, a report is 
required of mechanical properties as determined by the tension 
test. 
8.2.2 Tension Tests: 
8.2.2.1 Requirements-Material as represented by the test 
specimen shall conform to the mechanical property require­
ments specified in Table 4. These requirements do not apply to 
the uncropped ends of unprocessed coils. 
8.2.2.2 Number of Tests-Two tension tests shall be made 
from each heat or from each 50 tons [45 000 kg]. When the 
amount of finished material from a heat is less than 50 tons 
[45 000 kg], one tension test shall be made. When material 
rolled from one heat differs 0.050 in. [1.27 mm] or more in 
thickness, one tension test shall be made from the thickest and 
thinnest material regardless of the weight represented. 
8.2.2.3 Tension test specimens shall be taken at a point 
immediately adjacent to the material to be qualified. 
8.2.2.4 Tension test specimens shall be taken from the full 
thickness of the sheet as-rolled. 
8.2.2.5 Tension test specimens shall be taken from a loca­
tion approximately halfway between the center of sheet and the 
edge of the material as-rolled. 
8.2.2.6 Tension test specimens shall be taken with the 
lengthwise axis of the test specimen parallel to the rolling 
direction (longitudinal test). 
8.2.2.7 Test Method-Yield strength shall be determined by 
either the 0.2 % offset method or the 0.5 % extension under 
load method unless otherwise specified. 
8.2.3 Bending Properties: 
8.2.3.1 The suggested minimum inside radii for cold bend­
ing are listed in Appendix Xl and is discussed in more detail 
in Specifications A568/A568M (6.6) and A749/A749M (7.6). 
Where a tighter bend radius is required, where curved or offset 
bends are involved, or where stretching or drawing are also a 
consideration, the producer shall be consulted. 
9. Finish and Appearance 
9.1 Surface Finish: 
9.1.1 Unless otherwise specified, the material shall be fur­
nished as rolled, that is, without removing the hot-rolled oxide 
or scale. 
9.1.2 When required, it is permissible to specify that the 
material be pickled or blast cleaned (descaled). 
9.2 Oiling: 
9.2.1 Unless otherwise specified, as-rolled material shall be 
furnished not oiled (that is, dry), and pickled or blast cleaned 
material shall be furnished oiled. 
9.3 Edges: 
9.3.1 Steel sheet is available with mill edge or cut edge. 
9.3.2 Steel strip is available with mill edge or cut edge. 
10. Retests and Disposition of Non-Conforming Material 
10.1 Retests, conducted. in accordance with the require­
ments of Section 11.1 of Specification A568/ A568M, are 
permitted when an unsatisfactorily test result is suspected to be 
the consequence of the test method procedure. 
10.2 Disposition of non-conforming material shall be sub­
ject to the requirements of Section 11.2 of Specification 
A568/ A568M. 
11. Product Marking 
11.1 In addition to the requirements of Specification A568/ 
A568M for sheet and Specification A749/A749M for strip, 
each lift or coil shall be marked with the designation shown on 
theorder(CS (Type A, B, orC), OS (TypeAorB), SFS (Grade, 
Carbon or Manganese or both), SS (Grade and for SS36, Type), 
HSLAS (Grade and Class), HSLAS-F (Grade), or UHSS (Type 
and Grade)). The designation shall be legibly stenciled on the 
top of each lift or shown on a tag attached to each coil or 
shipping unit.

1.2 In the case of conflict between a requirement of a 
product specification and a requirement of this general require­
ments specification, the product specification shall prevail. In 
the case of conflict between a requirement of the product 
specification or a requirement of this general requirements 
specification and a more stringent requirement of the purchase 
order, the purchase order shall prevail. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the

5. l.12 Special requirements or any supplementary 
requirements, or both. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 Chemical Analysis-Samples for chemical analysis, and 
method of analysis, shall be in accordance with Test Methods, 
Practices, and Terminology A751. 
6.2 Heat Analysis-An analysis of each heat of steel shall be 
made by the steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of 
the elements specified. If secondary melting processes are 
employed, the heat analysis shall be obtained from one 
remelted ingot or the product of one remelted ingot of each 
primary melt. The chemical composition thus determined, or 
that determined from a product analysis made by the tubular 
product manufacturer, shall conform to the requirements speci­
fied in the product specification. 
6.2.1 For steels ordered under product specifications refer­
encing this specification of general requirements, the steel shall 
not contain an unspecified element, other than nitrogen for 
stainless steels, for the ordered grade to the extent that the steel 
conforms to the requirements of another grade for which that 
element is a specified element having a required minimum 
content. For this requirement, a grade is defined as an alloy 
described individually and identified by its own UNS designa­
tion in a table of chemical requirements within any specifica­
tion listed within the scope as being covered by this specifi­
cation. 
6.3 Product Analysis-Product analysis requirements and 
options, if any, shall be as contained in the product specifica­
tion. 
7. Tensile Properties 
7 .1 The material shall conform to the tensile property 
requirements prescribed in the individual product specification. 
7 .2 The yield strength, when specified, shall be determined 
corresponding to a permanent offset of 0.2 % of the gauge 
length or to a total extension of 0.5 % of the gauge length under 
load. 
7.3 If the percentage of elongation of any test specimen is 
less than that specified and any part of the fracture is more than 
¾ in. [19.0 mm] from the center of the gauge length, as 
indicated by scribe marks on the specimen before testing, a 
retest shall be allowed. 
8. Standard Mass per Unit Length 
8.1 The calculated mass per foot, based upon a specified 
minimum wall thickness, shall be determined by the following 
equation (see Note 1): 
W= C(D- t)t (I) 
where: 
C = 10.69 [0.0246615], 
W = mass per unit length, lb/ft [kg/m], 
D = specified outside diameter, in. [mm], and 
t = specified minimum wall thickness, in. [mm]. 
Norn 1-The calculated masses given by Eq I are based on the masses 
for carbon steel tubing. The mass of tubing made of ferritic stainless steels 
may be up to about 5 % less, and that made of austenitic stainless steel up 
to about 2 % greater than the values given. Mass of ferritic/austenitic 
(duplex) stainless steel will be intermediate to the mass of fully austenitic 
and fully ferritic stainless steel tubing. 
8.2 The permitted variations from the calculated mass per 
foot [kilogran1 per metre] shall be as prescribed in Table L 
9. Permitted Variations in Wall Thickness 
9.1 Variations from the specified minimum wall thickness 
shall not exceed the amounts prescribed in Table 2. 
9.2 For tubes 2 in. [50 mm] and over in outside diameter and 
0.220 in. [5.6 mm] and over in thickness, the variation in wall 
thickness in any one cross section of any one tube shall not 
exceed the following percentage of the actual mean wall at the 
section. The actual mean wall is defined as the average of the 
thickest and thinnest wall in that section. 
Seamless tubes ±10 % 
Welded tubes ±5 % 
9.3 When cold-finished tubes as ordered require wall thick­
nesses¾ in. [19.1 mm] or over, or an inside diameter 60 % or 
less of the outside diameter, the permitted variations in wall 
thickness for hot-finished tubes shall apply. 
10. Permitted Variations in Outside Diameter 
10.1 Except as provided in 10.2.l, 10.3, and 25.10.4, 
variations from the specified outside diameter shall not exceed 
the amounts prescribed in Table 3. 
10.2 Thin-wall tubes usually develop significant ovality 
(out-of-roundness) during final annealing, or straightening, or 
both. Thin-wall tubes are defined as those with a specified wall 
3 % or less than the specified OD, or with a wall specified as 
0.020 in. [0.5 mm] or less. 
10.2.1 1 The diameter tolerances of Table 3 are not suffi­
cient to provide for additional ovality expected in thin-wall 
.tubes, and, for such tubes, are applicable only to the mean of 
the extreme (maximum and minimum) outside diameter read­
ings in any one cross section. However, for thin wall tubes the 
difference in extreme outside diameter readings (ovality) in any 
one cross section shall not exceed the following ovality 
allowances:

A Except as provided in 10.2 and 10.3, these permitted variations include 
out-of-roundness. These permitted variations in outside diameter apply to hot­
finished seamless, welded and cold-finished seamless tubes before other fabri­
cating operations such as upsetting, swaging, expanding, bending, or polishing. 
10.3 For cold-finished seamless austenitic and ferritic/ 
austenitic tubes, an ovality allowance is necessary for all sizes 
less than 2 in. [50.8 mm] outside diameter, because they are 
likely to become out of round during their final heat treatment. 
For such tubes, the maximum and minimum outside diameter 
at any cross section shall not deviate from the nominal 
diameter by more than ±0.010 in. [±0.25 mm]. However, the 
mean diameter at that cross section must still be within the 
given permitted variation given in Table 3. In the event of 
conflict between the provisions of 10.2.1 and those of 10.3, the 
larger value of ovality tolerance shall apply. 
10.4 When the specified wall is 2 % or less of the specified 
OD, the method of measurement is per agreement between 
purchaser and manufacturer (see Note 2). 
Nom 2-Very thin wall tubing may not be stiff enough for the outside 
diameter to be accurately measured with a point contact method, such as 
with the use of a micrometer or caliper. When very thin walls are 
specified, "go" - "no go" ring gauges are commonly used to measure 
diameters of 1 ½ in. [38.1 mm] or less. A 0.002 in. [0.05 mm] additional 
tolerance is usually added on the "go" ring gauge to allow clearance for 
sliding. On larger diameters, measurement is commonly performed with a 
pi tape. Other methods, such as optical methods, may also be considered. 
11. Permitted Variations in Length 
11.1 Variations from the specified length shall not exceed 
the amounts prescribed in Table 4. 
12. Permitted Variations in Height of Flash on Electric­
Resistance-Welded Tubes 
12.1 For tubes over 2 in. [50.8 mm] in outside diameter, or 
over 0.135 in. [3.44 mm] in wall thickness, the flash on the 
inside of the tubes shall be mechanically removed by cutting to 
a maximum height of 0.010 in. [0.25 mm] at any point on the 
tube. 
12.2 For tubes 2 in. [50.8 mm] and under in outside 
diameter and 0.135 in. [3.44 mm] and under in wall thickness, 
the flash on the inside of the tube shall be mechanically 
removed by cutting to a maximum height of 0.006 in. [0.15 
mm] at any point on the tube. 
13. Straightness and Finish 
13.1 Finished tubes shall be reasonably straight and have 
smooth ends free of burrs. They shall have a workmanlike 
finish. It is permitted to remove surface imperfections by 
grinding, provided that a smooth curved surface is maintained, 
and the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that 
permitted by this or the product specification, or the purchase 
order. The outside diameter at the point of grinding may be 
reduced by the amount so removed. 
14. Repair by Welding 
14.1 Repair welding of base metal defects in tubing is 
permitted only with the approval of the purchaser and with the 
further understanding that the tube shall be marked "WR" and 
the composition of the deposited filler metal shall be suitable 
for the composition being welded. Defects shall be thoroughly 
chipped or ground out before welding and each repaired length 
shall be reheat treated or stress relieved as required by the 
applicable specification. Each length of repaired tube shall be 
examined by a nondestructive test as required by the product 
specification. 
14.2 Repair welding shall be performed using procedures 
and welders or welding operators that have been qualified in 
accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
Section IX.

15. Retests 
15.1 If the results of the mechanical tests of any group or lot 
do not conform to the requirements specified in the individual 
specification, retests may be made on additional tubes of 
double the original number from the same group or lot, each of 
which shall conform to the requirements specified. 
16. Reheat Treatment 
16.1 If the individual tubes or the tubes selected to represent 
any group or lot fail to conform to the test requirements, the 
individual tubes or the group or lot represented may be reheat 
treated and resubmitted for test. Not more than two reheat 
treatments shall be permitted. 
17. Test Specimens 
17 .1 Test specimens shall be taken from the ends of finished 
tubes prior to upsetting, swaging, expanding, or other fanning 
operations, or being cut to length. They shall be smooth on the 
ends and free of bmTs and flaws. 
17 .2 If any test specimen shows flaws or defective 
machining, it may be discarded and another specimen substi­
tuted. 
18. Method of Mechanical Testing 
18. l The specimens and mechanical tests required shall be 
made in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370 
or Test Methods A1058. 
18.1.1 Unless otherwise specified in the ordering 
requirements, Test Methods AI058 shall apply when the metric 
version of the product specification is specified. 
18.2 Specimens shall be tested at room temperature. 
18.3 Small or subsize specimens as described in Test 
Methods and Definitions A370 or Test Methods A1058 may be 
used only when there is insufficient material to prepare one of 
the standard specimens. When using small or subsize 
specimens, the largest one possible shall be used. 
19. Flattening Test 
19.1 A section of tube not less than 2½ in. [60 mm] in 
length for seamless tubes and not less than 4 in. [IO0 mm] in 
length for welded tubes and for heavily cold-worked tubes 
shall be flattened cold between parallel plates in two steps. For 
welded tubes, the weld shall be placed 90° from the direction 
of the applied force (at a point of maximum bending). During 
the first step, which is a test for ductility, no cracks or breaks, 
except as provided for in 19.4, on the inside, outside, or end 
smfaces shall occur in seamless tubes, or on the inside or 
outside surfaces of welded tubes and heavily cold-worked 
tubes, until the distance between the plates is less than the 
value of H calculated by the following equation: 
(1 +e)t 
H=e+t!D (2) 
where: 
H = distance between flattening plates, in. [mm], 
= specified wall thickness of the tube, in. [mm], 
D = specified outside diameter of the tube, in. [mm], and 
e = deformation per unit length ( constant for a given grade 
of steel: 0.07 for medium-carbon steel (maximum 
specified carbon 0.19 % or greater), 0.08 for ferritic 
alloy steel, 0.09 for austenitic steel, 0.09 for duplex 
(ferritic/austenitic) stainless steels, and 0.09 for low­
carbon steel (maximum specified carbon 0.18 % or 
less)). 
During the second step, which is a test for soundness, the 
flattening shall be continued until the specimen breaks or the 
opposite walls of the specimen meet. Evidence of laminated or 
unsound material, or of incomplete weld that is revealed dming 
the entire flattening test shall be cause for rejection. 
19.2 Surface imperfections in the test specimens before 
flattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening 
test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements. 
19.3 Superficial ruptures resulting from surface imperfec­
tions shall not be cause for rejection. 
19.4 When low D-to-t ratio tubular products are tested, 
because the strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably 
high on the inside surface at the six and twelve o'clock 
locations, cracks at these locations shall not be cause for 
rejection if the D-to-t ratio is less than 10. 
20. Reverse Flattening Test 
20.1 A section 4 in. [100 mm] in length of finished welded 
tubing in sizes down to and including ½ in. [12.7 mm] in 
outside diameter shall be split longitudinally 90° on each side 
of the weld and the sample opened and flattened with the weld 
at the point of maximum bend. There shall be no evidence of 
cracks or lack of penetration or overlaps resulting from flash 
removal in the weld. 
21. Reverse Bend Test 
21.1 A section 4 in. [100 mm] minimum in length shall be 
split longitudinally 90° on each side of the weld. The sanlple 
shall then be opened and bent around a mandrel with a 
maximum thickness of four times the wall thickness, with the 
mandrel parallel to the weld and against the original outside 
surface of the tube. The weld shall be at the point of maximum 
bend. There shall be no evidence of cracks or of overlaps 
resulting from the reduction in thickness of the weld area by 
cold working. When the geometry or size of the tubing make it 
difficult to test the sample as a single piece, the sample may be 
sectioned into smaller pieces provided a minimum of 4 in. of 
weld is subjected to reverse bending. 
21.2 The reverse bend test is not applicable when the wall is 
10 % or more of the specified outside diameter, or the wall 
thickness is 0.134 in. [3.4 mm] or greater, or the outside 
diameter is less than 0.375 in. [9.5 mm]. Under these 
conditions, the reverse flattening test shall apply. 
22. Flaring Test 
22.1 A section of tube approximately 4 in. [100 mm] in 
length shall stand being flared with a tool having a 60° included 
angle until the tube at the mouth of the flare has been expanded 
1530

=== Page 1585 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-1016/SA-1016M 
to the percentages specified in Table 5 without cracking or 
showing imperfections rejectable under the provisions of the 
product specification. 
23. Flange Test 
23.1 A section of tube shall be capable of having a flange 
turned over at a right angle to the body of the tube without 
cracking or showing imperfections rejectable under the provi­
sions of the product specification. The width of the flange for 
carbon and alloy steels shall be not less than the percentages 
specified in Table 6. For the austenitic grades, the width of the 
flange for all sizes listed in Table 6 shall be not less than 15 %. 
24. Hardness Test 
24.1 For tubes with wall thickness 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] or 
over, either the Brinell or Rockwell hardness test shall be used. 
When Brinell hardness testing is used, a 10-mm ball with 3000, 
1500, or 500-kg load, or a 5-mm ball with 750-kg load shall be 
used, at the option of the manufacturer. 
24.2 For tubes with wall thickness 0.065 in. [1.7 mm] or 
over but less than 0.200 in. [5.1 mm], the Rockwell hardness 
test shall be used. 
24.3 For tubes with wall thickness less than 0.065 in. [1.7 
mm], the hardness test shall not be required. 
24.4 The Brinell hardness test shall, at the option of the 
manufacturer, be made on the outside of the tube near the end, 
on the outside of a specimen cut from the tube, or on the wall 
cross section of a specimen cut from the tube. This test shall be 
made so that the distance from the center of the impression to 
the edge of the specimen is at least 2.5 times the diameter of 
the impression. 
24.5 The Rockwell hardness test shall, at the option of the 
manufacturer, be made on the inside surface, on the wall cross 
section, or on a flat on. the outside surface. 
24.6 For tubes furnished with upset, swaged, or otherwise 
formed ends, the hardness test shall be made as prescribed in 
24.1 and 24.2 on the outside of the tube near the end after the 
forming operation and heat treatment. 
24.7 For welded or brazed tubes, the hardness test shall be 
made away from the joints.

24.8 When the product specification provides for Vickers 
hardness, such testing shall be in accordance with Test Method

25. Nondestructive Examination 
25.1 Except as provided in 26.1, each tube shall be exam­
ined by a nondestructive examination method in accordance 
with Practice B213, Practice E309 (for ferromagnetic 
materials), Practice B426 (for non-magnetic materials), or 
Practice E570. Upon agreement, Practice E273 shall be em­
ployed in addition to one of the full periphery tests. The range 
of tube sizes that may be examined by each method shall be 
subject to the limitations in the scope of that practice. In case 
of conflict between these methods and practices and this 
specification, the requirements of this specification shall pre­
vail. 
25.2 The following information is for the benefit of the user 
of this specification. 
25.2.1 Calibration standards for the nondestructive electric 
test are convenient standards for calibration of nondestructive 
testing equipment only. For several reasons, including shape, 
orientation, width, and so forth, the correlation between the 
signal produced in the electric test from an imperfection and 
from calibration standards is only approximate. A purchaser 
interested in ascertaining the nature (type, size, location, and 
orientation) of discontinuities that can be detected in the 
specific application of these examinations should discuss this 
with the manufacturer of the tubular product. 
25.2.2 The ultrasonic examination referred to in this speci­
fication is intended to detect longitudinal discontinuities having 
a reflective area similar to or larger than the calibration 
reference notches specified in 25.8. Th.e examination may not 
detect circumferentially oriented imperfections or short, deep . 
defects. 
25.2.3 The eddy current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
discontinuities, especially of the short abrupt type. Practices 
B309 and E426 contain additional information regarding the 
capabilities and limitations of eddy-current examination. 
25.2.4 The flux leakage examination referred to in this 
specification is capable of detecting the presence and location 
of significant longitudinally or transversely oriented disconti­
nuities. The provisions of this specification only provide for 
longitudinal calibration for flux leakage. It should be recog­
nized that different techniques should be employed to detect 
differently oriented imperfections. 
25.2.5 The hydrostatic test referred to in Section 26 is a test 
method provided for in many product specifications. This test 
has the capability of finding defects of a size permitting the test 
fluid to leak through the tube wall and may be either visually 
seen or detected by a loss of pressure. This test may not detect 
1531

=== Page 1586 ===

SA-1016/SA-1016M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
very tight, through-the-wall defects or defects that extend an 
appreciable distance into the wall without complete penetra­
tion. 
25.2.6 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
products. 
25.3 Time of Examination-Nondestrnctive examination for 
specification acceptance shall be perfonned after all deforma­
tion processing, heat treating, welding, and straightening op­
erations. This requirement does not preclude additional testing 
at earlier stages in the processing. 
25.4 Surface Condition: 
25.4.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, paint, 
or other foreign material that could interfere with interpretation 
of test results. The methods used for cleaning and preparing the 
smfaces for examination shall not be detrimental to the base 
metal or the surface finish. 
25.4.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can 
produce signals that interfere with the test. 
25.5 Extent of Examination: 
25.5.1 The relative motion of the tube and the transducer(s), 
coil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire tube surface is 
scanned, except for end effects as noted in 25.5.2. 
25.5.2 The existence of end effects is recognized, and the 
extent of such effects shall be determined by the manufacturer, 
and, if requested, shall be reported to the purchaser. Other 
nondestrnctive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
25.6 Operator Qualifications: 
25.6.l The test unit operator shall be certified in accordance 
with SNT-TC-lA, or an equivalent documented standard 
agreeable to both purchaser and manufacturer. 
25.7 Test Conditions: 
25.7.1 For examination by the ultrasonic method, the mini­
mum nominal transducer frequency shall be 2.0 MHz, and the 
maximum transducer size shall be 1.5 in. [38 mm]. 
25.7.2 For eddy current testing, the excitation coil fre­
quency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration, yet 
provide good signal-to-noise ratio. 
25.7.2.1 The maximum coil frequency shall be: 
Specified Wall Thickness, in. [mm] Maximum Frequency, kHz 
<0.050 in. [1.25] 100 
0.050 to 0.150 (1.25 to 3.80] 50 
>0.150 [3.80] 10 
25.8 Reference Standards: 
25.8.1 Reference standards of convenient length shall be 
prepared from a length of tube of the same grade, specified size 
(outside diameter and wall thickness), surface finish, and heat 
treatment condition as the tubing to be examined. 
25.8.2 For eddy cmrent testing, the reference standard shall 
contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following discontinuities: 
25.8.2.1 Drilled Hole-The reference standard shall contain 
three or more holes, equally spaced circumferentially around 
the tube and longitudinally separated by a sufficient distance to 
allow distinct identification of the signal from each hole. The 
holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the tube 
wall, with care being taken to avoid distortion of the tube while 
drilling. The holes shall not be larger than 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] 
in diameter. As an alternative, the producer may choose to drill 
one hole and nm the calibration standard through the test coil 
three times, rotating the tube approximately 120° each time. 
More passes with smaller angular increments may be used, 
provided testing of the full 360° of the coil is obtained. For 
welded tubing, if the weld is visible, one of the multiple holes 
or the single hole shall be drilled in the weld. 
25.8.2.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool 
or file with a¼ in. [6.4 mm] diameter, a notch shall be milled 
or filed tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the tube. Said notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. 
25.8.2.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. (0.8 mm) or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
tube axis on the outside smface of the tube, to have a depth not 
exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. (0.1 mm), whichever is greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
25.8.2.4 When minimum wall tubing is specified, the notch 
depth shall be based on the calculated average wall thickness 
from Table 2 (see Note 3). 
25.8.3 For ultrasonic testing, the reference ID and OD 
notches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes 
shown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The 
depth of the notches shall not exceed 12.5 % of the specified 
average wall thickness of the tube or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], 
whichever is greater. When minimum tubing is specified, the 
notch depth shall be based on the calculated average wall 
thickness from Table 2 (see Note 3). The width of the notch 
shall not exceed two times the depth. For welded tubing, the 
notches shall be placed in the weld, if the weld is visible. When 
the notch is placed in the weld, the notch depth shall be 
measured from the surface of the weld. 
Norn 3-To calculate the average wall thickness when minimum wall 
tubing is specified, the calculated average wall shall be the specified 
minimum wall plus V2 of the Permitted Maximum Variation in Wall 
Thickness cited in Table 2. For example, when a cold finished, 1 by 0.083 
in. [25 by 2 mm] minimum wall seamless tube is specified, the calculated 
average thickness will be 0.091 in. (0.083 in.+ V2 (20 %)) [2.2 mm (2 mm 
+ ½ (20 %))]. 
25.8.4 For flux leakage testing, the longitudinal reference 
notches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a radial 
plane parallel to the tube axis on the inside and outside surfaces 
of the tube. Notch depth shall not exceed 12.5 % of the 
specified wall thickness or 0.004 in. [0.l mm], whichever is 
greater. Notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25.4 mm], and the 
width shall not exceed the depth. Outside and inside notches 
shall have sufficient separation to allow distinct identification 
of the signal from each notch. 
25.8.5 When minimum wall tubing is specified, the notch 
depth shall be based on the calculated average wall thickness 
from Table 2 (see Note 3).

25.8.6 More or smaller reference discontinuities, or both, 
may be used by agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
25.9 Standardization Procedure: 
25.9.1 The test apparatus shall be standardized at the 
beginning and end of each series of tubes of the same specified 
size (diameter and wall thickness), grade and heat treatment 
condition, and at intervals not exceeding 4 h during the 
examination of such tubing. More frequent standardizations 
may be performed at the manufacturer's option or may be 
required upon agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
25.9.2 The test apparatus shall also be standardized after 
any change in test system settings, change of operator, equip­
ment repair, or interruption due to power loss or shutdown. 
25.9.3 The reference standard shall be passed through the 
test apparatus at the same speed and test system settings as the 
tube to be tested, except that, at the manufacturer's discretion, 
the tubes may be tested at a higher sensitivity. 
25.9.4 The signal-to-noise ratio for the reference standard 
shall be 2.5 to 1 or greater, and the reference signal amplitude 
for each discontinuity shall be at least 50 % of full scale of the 
display. In establishing the noise level, extraneous signals from 
identifiable surface imperfections on the reference standard 
may be ignored. When reject filtering is used during UT 
testing, linearity must be demonstrated. 
25.9.5 If, upon any standardization, the reference signal 
amplitude has decreased by at least 29 % (3.0 dB), the test 
apparatus shall be considered out of standardization. The test 
system settings may be changed, or the transducer(s), coil(s), 
or sensor(s) adjusted, and the unit restandardized, but all tubes 
tested since the last acceptable standardization must be re­
tested. 
25.10 Evaluation of Impeifections: 
25.10.1 Tubing producing a test signal equal to or greater 
than the lowest signal produced by the reference standard shall 
be designated suspect, shall be clearly marked or identified, 
and shall be separated from the acceptable tubing. 
25.10.2 Such suspect tubing shall be subject to one of the 
following three dispositions: 
25.10.2.1 The tubes shall be rejected without further 
examination, at the discretion of the manufacturer. 
25.10.2.2 If the test signal was produced by imperfections 
such as scratches, surface roughness, dings, straightener marks, 
loose ID bead and cutting chips, steel die stamps, stop marks, 
tube reducer ripple, or chattered flash tJ.im, the tubing shall be 
accepted or rejected depending on visual observation of the 
severity of the imperfection, the type of signal it produces on 
the testing equipment used, or both. 
25.10.2.3 If the test signal was produced by imperfections 
that cannot be identified, or was produced by cracks or 
crack-like imperfections, the tubing shall be rejected. 
25.10.3 Any tubes with imperfections of the types in 
25.10.2.2 and 25.10.2.3, exceeding 0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 
12.5 % of the specified minimum wall thickness (whichever is 
greater) in depth shall be rejected. 
25.10.4 Rejected tubes may be reconditioned and retested 
providing the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that 
required by this or the product specification. If grinding is 
perfo1med, the outside diameter in the area of grinding may be 
reduced by the amount so removed. To be accepted, recondi­
tioned tubes must pass the nondestructive examination by 
which they were originally rejected. 
26. Hydrostatic Test 
26.1 In lieu of nondestructive electJ.ic examination, and 
when specified by the purchaser, and, except as provided in 
26.2 and 26.3, each tube shall be tested by the manufacturer to 
a minimum hydrostatic test pressure determined by the follow­
ing equation: 
where: 
Inch- Pound Units:P = 32000 t/D 
SI Units:P = 220.6 t/D 
P = hydrostatic test pressure, psi or MPa, 
t = specified wall thickness, in. or mm, and 
D = specified outside diameter, in. or mm. 
(3) 
26.1.1 The hydrostatic test pressure determined by Eq 3 
shall be rounded to the nearest 50 psi [0.5 MPa] for pressure 
below 1000 psi [7 MPa], and to the nearest 100 psi [1 MPa] for 
pressures 1000 psi [7 MPa] and above. The hydrostatic test 
may be performed prior to cutting to final length, or prior to 
upsetting, swaging, expanding, bending or other forming 
operations, or both. 
26.2 Regardless of the determination made by Eq 3, the 
minimum hydrostatic test pressure required to satisfy these 
requirements need not exceed 1000 psi [7 MPa]. This does not 
prohibit testing at higher pressures at manufacturer's option or 
as provided in 26.3. 
26.3 With concurrence of the manufacturer, a minimum 
hydrostatic test pressure in excess of the requirements of 26.2 
or 26.1, or both, may be stated on the order. The tube wall 
stress shall be determined by the following equation: 
S = PD/2t (4) 
where: 
S = tube wall stress, psi or MPa, and all other symbols as 
defined in 24.1. 
26.4 The test pressure shall be held for a minimum of 5 s. 
26.5 If any tube shows leaks during the hydrostatic test, it 
shall be rejected. 
26.6 The hydrostatic test may not be capable of testing the 
end portion of the pipe. The lengths of pipe that cannot be 
tested shall be determined by the manufacturer and, when 
specified in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
27. Pneumatic Test 
27.1 Air Undenvater Test-When this test is required, each 
tube, with internal surfac~ clean and dry, shall be internally 
pressurized to 150 psi [1000 kPa] minimum with clean and dry 
compressed air while being submerged in clear water. The tube 
shall be well lighted, preferably by underwater illumination. 
Any evidence of air leakage of the pneumatic couplings shall 
be corrected prior to testing. Inspection shall be made of the 
1533

=== Page 1588 ===

SA-1016/SA-1016M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
entire external surface of the tube after holding the pressure for 
not less than 5 s after the surface of the water has become calm. 
If any tube shows leakage during the air underwater test, it 
shall be rejected. Any leaking areas may be cut out and the tube 
retested. 
27.2 Air Pressure Test-When agreed to by the purchaser 
and supplier, a pneumatic pressure test in accordance with Test 
Method A1047/A1047M may be used in lieu of the air 
underwater test. 
Acceptance criteria shall be as follows: 
:51.5 [:540] 
> 1.5 :52.0 [>40 :550] 
>2.0 :52.5 [>50 :565] 
>2.5 :53.0 [>65 :575] 
>3.0 [>7.5] 
28. Certification and Test Reports 
0.003 [0.076] 
0.004 [0.162] 
0.005 [0, 127] 
0,006 [0, 152] 
By agreement 
28.1 The producer or supplier shall furnish a certificate of 
compliance stating that the material was manufactured, 
sampled, tested, and inspected in accordance with the 
specification, including year date, the supplementary 
requirements, and any other requirements designated in the 
purchase order or contract, and the results met the requirements 
of that specification, the supplementary requirements and the 
other requirements. A signature or notarization is not required 
on the certificate of compliance, but the document shall be 
dated and shall clearly identify the organization submitting the 
report. Notwithstanding the absence of a signature or 
notarization, the certifying organization is responsible for the 
contents of the document. 
28.2 In addition to the certificate of compliance, the manu­
facturer shall furnish test reports that include the following 
information and test results, where applicable: 
28.2.1 Heat number, 
28.2.2 Heat analysis, 
28.2.3 Product analysis, when specified, 
28.2.4 Tensile prope1ties, 
28.2.5 Width of the gauge length, when longitudinal strip

report or in a separate document, any other information that is 
required to be reported by the product specification or .the 
purchase order or contract. 
28.4 The certificate of compliance shall include a statement 
of explanation for the letter added to the specification number 
marked on the tubes (see 30.3) when all of the requirements of 
the specification have not been completed. The purchaser must 
certify that all requirements of the specification have been 
completed before the removal of the letter (that is, X, Y, or Z). 
28.5 A test report, certificate of compliance, or similar 
document printed from or used in electronic form from an 
electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission shall be re­
garded as having the same validity as a counterpart printed in 
the certifier's facility. The content of the EDI transmitted 
document shall meet the requirements of the invoked ASTM 
standard(s) and conform to any existing EDI agreement be­
tween the purchaser and supplier. Notwithstanding the absence 
of a signature, the organization submitting the EDI transmis­
sion is responsible for the content of the report. 
29. Inspection 
29.1 The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's inspector 
all reasonable facilities necessary to be satisfied that the 
product is being produced and furnished in accordance with the 
ordered product specification. Mill inspection by the purchaser 
shall not interfere with the manufacturer's operations. 
30. Rejection 
30.1 Each length of tubing received from the manufacturer 
may be inspected by the purchaser and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of the ordered product specification based on the 
inspection and test method as outlined in the ordered product 
specification, the length shall be rejected and the manufacturer 
shall be notified. Disposition of rejected tubing shall be a 
matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the pur­
chaser. 
30.2 Material that fails in any of the forming operations or 
in the process of installation and is found to be defective shall 
be set aside and the manufacturer shall be notified for mutual 
evaluation of the material's suitability. Disposition of such 
material shall be a matter for agreement. 
31. Product Marking 
31.1 Each length of tube shall be legibly stenciled with the 
manufacturer's name or brand, the specification number, and 
grade. The marking need not include the year of issue of the 
specification. For tubes less than 1 ¼ in. [31. 8 mm] in diameter 
and tubes under 3 ft [l m] in length, the required information 
may be marked on a tag securely attached to the bundle or box 
in which the tubes are shipped. 
31.2 For austenitic steel pipe, the marking paint or ink shall 
not contain detrimental amounts of harmful metals, or metal 
salts, such as zinc, lead, or copper, which cause c01Tosive 
attack on heating. 
31.3 When it is specified that certain requirements of a 
specification adopted by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Committee are to be completed by the purchaser upon receipt 
of the material, the manufacturer shall indicate that all require­
ments of the specification have not been completed by a letter 
such as X, Y, or Z, immediately following the specification 
number. This letter may be removed after completion of all 
requirements in accordance with the specification. An expla­
nation of specification requirements to be completed is pro­
vided in 28.4.

31.4 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 31.1 -
31.3, the manufacturer shall have the option of using bar 
coding as a supplementary identification method. Bar coding 
should be consistent with the (AIAG) standard prepared by the 
Primary Metals Subcommittee of the AIAG Bar Code Project 
Team. 
32. Packaging, Marking, and Loading 
32.1 When specified on the purchase order, packaging, 
marking, and loading for shipment shall be in accordance with 
the procedures of Practices A 700. 
33. Government Procurement 
33.1 Scale Free Tube: 
33.1.1 When specified in the contract or order, the following 
requirements shall be considered in the inquiry contract or 
order, for agencies of the U.S. Government where scale-free 
tube is required. These requirements shall take precedence if 
there is a conflict between these requirements and the product 
specification. 
33.1.2 Tube shall be ordered to outside diameter (OD) and 
wall thickness. 
33.1.3 Responsibility for Inspection-Unless otherwise 
specified in the contract or purchase order, the manufacturer is 
responsible for the performance of all inspection and test 
requirements specified. The absence of any inspection require­
ments in the specification shall not relieve the contractor of the 
responsibility for ensuring that all products or supplies submit­
ted to the government for acceptance comply with all require­
ments of the contract. Sampling inspection, as part of the 
manufacturing operations, is an acceptable practice to ascertain 
conformance to requirements; however, this does not authorize 
submission of known defective material, either indicated or 
actual, nor does it commit the government to accept the 
material. Except as otherwise specified in the contract or 
purchase order, the manufacturer may use his own or any other 
suitable facilities for the performance of the inspection and test 
requirements unless disapproved by the purchaser at the time 
the order is placed. The purchaser shall have the right to 
perform any of the inspections and tests set forth when such 
inspections and tests are deemed necessary to ensure that the 
material conforms to the prescribed requirements. 
33.1.4 Sampling for Flattening and Flaring Test and for 
Visual and Dimensional Examination-Minimum sampling for 
flattening and flaring tests and visual and dimensional exami­
nation shall be as follows: 
Lot Size (pieces per lot) Sample Size 
2 to 8 Entire lot 
9 to 90 8 
91 to 150 12 
151 to 280 19 
~1~WO ~ 
501 to 1200 27 
1201 to 3200 35 
3201 to 10 ooo 38 
10 001 to 35 ooo 46 
In all cases, the acceptance number is zero and the rejection 
number is one. Rejected lots may be screened and resubmitted 
for visual and dimensional examination. All defective items 
shall be replaced with acceptable items prior to lot acceptance. 
33.1.5 Sampling for Chemical Analysis-One sample for 
chemical analysis shall be selected from each of two tubes 
chosen from each lot. A lot shall be all material poured from 
one heat. 
33.1.6 Sampling for Tension and Bend Test-One sample 
shall be taken from each lot. A lot shall consist of all tube of the 
same outside diameter and wall thickness manufactured during 
an 8-h shift from the same heat of steel, and heat treated under 
the same conditions of temperature and time in a single charge 
in a batch type furnace, or heat treated under the same 
condition in a continuous furnace, and presented for inspection 
at the same time. 
33.1.7 Hydrostatic and Ultrasonic Tests-Each tube shall be 
tested by the ultrasonic (when specified) and hydrostatic tests. 
33.1.8 Tube shall be free from heavy oxide or scale. The 
internal surface of hot finished ferritic steel tube shall be 
pickled or blast cleaned to a free of scale condition equivalent 
to the CSa2 visual standard listed in SSPC-SP6. Cleaning shall 
be performed in accordance with a written procedure that has 
been shown to be effective. This procedure shall be available 
for audit. 
33.1.9 In addition to the marking in Specification A530/ 
A530M, each length of tube ¼ in. outside diameter and larger 
shall be marked with the following listed information. Marking 
shall be in accordance with FED-STD-183 and MIL-STD- 792: 
(a) Outside diameter, wall thickness, and length (b) Heat or lot 
identification number. 
33.1.10 Tube shall be straight to within the tolerances 
specified in Table 7.

6. General Requirements for Delivery 
6.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A568/A568M for sheets and Specification A749/ 
A749M for strip, unless otherwise provided for herein. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 The heat analysis of the steel shall conform to the 
chemical composition requirements of the appropriate desig­
nation shown in Table 1 for CS, DS and SFS, and Table 2 for 
SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS. 
7 .1.1 A report of heat analysis will be supplied, if requested, 
for CS and DS. For materials with required mechanical 
properties, SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS, a report of heat 
analysis is required. 
7.2 Each of the elements listed in Table 1, Table 2, and 
Specification A568/ A568M Table X2.3 shall be included in the 
report of the heat analysis. When the amount of copper, nickel, 
chromium, or molybdenum is less than 0.02 %, report the 
analysis as <0.02 % or the actual determined value. When the 
amount of vanadium, columbium, or titanium is less than 
0.008 %, report the analysis as <0.008 % or the actual deter­
mined value. When the amount of boron is less than 0.0005 %, 
report the analysis as <0.0005 % or the actual determined 
value. 
7.3 Sheet steel grades defined by this specification are 
suitable for welding if appropriate welding conditions are 
selected. For certain welding processes, if more restrictive 
composition limits are desirable, they shall be specified at the 
time of inquiry and confirmed at the time of ordering. 
8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 CS and DS: 
8.1.1 Typical, nonmandatory mechanical properties for CS 
and DS for all grades specified in Table 1 and Specification 
A568/A568M Table X2.3 are found in Table 3. 
8.1.2 The material represented by all grades specified in 
Table 1 and Specification A568/ A568M Table X2.3 shall be 
capable of being bent at room temperature in any direction 
through 180° flat on itself without cracking on the outside of 
the bent portion (see the section on bend test in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370). The bend test is not a requirement of 
delivery. However, if testing is performed by the purchaser, 
material not conforming to the requirement shall be subject to 
rejection. 
8.2 SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS: 
8.2.1 The available grades and corresponding mechanical 
properties for SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS are shown in 
Table 4.
