GENERAL-PURPOSE PIPING 
SA-181/SA-lSlM cO 
INTERNATIONAL 
Standards Worldwide 
(Identical with ASTM Specification A 181/A 181M-06) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers nonstandard as-forged :fit­
tings, valve components, and parts for general service. 
Forgings made to this specification are limited to a maxi­
mum weight of 10 000 lb [ 4540 kg]. Larger forgings may 
be ordered to Specification A 266/ A 266M. 
1.2 Two classes of material are covered, designated 
as Classes 60 and 70, respectively, and are classified in 
accordance with their mechanical properties as specified 
in 6.1. 
1.3 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound 
units and SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the 
material shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification.

required, test specimens shall not be removed until after 
post-weld heat treatment is complete, except for ferritic grades 
when the post-weld heat treatment is conducted at least 50 °F 
[30 °C] below the actual tempering temperature. When test 
blanks are used, they shall receive approximately the same 
working as the finished product. The test blanks shall be heat 
treated with the finished product and shall approximate the 
maximum cross section of the forgings they represent.

9.3.1 With prior purchase approval, the test specimen for 
ferritic steel forgings may be taken at a depth (t) corresponding 
to the distance from the area of significant stress to the nearest 
heat-treated surface and at least twice this distance (2 t) from 
any second surface. However, the test depth shall not be nearer 
to one treated surface than¾ in. [19 mm] and to the second 
treated surface than 1 ½ in. [38 mm]. This method of test 
specimen location would normally apply to contour-forged

A All values are maximum unless otherwise stated. Where ellipses( ... ) appear in this table, there is no requirement and analysis for the element need not be determined 
or reported. 
8 Niobium and columbium are interchangeable names for the same element and both names are acceptable for use in A01.22 specifications. 
c Grade F 2 was formerly assigned to the 1 % chromium, 0.5 % molybdenum grade which is now Grade F 12. • 
0 The present grade F 5a (0.25 max carbon) previous to 1955 was assigned the identification symbol F 5. Identification symbol F 5 in 1955 was assigned to the 0.15 max 
carbon grade to be consistent with ASTM specifications for other products such as pipe, tubing, bolting, welding fittings, and the like. 
"Applies to both heat and product analyses. 
F For Grade F 22V, rare earth metals (REM) may be added in place of calcium, subject to agreement between the producer and the purchaser. In that case the total amount 
of REM shall be determined and reported. 
0 The ratio of Titanium to Nitrogen shall be ee 3.5. Alternatively, in lieu of this ratio limit, Grade F 23 shall have a minimum hardness of 275 HV (26 HRC, 258 HBW) in 
the hardened condition (see 3.2.1). Hardness testing shall be performed in accordance with 9.6.3, and the hardness testing results shall be reported on the material test 
report (see 18.2.5). 
H Grade F XM-27Cb shall have a nickel plus copper content of 0.50 max%. Product analysis tolerance over the maximum specified limit for carbon and nitrogen shall be 
0.002 %. 
'Grade F 316Ti shall have a titanium content not less than five times the carbon plus nitrogen content and not more than 0.70 %. 
J Grade F 321 shall have a titanium content of not less than five times the carbon plus nitrogen content and not more than 0.70 %. 
KGrade F 321H shall have a titanium content of not less than four times the carbon plus nitrogen content and not more than 0.70 %. 
L Grades F 347 and F 348 shall have a niobium (columbium) content of not less than ten times the carbon content and not more than 1.1 O %. 
MGrades F 347H and F 348H shall have a niobium (columbium) content of not less than eight times the carbon content and not more than 1.10 %. 
N Grade F 347LN, Grade F 347LNCuB, and Grade F 317LNCb shall have a niobium (columbium) content of not less than 15 times the carbon content.

PChromium Nickel Balance is defined as CNB = (Cr+6Si+4Mo+1.5W+11V+5Nb+9Ti+12AI)- (40C+30N+4Ni+2Mn+1Cu). 
0 Al + Ti shall be 0.85 % min: 1.20 % max. 
R The method of analysis for nitrogen shall be a matter of agreement between purchaser and manufacturer. 
parts, or parts with thick cross-sectional areas where ¼ T x T 
testing (see 9.3) is not practical. Sketches showing the exact 
test locations shall be approved by the purchaser when this 
method is used. 
9.3.2 Metal Buffers-The required distances from heat­
treated surfaces may be obtained with metal buffers instead of 
integral extensions. Buffer material may be carbon or low-alloy 
steel, and shall be joined to the forging with a partial 
penetration weld that seals the buffered surface. Specimens 
shall be located at V2-in. [13-mm] minimum from the buffered 
surface of the forging. Buffers shall be removed and the welded 
areas subjected to magnetic particle test to ensure freedom 
from cracks unless the welded areas are completely removed 
by subsequent machining. 
9 .4 For annealed low alloy steels, ferritic stainless steels, 
and martensitic stainless steels, and also for austenitic and 
ferritic-austenitic stainless steels, the test specimen may be 
taken from any convenient location. 
9.5 Tension Tests: 
9.5.l Low Alloy Steels and Ferritic and Martensitic Stain­
less Steels-One tension test shall be made for each heat in 
each heat treatment charge. 
9.5.1.1 When the heat-treating cycles are the same and the 
furnaces (either batch or continuous type) are controlled within 
±25 °F [ ± 14 °C] and equipped with recording pyrometers so 
that complete records of heat treatment are available, then only 
one tension test from each heat of each forging type (see Note

each batch load, and at least one check per hour shall be made 
from a continuous run. When the furnace batch is less than 
eight forgings, each forging shall be checked. If any check falls 
222 
outside the prescribed limits, the entire lot of forgings shall be 
reheat treated and the requirements of 9.5.1 shall apply. 
NoTE 2-The tension test required in 9.5.1 is used to determine material 
capability and conformance in addition to verifying the adequacy of the 
heat-treatment cycle. Additional hardness tests in accordance with 9.6.2 
are required when 9.5.1.1 is applied to ensure the prescribed heat-treating 
cycle and uniformity throughout the load.

amination: 
13 .4.1 Forgings producing a signal equal to or greater than 
the lowest signal produced by the reference discontinuities 
shall be identified and separated from the acceptable forgings. 
The area producing the signal may be reexamined. 
13.4.2 Such forgings shall be rejected if the test signals were 
produced by impetfections that cannot be identified or were 
produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. Such forgings 
may be repaired. To be accepted, a repaired forging shall pass 
the same nondestructive test by which it was rejected, and it 
shall meet the minimum wall thickness requirements of this 
specification and the purchase order. 
13.4.3 If the test signals were produced by visual imperfec­
tions such as scratches, surface roughness, dings, tooling 
marks, cutting chips, steel die stamps, or stop marks, the 
forging is permitted to be accepted based upon visual exami­
nation provided that the depth of the imperfection is less than 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness, 
whichever is the greater. 
13.5 Treatment of Impe,fections Found by Magnetic Par­
ticle or Liquid Penetrant Examination: 
13.5.1 Defects shall be completely removed prior to weld 
repair by chipping or grinding to sound metal. Removal of 
these defects shall be verified by magnetic particle inspection 
in accordance with Test Method A275/A275M or by liquid 
penetrant inspection in accordance with Test Method E165/ 
E165M. 
13.5.2 Rejected forgings may be reconditioned and retested, 
provided that the wall thickness is not decreased to less than 
that required by this specification and the purchase order. The 
outside diameter at the point of grinding may be reduced by the 
amount so removed. To be accepted, retested forgings shall 
meet the test requirement.

shall have a workmanlike finish, and machined surfaces ( other 
than surfaces having special requirements) shall have a surface 
finish not to exceed 250 AA (arithmetic average) roughness 
height. 
15. Repair by Welding 
15.1 Weld repairs shall be permitted (see Supplementary 
Requirement S58 of Specification A961/A961M) at the discre­
tion of the manufacturer with the following limitations and 
requirements: 
15 .1.1 The welding procedure and welders shall be qualified 
in accordance with Section IX of the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code. 
15.1..2 The weld metal shall be deposited using the elec­
trodes specified in Table 4 except as otherwise provided in 
Supplementary Requirement S5. The electrodes shall be pur­
chased in accordance with AWS Specifications A5.4/A5.4M, 
A5.5/A5.5M, A5.9/A5.9M, A5.ll/A5.11M, A5.14/A5.14M, 
A5.23/A5.23M, A5.28/A5.28M, or A5.29/A5.29M. The sub­
merged arc process with neutral flux, the gas metal-arc process, 
the gas tungsten-arc process, and gas shielded processes using 
flux-core consumables, may be used. For weld deposits made 
on S20910, the deposited weld metal shall correspond to either 
the alloy content of the base metal or AWS A5.4 E209 or A5.9 
ER209. For weld deposits made on N08367, N08700, N08925 
or N08926, the deposited weld metal shall correspond to either 
the alloy content of the base metal or one of the following filler 
metals in AWS A5.ll ENiCrMo-3 or A5.14 ERNiCrMo-3, 
A5.ll ENiCrMo-4 or A5.14 ERNiCrMo-4, or A5.11 
ENiCrMo-10 or A5.14 ERNiCrMo-10. For weld deposits made 
on N08020, the deposited weld metal shall correspond to either 
the alloy content of the base metal or AWS A5.4 E320/E320LR 
or A5.9 ER320/320LR. For weld deposits made on N08800, 
N08810 and N08811, the deposited weld metal shall corre­
spond to either the alloy content of the base metal or A WS 
A5.ll ENiCr-3 or A5.14 ERNiCr-3. However, the fillers used 
on these alloys (as well as other listed above) may be 
dependent on the end service use and service temperature and 
shall be agreed upon between purchaser and manufacturer. 
15.1.2.1 Weld deposits made on S20910, N08020, N08367, 
N08700, N08800, N08810, N08811, N08925, N08926, and 
F35030 (UNS S35030) shall be made using filler metal with a 
composition conforming to the base material or the equivalent 
classification in the AWS Filler Metal Specification A5.11 and 
A5.14. It is possible that weld deposit chemistry will not meet 
the limits· of either the base metal or the filler metal for some 
elements. The weld deposit chemistry shall meet the lowest 
minimum and highest maximum values for each specification 
element in either of the base metal or filler metal specification. 
Dilution of the base metal and filler metal must be considered 
when determining weld deposit criteria for over-alloyed filler

inspection in accordance with Test Method E165/E165M for 
all grades. 
15 .1.4 After repair welding, the welded area shall be ground 
smooth to the original contour and shall be completely free of 
defects as verified by magnetic-particle or liquid-penetrant 
inspection, as applicable. 
15.1.5 The preheat, interpass temperature, and post-weld 
heat treatment requirements given in Table 4 shall be met. 
Austenitic stainless steel forgings may be repair-welded with­
out the post-weld heat treatment of Table 4, provided purchaser 
approval is obtained prior to repair. 
15.1.6 Repair by welding shall not exceed 10 % of the 
surface area of the forging nor 331/3 % of the wall thickness of 
the finished forging or 3/s in. [9.5 mm], whichever is less, 
without prior approval of the purchaser. 
15.1.7 When approval of the purchaser is obtained, the 
limitations set forth in 15.1.6 may be exceeded, but all other 
requirements of Section 15 shall apply. 
15.1.8 No weld repairs are permitted for F 6a Classes 3 and 
4.

seamless carbon steel boiler and superheater tubes for high­
pressure service. 
1.2 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are½ in. to 7 in. [12.7 to 177.8 mm] outside 
diameter and 0.085 to 1.000 in. [2.2 to 25.4 mm], inclusive, in 
minimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may 
be furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] inside diameter or 0.015 in.

1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order.

requires the addition of any element other than those listed in 
7.1 is not permitted. 
8. Product Analysis 
8.1 When requested on the purchase order, a product analy­
sis shall be made by the supplier from one tube per 100 pieces 
for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm] and one tube per 250 pieces for 
sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under; or when tubes are identified 
by heat, one tube per heat shaU be analyzed. The chemical 
composition thus determined shall conform to the requirements 
specified. 
8.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional billets or tubes shall be made. Both retests, for 
the elements in question, shall meet the requirements of the 
specification; otherwise all remaining material in the heat or lot 
(see Note 1) shall be rejected or, at the option of the producer, 
each billet or tube may be individually tested for acceptance. 
Billets or tubes which do not meet the requirements of the 
specification shall be rejected. 
Nom l-A lot consists of 250 tubes for sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under 
and of 100 tubes for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm), prior to cutting to length. 
9. Hardness Requirements 
9.1 The tubes shall have a hardness number not exceeding 
the following: 
Brinell Hardness Number (Tubes 
0.200 in. [5.1 mm] and over in 
wall thickness) 
137 HBW 
Rockwell Hardness Number 
(Tubes less than 0.200 in. 
[5.1 mm] in wall thickness) 
77 HRBW 
10. Mechanical Tests Required 
10.1 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of two tubes selected from each lot 
(see Note 1) or fraction thereof. 
10.2 Flaring Test-One flaring test shall be made on speci­
mens from each end of two tubes selected from each lot (see 
Note 1) or fraction thereof. These tubes shall be selected apart 
from those used for the flattening test. 
10.3 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot. The 
term lot applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same 
nominal diameter and wall thickness which are produced from 
the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a 
batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the 
same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the same 
furnace charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous 
furnace, a lot shall include all tubes of the same size and heat, 
heat treated in the same furnace at the same temperature, time 
at heat, and furnace speed. 
10.4 Hydrostatic Test-Each tube shall be subjected to the 
hydrostatic pressure test, or instead of this test, a nondestruc­
tive test may be used when specified by the purchaser. 
11. Forming Operations 
11.1 Tubes when inserted in the boiler shall stand expanding 
and beading without showing cracks or flaws. Superheater 
tubes when properly manipulated shall stand all forging, 
welding, and bending operations necessary for application 
without developing defects. 
12. Product Marking 
12.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A450/A450M, the marking shall indicate whether the tube is 
hot finished or cold finished.

SA-193/SA-193M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Alloy-Steel and Stainless Steel Bolting for High Temperature 
or High Pressure Service and Other Special Purpose 
Applications 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers alloy and stainless steel bolt­
ing materials and bolting components for pressure vessels, 
valves, flanges, and fittings for high temperature or high 
pressure service, or other special purpose applications. See 
Specification A962/A962M for the definition of bolting. Bars 
and wire shall be hot-wrought and may be further processed by 
centerless grinding or by cold drawing. Austenitic stainless 
steel may be carbide solution treated or carbide solution treated 
and strain-hardened. When strain hardened austenitic stainless 
steel is ordered, the purchaser should take special care to 
ensure that Appendix XI is thoroughly understood. 
1.2 Several grades are covered, including ferritic steels and 
austenitic stainless steels designated B5, BS, and so forth. 
Selection will depend upon design, service conditions, me­
chanical properties, and high temperature characteristics. 
1.3 The following referenced general requirements are in­
dispensable for application of this specification: Specification 
A962/A962M. 
Norn 1-The committee formulating this specification has included 
several steel types that have been rather extensively used for the present 
purpose. Other compositions will be considered for inclusion by the 
committee from time to time as the need becomes apparent. 
Norn 2-For grades of alloy-steel bolting suitable for use at the lower 
range of high temperature applications, reference should be made to 
Specification A354. 
Norn 3-For grades of alloy-steel bolting suitable for use in low 
temperature applications, reference should be made to Specification 
A320/A320M. 
1.4 Nuts for use with bolting are covered in Section 13. 
1.5 Supplementary Requirements are provided for use at the 
option of the purchaser. The supplementary requirements shall 
apply only when specified in the purchase order or contract. 
1.6 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units; however, unless the purchase order or contract 
specifies the applicable M specification designation (SI units), 
the inch-pound units shall apply. 
1.7 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

AValues are maximums unless a range or a minimum is indicated. Where ellipses appear in this table, there is no requirement and the element need not be detennined or reported. The intentional addition of Bi, Se, 
Te, and Pb is not permitted. 
sProduct Analysis-Individual detenninations sometimes vary from the specified limits as shown in the tables. The several determinations of any individual element in a heat may not vary both above and below the 
specified range. Product variation limits are over for maximums, over or under for ranges, and under for minimums, unless otherwise indicated. 
°Typical steel compositions used for this grade include 4140, 4142, 4145, 4140H, 4142H, and 4145H. 
°For bar sizes over 3½ in. (90 mm], inclusive, the carbon content may be 0.50 % max. For the B7M grade, a minimum carbon of 0.28 % is pennitted, provided that the required tensile properties are met in the section 
sizes involved, the use of AISI 4130 or 4130H is allowed.

6.1.2 Use of water quenching is prohibited for any ferritic 
grade when heat treatment is performed after heading or 
threading. 
6.1.3 Except as permitted below for B6X; bolting material 
that is subsequently cold drawn for dimensional control shall 
be stress-relieved after cold drawing. The minimum stress­
relief temperature shall be within not more than 100 °F [55 °C] 
below the tempering temperature. Tests for mechanical prop­
erties shall be performed after stress relieving. 
6.1.4 B6 and B6X shall be held at the tempering tempera­
ture for a minimum time of 1 h. B6X bolting material may be 
furnished in the as-rolled-and-tempered condition. Cold works 
ing after heat treatment is permitted for B6X material provided 
the final hardness meets the requirements of Tables 2 and· 3. 
6.1.5 B7 and B7M shall be heat treated by quenching in a 
liquid medium and tempering. For B7M bolting components, 
such as bolts, studs, or screws, the final heat treatment, which 
may be the tempering operation if conducted at 1150 °F [620 
0 C] minimum, shall be done after all machining and forming 
operations, including thread rolling and any type of cutting. 
Surface preparation for hardness testing, nondestructive 
evaluation, or ultrasonic bolt tensioning is permitted. 
6.1.5.1 Unless otherwise specified, bolting material for 
Grade B7 may be heat treated by the Furnace, the Induction or 
the Electrical Resistance method. 
Norn 4--Stress-relaxation properties may vary from heat lot to heat lot 
or these properties may vary from one heat-treating method to another. 
The purchaser may specify Supplementary Requirement S8, when stress­
relaxation testing is desired. 
6.1.6 Bolting material Grade B16 shall be heated to a 
temperature range from 1700 to 1750 °F [925 to 955 °C] and 
oil quenched. The minimum tempering temperature shall be as 
specified in Tables 2 and 3. 
6.2 Austenitic Stainless Steels: 
6.2.1 All austenitic stainless steels shall receive a carbide 
solution treatment (see 6.2.2 - 6.2.5 for specific requirements 
for each class). Classes 1, lB, IC (Grades B8R and B8S only), 
2, 2B, and 2C can apply to bar, wire, and finished bolting 
components. Class lA (all grades) and Class IC (grades B8RA 
and B8SA only) can apply to finished bolting components. 
Class ID applies only to bar and wire and finished bolting 
components that are machined directly from Class ID bar or 
wire without any subsequent hot or cold working. 
6.2.2 Classes I and JB, and Class JC Grades B8R and 
BBS-After rolling of the bar, forging, or heading, whether 
done hot or cold, bolting material shall be heated from ambient 
temperature and held a sufficient time at a temperature at which 
the chromium carbide will go into solution and then shall be 
cooled at a rate sufficient to prevent the precipitation of the 
carbide. 
6.2.3 Class JD-Rolled or forged Grades B8, B8M, B8P, 
B8LN, B8MLN, B8CLNCuB, B8N, B8MN, B8R, and B8S bar 
shall be cooled rapidly immediately following hot working 
while the temperature is above 1750 °F [955 °C] so that grain 
boundary carbides remain in solution. Class ID shall be 
restricted to applications at temperatures less than 850 °F [455 
oq, 
6.2.4 Class IA and Class IC Grades B8RA and BBSA­
Finished bolting components shall be carbide solution treated 
after all rolling, forging, heading, and threading operations are 
complete. This designation does not apply to starting material 
such as bar. Components shall be heated from ambient tem­
perature and held a sufficient time at a temperature at which the 
chromium carbide will go into solution and then shall be 
cooled at a rate sufficient to prevent the precipitation of the 
carbide. 
6.2.5 Classes 2, 2B, and 2C-Bolting material shall be 
carbide solution treated by heating from ambient temperature 
and holding a sufficient time at a temperature at which the 
chromium carbide will go into solution and then cooling at a 
rate sufficient to prevent the precipitation of the carbide. 
Following this treatment the bolting material shall then be 
strain hardened to achieve the required properties. 
Norn 5-Heat treatment follqwing operations performed on a limited 
portion of the product, such as heading, may result in non-uniform grain 
size and mechanical properties through the section affected. 
242 
6.2.6 If a scale-free bright finish is required; this shall be 
specified in the purchase order. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 Each alloy shall conform to the chemical composition 
requirements prescribed in Table 1. 
8. Heat Analysis 
8.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the 
manufacturer to determine the percentages of the elements 
specified in Section 7. The chemical composition thus deter­
mined shall be reported to the purchaser or the purchaser's 
representative, and shall conform to the requirements specified 
in Section 7. Should the purchaser deem it necessary· to have 
the transition zone of two heats sequentially cast discarded, the 
purchaser shall invoke Supplementary Requirement S3 of 
Specification A 788/ A 788M. 
9. Mechanical Properties 
9.1 Tensile Properties: 
9.1.1 Requirements-Bolting material as represented by the 
tension specimens shall conform to the requirements pre­
scribed in Tables 2 and 3 at room temperature after heat 
treatment. Stainless strain hardened bolting components (Class 
2, 2B, and 2C) shall be tested full size after strain hardening to 
determine tensile strength and yield strength and shall conform 
to the requirements prescribed in Tables 2 and 3. In cases 
where tensile testing equipment of sufficient capacity is not 
available, stainless strain hardened bolting components greater 
than 1.500 in. diameter may be tested using machined speci­
men. Should the results of full size tests conflict with results of 
tension specimen tests, full size test results shall prevail. 
9.1.2 Full Size Bolting Components, Wedge Tensile 
Testing-When applicable, see 12.1.3, headed components 
shall be wedge tested full size. The minimum full size load 
applied (lbf or kN) for individual sizes shall be as follows:

Test Methods F606/F606M. 
9.2.2 Grade B7M-The maximum hardness of the grade 
shall be 235 HBW or 99 HRB. The minimum hardness shall 
not be less than 200 HBW or 93 HRB. Conformance to this 
hardness shall be ensured by testing the hardness of each stud 
or bolt by Brinell or Rockwell B methods in accordance with 
9 .2.1. The use of 100 % electromagnetic testing for hardness as 
an alternative to 100 % indentation hardness testing is permis­
sible when qualified by sampling using indentation hardness 
testing. Each lot tested for hardness electromagnetically shall 
be 100 % examined in accordance with Practice E566. Follow­
ing electromagnetic testing for hardness, a random sample of a 
minimum of 100 pieces of each heat of steel in each lot (as 
defined in 12.1.1) shall be tested by indentation hardness 
methods. All samples must meet hardness requirements to 
permit acceptance of the lot. If any one sample is outside of the 
specified maximum or minimum hardness, the lot shall be 
rejected and either reprocessed and resampled or tested 100 % 
by indentation hardness methods. 
9.2.2.l Surface preparation for indentation hardness testing 
shall be in accordance with Test Methods E18. Hardness tests 
shall be performed on the end of the bolt or stud. When this is 
impractical, the hardness test shall be performed elsewhere.

fication in preference to this specification. 
S3. 100 % Hardness Testing of Grade B7M 
S3.1 Each Grade B7M bolt or stud shall be tested for 
hardness by indentation method and shall meet the require­
ments specified in Tables 2 and 3. 
S4. Hardness Testing of Grade B16 
S4.1 For bolts or studs 2½ in. [65 mm] or smaller, the 
hardness for Grade B 16 shall be measured on or near the end 
of each bolt or stud using one of the methods prescribed in 
9.2.1 for the Brinell or Rockwell C test. The hardness shall be 
in the range 253-319 HBW or 25-34 HRC. 
SS. Product Marking 
S5.1 Grade and manufacturer's identification symbols shall 
be applied to one end of studs and to the heads of bolts and 
screws of all sizes. (If the available area is inadequate, the 
grade symbol may be marked on one end and the manufactur­
er's identification symbol marked on the other end.) For bolts 
and screws smaller than¼ in. [6 mm] in diameter and studs 
smaller than 3/s in. [10 mm] in diameter and for ¼ in. [6 mm] 
in diameter studs requiring more than a total of three symbols, 
the marking shall be a matter of agreement between the 
purchaser and the manufacturer.

APPENDIXES 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. STRAIN HARDENING OF AUSTENITIC STEELS 
Xl.1 Strain hardening is the increase in strength and hard­
ness that results from plastic deformation below the recrystal-. 
lization temperature (cold work). This effect is produced in 
austenitic stainless steels by reducing oversized bars or wire to 
the desired final size by cold drawing or other process. The 
degree of strain hardening achievable in any alloy is limited by 
its strain hardening characteristics. In addition, the amount of 
strain hardening that can be produced is further limited by the 
variables of the process, such as the total amount of cross­
section reduction, die angle, and bar size. In large diameter 
bars, for example, plastic deformation will occur principally in 
the outer regions of the bar so that the increased strength and 
hardness due to strain hardening is achieved predominantly 
near the surface of the bar. That is, the smaller the bar, the 
greater the penetration of strain hardening. 
Xl .2 Thus, the mechanical properties of a given strain 
hardened bolting component are dependent not just on the 
alloy, but also on the size of bar from which it is machined. The 
minimum bar size that can be used, however, is established by 
the configuration of the component so that the configuration 
can affect the strength of the componoent. 
Xl.3 For example, a stud of a particular alloy and size may 
be machined from a smaller diameter bar than a bolt of the 
same alloy and size because a larger diameter bar is required to 
accommodate the head of the bolt. The stud, therefore, is likely 
to be stronger than the same size bolt in a given alloy. 
X2. COATINGS AND APPLICATION LIMITS 
X2.1 Use of coated bolting components at temperatures 
above approximately one-half the melting point (Fahrenheit or 
Celsius) of the coating is not recommended unless consider­
ation is given to the potential for liquid and solid metal 
embrittlement, or both. The melting point of elemental zinc is 
approximately 780 °F [415 °C]. Therefore, application of 
246 
zinc-coated bolting components should be limited to tempera­
tures less than 390 °F [210 °C]. The melting point of cadmium 
is approximately 600 °F [320 °C]. Therefore, application of 
cadmium-coated bolting components should be limited to 
temperatures less than 300 °F [160 °C].

Specification for 
Carbon Steel, Alloy Steel, and Stainless Steel Nuts for Bolts 
for High Pressure or High Temperature Service, or Both 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers a variety of carbon, alloy, and 
martensitic stainless steel nuts in the size range ¼ through 4 in. 
and metric M12 through MlO0 nominal. It also covers auste­
nitic stainless steel nuts in the size range ¼ in. and Ml2 
nominal and above. These nuts are intended for high-pressure 
or high-temperature service, or both. Grade substitutions with­
out the purchaser's permission are not allowed. 
1.2 Bars from which the nuts are made shall be hot-wrought. 
The material may be further processed by centerless grinding 
or by cold drawing. Austenitic stainless steel may be solution 
annealed or annealed and strain-hardened. When annealed and 
strain hardened austenitic stainless steel is ordered in accor­
dance with Supplementary Requirement S 1, the purchaser 
should take special care to ensure that 8.2.2, Supplementary 
Requirement Sl, and Appendix Xl are thoroughly understood. 
1.3 Supplementary requirements of an optional nature are 
provided. These shall apply only when specified in the inquiry, 
contract, and order. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. Within the text, the SI units are shown in 
brackets. 
248 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

APPENDIXES 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. STRAIN HARDENING OF AUSTENITIC STEELS 
Xl.1 Strain hardening is the increase in strength and hard­
ness that results from plastic deformation below the recrystal­
lization temperature (cold work). This effect is produced in 
austenitic stainless steels by reducing oversized bars to the 
desired final size by cold drawing or other process. The degree 
of strain hardening achievable in any alloy is limited by its 
strain hardening characteristics. In addition, the amount of 
strain hardening that can be produced is further limited by the 
variables of the process, such as the total amount of cross-
section reduction, die angle and bar size. In large diameter bars, 
for example, plastic deformation will occur principally in the 
outer regions of the bar, so that the increased strength and 
hardness due to strain hardening is achieved predominantly 
near the surface of the bar. That is, the smaller the bar, the 
greater the penetration of strain hardening. Thus, the mechani­
cal properties of a given strain hardened bolting component are 
dependent not just on the alloy, but also on the size of bar from 
which it is machined. 
X2. COATINGS AND APPLICATION LIMITS 
X2.l Use of coated bolting components at temperatures 
above approximately one-half the melting point (Fahrenheit or 
Celsius) of the coating is not recommended unless consider­
ation is given to the potential for liquid and solid metal 
embrittlement, or both. The melting point of elemental zinc is 
approximately 780 °F [415 °C]. Therefore, application of zinc 
coated bolting components should be limited to temperatures 
less than 390 °F [210 °C]. The melting point of cadmium is 
approximately 600 °F [320 °C]. Therefore, application of 
cadmium coated bolting components should be limited to 
temperatures less than 300 °F [160 °C].
