SPECIFICATION FOR DUCTILE IRON CASTINGS FOR 
PAPER MILL DRYER ROLLS 
SA-476/SA-476M 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 476/ A 476M-00(2018) except for editorial changes in 4.1.6 and 13.1 to make certification mandatory.] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers ductile iron castings for 
use in pressure containing paper mill dryer rolls at tempera­
tures up to 450°F [230°C]. 
1.2 No precise quantitative relationship can be stated 
between the properties of the iron in various locations of 
the same casting or between the properties of a casting 
and those of a test specimen cast from the same iron (see 
Appendix Xl). 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification.

7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 The iron represented by test coupons shall conform 
to tensile requirements prescribed in Table 1. 
7.2 The yield strength prescribed in Table 1 may be 
determined by any of the approved procedures described 
in 7.3 of Test Methods E 8. 
7.3 The Brinell hardness of the material shall be a 
minimum of 201 HB. Hardness tests shall be conducted 
in accordance with Test Method E 10, using a 3000 kgf 
load. The test may be made on either the casting or on a 
test coupon representing the casting. 
8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
8.1 The castings shall conform to the dimensions on 
the drawings furnished by the purchaser, or if no drawing 
has been provided, to the dimensions predicated by the 
pattern supplied by the purchaser. Surfaces of the castings 
shall be free of adhering sand. Runners, risers, fins, and 
other extraneous metal shall be removed. 
9. Sampling 
9.1 Test coupons shall be poured from the same iron 
as the castings represented. 
9.2 Test coupons shall be cast either to the "Y" block 
size and shape shown in Fig. 1 or to the dimensions of the 
1 in. [25-mm] keel block shown in Fig. 2. The type of test 
coupon and, when selected, the size of the "Y" block shall 
be specified by the purchaser. 
9.3 The test coupons shall be cast in open molds made 
of suitable core sand with a minimum 1½ in. [38 mm] of 
sand for the 1 in. [25 mm] size and 3 in. [75 mm] of sand 
for the 3 in. [75 mm] size. The coupons shall be left in 
the mold until black. 
9.4 Table 2 shows the equivalent geometrical shapes 
with various dimensions and the equivalent "Y" block, 
based on cooling rates, and may be used as a guide for 
selection of the proper "Y" block to be specified to repre­
sent the casting. 
9.5 When the castings are heat treated, the test coupons 
shall be heat treated with the castings they represent. 
10. Tension Test 
10.1 Tension test specimens shall be obtained from test 
coupons shown in either Fig. 1 or Fig. 2, and machined 
to the dimensions shown in Fig. 3. Test coupons cast as 
"Y" blocks (Fig. 1) shall be sectioned as shown in Fig. 4. 
10.2 One tension test shall be performed for each 
casting. 
10.3 If any specimen shows defective machining or 
flaws, it may be discarded and another substituted from 
the same casting represented. 
10.4 If an apparently sound test specimen fails to con­
form to the tensile requirements, two retests may be made. 
If either retest fails to conform to the requirements speci­
fied, the castings shall be rejected. 
11. Repairs 
11.1 Castings made to this specification that leak on 
subsequent hydrostatic testing may be repaired by using 
threaded plugs provided the following requirements are 
met. 
11.1.1 No welding or brazing shall be permitted. 
11.1.2 The diameter of the plug shall not exceed 
the diameter of a standard 2 in. [ISO R2] iron pipe size 
pipe plug. 
11.1.3 The plugs, where practical, shall conform in 
all dimensions to the standard iron pipe size pipe plugs. 
In addition, they shall have full thread engagement corres­
ponding to the thickness of the repaired section. Where a 
tapered plug is impractical because of the excess wall 
thickness in terms of plug diameter and coincident thread 
engagement, other types of plugs may be used provided 
both full thread engagement and effective sealing against 
pressure are obtained. Where possible the ends of the plugs 
should be ground smooth after installation to conform to 
the inside and outside contours of the cylinder. 
11.1.4 The material from which the plug is manufac­
tured shall conform in all respects to this specification. 
769 
11.1.5 The area adjacent to the drilled hole should 
be examined radiographically in accordance with Guide 
E 94. The area examined shall meet the requirements of 
Severity Level 3 of Reference Radiographs E 446. 
11.1.6 The thickness of any repaired section in rela­
tion to the size of plug used shall be not less than that 
given in Table 3. 
11.1.7 The minimum radius of curvature of the 
repaired section of the cylinder in relation to the size of 
plug used shall be not less than that given in Table 4. 
11.1.8 A repaired area may consist of a maximum 
of three plugs with a spacing such that the distance between 
adjacent plugs shall not be less than those listed in Table 
5. Adjacent areas of repair, in which each contains more 
than one plug, shall be separated by at least twice the 
distance required in Table 5 for the two nearest plugs 
separating the two areas. 
11.2 Surface imperfections not exceeding 20% of the 
thickness of the section and other minor defects may be 
repaired by plugging provided the diameter of the plug 
does not exceed its length.

APPENDIX 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF 
CASTINGS 
Xl.1 The mechanical properties of iron castings are 
influenced by the cooling rate during and after solidifica­
tion, by chemical composition, by heat treatment, by the 
design of the casting, by the design and nature of the mold, 
by the location and effectiveness of gates and risers, and 
by certain other factors. 
Xl.2 The cooling rate in the mold and, therefore, the 
properties developed in any particular section are influ­
enced by the presence of cores, chills and chaplets, changes 
in section thickness, and the existence of bosses, projec­
tions, and intersections, such as junctions of ribs and 
bosses. Because of the complexity of the interactions of 
these factors, no precise quantitative relationship can be 
stated between the properties of the iron in various loca­
tions of the same casting or between the properties of a 
casting and those of a test specimen cast from the same 
iron. When such a relationship is important and must be 
known for a specific application, it may be more closely 
ascertained by appropriate experimentation. 
Xl.3 When reliable information is unavailable on the 
relationship between properties in a casting and those in 
a separately cast test specimen, and where experimentation 
would be unfeasible, the size of the test casting should be 
so selected as to approximate the thickness of the main or 
controlling section of the casting.

Specification for 
Stainless Steel Bars and Shapes for Use in Boilers and 
Other Pressure Vessels 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers hot- and cold-finished bars of 
stainless steel, including rounds, squares, and hexagons, and 
hot-rolled or extruded shapes such as angles, tees, and channels 
for use in boiler and pressure vessel construction. 2 
Nom 1-There are standards covering high nickel, chromium, auste­
nitic corrosion, and heat-resisting alloy materials. These standards are 
under the jurisdiction of ASTM Subcommittee B02.07 and may be found 
in Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol 02.04. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in

system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.3 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch­
pound units. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the

-~

=== Page 879 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-479/SA-479M 
A484M shall apply. Failure to comply with the general 
requirements of Specification A484/A484M constitutes non­
conformance with this specification. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Chemical composition shall be reported to the 
purchaser, or his representative, and shall conform to the 
requirements specified in Table 1. 
5 .2 When a product analysis is performed or requested by 
the purchaser, the tolerance limits as described in Specification 
A484/A484M apply unless Supplementary Requirement S3 is 
invoked. 
5.3 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with Test 
Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751. 
6. Grain Size for Austenitic Grades 
6.1 All austenitic grades shall be tested for average grain 
size by Test Methods Ell2. 
6.2 The H grades shall conform to an average grain size as 
follows: 
6.2.1 ASTM No. 6 or coarser for Types 304H, 309H, 310H, 
and 316H, and 
6.2.2 ASTM No. 7 or coarser for Types 321H, 347H, and 
348H. 
6.3 For S32615, the grain size as determined in accordance 
with Test Methods Ell2, comparison method, Plate 11, shall be 
No. 3 or finer. 
6.4 For N08810 and N08811, the average grain size as 
determined in accordance with Test Methods Ell2 shall be 
No. 5 or coarser. 
6.5 Supplementary Requirement Sl shall be invoked when 
non-H grade austenitic stainless steels are ordered for ASME 
Code applications for service above 1000 °F [540 °C]. 
7. Mechanical Properties Requirements 
7 .1 The material shall conform to the mechanical property 
requirements specified in Table 2 for the grade ordered. At least 
one room-temperature test shall be performed by the manufac­
turer on a sample from at least one bar or shape from each lot 
of material. 
7 .2 The yield strength shall be determined by the offset 
(0.2 % ) method as prescribed in Test Methods and Definitions 
A370. 
7 .3 Martensitic material supplied in the annealed condition 
shall be capable of meeting the hardened and tempered 
mechanical properties when heat treated. 
7.4 Hardness measurements, when required, shall be made 
at a location midway between the surface and the center of the 
cross section. 
7 .5 Martensitic grades shall be capable of meeting the 
hardness requirements after heat treating as specified in Table 
3. 
8. Testing for Intermetallic Compounds 
8.1 When specified by the purchaser in the purchase order, 
the manufacturer shall test the austenitic or austenitic-ferritic 
(duplex) stainless steel material in its final condition in 
accordance with supplementary test requirements S6. 
NoTB 2-Many, if not all, duplex stainless steels and some austenitic 
stainless steels will form intermetallic phases or compounds such as 
sigma, chi, and laves phases when exposed to temperatures below the 
specified annealing temperature or cooled slowly from a higher tempera­
ture during casting, welding, or annealing. These phases can have a 
negative effect on mechanical properties and co1Tosion resistance. These 
phases can typically be removed by correct annealing and cooling 
practices. The presence of these phases can be demonstrated by tests, 
typically involving metallography, impact toughness, or corrosion 
resistance, although the testing requirements may be different for different 
alloy grades. Such testing may or may not be routinely performed by the 
manufacturer. 
9. Certification 
9.1 The material manufacturer's certificate of compliance 
certifying that the material was manufactured and tested in 
accordance with this specification, together with a report of the 
results required by this specification and the purchase order, 
shall be furnished at the time of shipment. The certification 
shall be positively relatable to the lot of material represented. 
10. Product Marking 
10.1 In addition· to the marking requirements of Specifica­
tion A484/A484M, materials that have been heat treated or 
have been strain hardened shall be identified by placement of

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following may be made requirements when the purchaser specifies them to be applicable. 
St. Materials for High-temperature Service 
Sl.1 Unless an H grade has been ordered, this supplemen­
tary requirement shall be specified for ASME Code applica­
tions for service above 1000 °F [540 °C]. 
Sl.2 The user is permitted to use an austenitic stainless steel 
as the corresponding H grade when the material meets all 
requirements of the H grade including chemistry, annealing 
temperature, and grain size (see Section 6). 
Sl.3 The user is permitted to use an L grade austenitic 
stainless steel for service above 1000 °F [540 °C], subject to 
the applicable allowable stress table of the ASME Code, when 
the material meets all requirements of this specification and the 
grain size is ASTM No. 7 or coarser as determined in 
accordance with Test Methods El12. The grain size shall be 
reported on a Certified Test Report. 
S2. Corrosion Tests 
S2.1 Intergranular corrosion tests shall be performed by the 
manufacturer on sensitized specimens of Types 304L, 316L, 
321, 347, and 348, and for the other austenitic grades, on 
specimens representative of the as-shipped condition. All 
austenitic stainless steels shall be capable of passing inter­
granular corrosion tests in the as-shipped condition. Tests shall 
be performed in accordance with Practice E of Practices A262. 
S3. Product Analysis 
S3.1 An analysis shall be made by the manufacturer on a 
sample from one bar in each lot as defined in Specification 
A484/A484M. The analysis shall meet the requirements of 
Table 1. In the event of failure, the lot represented shall be 
rejected except that, at the option of the manufacturer, each bar 
in the lot may be tested for acceptance. Product analysis 
tolerance provisions do not apply. 
S4. Material for High Cycle Fatigue Service 
S4.1 The mechanical properties of bars furnished in lengths 
under 20 ft [6 m] shall be determined by testing one end of 
each bar. Bars furnished in lengths of 20 ft [6 m] and over shall 
be tested at each end. 
S5. Material for Optimum Resistance to Stress Corrosion 
Cracking 
S5.1 This supplementary requirement is to be referenced 
when austenitic stainless steels are to be purchased with 
solution-annealing as the final operation and with no subse­
quent cold drawing permitted. Straightening is permitted as a 
final operation to meet the straightness requirements of Speci­
fication A484/A484M unless specifically prohibited by the 
purchaser. 
S6. Demonstration of the Abse.nce of Detrimental Interme­
tallic Phase in Austenitic and Austenitic-Ferritic (Du­
plex) Grades 
S6.1 This supplementary requirement is to be referenced 
when the austenitic or duplex stainless steels are to be 
purchased with testing to demonstrate the absence of detrimen­
tal intermetallic phases that can have negative effects on 
mechanical properties or corrosion resistance of the material. 
The test method(s), reporting requirements, and acceptance 
criteria shall be agreed upon by the manufacturer and purchaser 
in the purchase agreement. 
APPENDIX 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. RATIONALE REGARDING DE]flNITION OF SOLUTION ANNEALING 
Xl. 1 It is generally recognized that austenitic stainless 
steels are solution annealed by heating to a temperature that 
dissolves (takes into solution) chromium carbides and quench­
ing rapidly so that the chromium carbides will not precipitate 
in the . grain boundaries, which could cause susceptibility to 
intergranular corrosion in a critically corrosive environment. 
Thus, solution annealing also can be accomplished for non­
stabilized grades by taking advantage of hot rolling tempera­
tures (which always exceed solution annealing temperature 
requirements), maintaining hot rolling finishing temperatures 
well above minimum solution annealing requirements, and 
immediately quenching integral with hot rolling. Stabilized 
grades (with columbium or titanium added) cannot be handled 
782 
this way, since they would become destabilized due to colum­
bium or titanium carbide solution, without subsequent reheat­
ing. 
Xl.2 For Boiler Code applications involving temperatures 
at which optimum resistance to creep is desired, the larger 
grain size of material solution annealed by reheating is 
generally desired. For that reason, a minimum grain size has 
been required of the H grades ( created for optimum elevated 
temperature properties), and a mandatory grain size test and 
report has been added for the non- H grades so that the 
information is available for those desiring to reclassify a non-H 
grade to H grade.

X1.3 To satisfy the concerns of inadvertent assignment of
fine grained material to elevated temperature applications,

special marking has been added for material that meets the
requirements of Supplementary Requirement S1.

INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
General Requirements for Flat-Rolled Stainless and Heat­
Resisting Steel Plate, Sheet, and Strip 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A480/A480M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers a group of general require­
ments that, unless otherwise specified in the purchase order or 
in an individual specification, shall apply to rolled steel plate, 
sheet, and strip, under each of the following specifications 
issued by ASTM: Specifications A240/A240M, A263, A264, 
A265, A666, A693, A793, and A895. 
1.2 In the case of conflict between a requirement of a 
product specification and a requirement of this specification, 
the product specification shall prevail. In the case of conflict 
between a requirement of the product specification or a 
requirement of this specification and a more stringent require­
ment of the purchase order, the purchase order shall prevail. 
The purchase order requirements shall not take precedence if 
they, in any way, violate the requirements of the product 
specification or this specification; for example, by waiving a 
test requirement or by making a test requirement less stringent. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The SI units are 
shown in brackets, except that when A480M is specified, 
Annex A3 shall apply for the dimensional tolerances and not 
the bracketed SI values in Annex A2. The values stated in each 
system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other, and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined. 
1.4 This specification and the applicable material specifica­
tions are expressed in both inch-pound and SI units. However, 
unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specification 
designation [SI units], the material shall be furnished in 
inch-pound units.

material specification, 
4.1.10 Specification designation and date of issue, 
4.1.11 Additions to specification or special requirements, 
4.1.12 Restrictions (if desired) on methods for determining 
yield strength (see appropriate footnote to mechanical proper­
ties table of the basic material specification), 
4.1.13 Marking requirements (see Section 25), 
4.1.14 Preparation for delivery (see Section 25), and 
4.1.15 Magnetic permeability test (when required). Refer to 
Section 19. 
5. Process 
5.1 The steel shall be manufactured/produced by the follow­
ing or as specified in the applicable material specification. 
5.1.1 The steel shall be made by electric-arc, electric­
induction, or other suitable processes. 
5.1.2 If a specific type of meltip.g is required by the 
purchaser, it shall be so specified on the purchase order. 
6. Heat Analysis 
6.1 Methods and practices· relating to chemical analysis 
shall be in accordance with Test . Methods, Practices, and 
Terminology A751. 
6.2 An analysis of each heat shall be made by the steel 
producer to determine the percentages of the elements specified 
in the applicable material specification. This analysis shall be 
made from a test sample taken during the pouring of the melt, 
or from the in-process product later in the manufacturing flow. 
6.2.1 The heat analysis shall conform to the chemical 
requirements for each of the specified elements for the grade 
ordered, as listed in the applicable product specification. 
6.2.2 All commercial metals contain small amounts of 
elements other than those which are specified. It is neither 
practical nor necessary to specify limits for unspecified ele­
ments that can be present. The producer is permitted to analyze 
for unspecified elements and is permitted to report such 
analyses. The presence of an unspecified element and the 
reporting of an analysis for that element shall not be a basis for 
rejection, unless the presence of that element causes the loss of 
a property typically expected for that metal, for the type and 
quality ordered. 
6.2.3 The purchaser is permitted to require in the purchase 
order a maximum limit for an individual element not specified 
in the product specification. Such a requirement for an element 
787

=== Page 890 ===

SA-480/SA-480M (ASTM A480/A480M} ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 
not listed in the product specification, when acknowledged in 
the order acceptance, shall be treated as a specified element, 
with determination of chemical analysis and reporting of that 
analysis. 
6.2.4 The purchaser is permitted to make the requirements 
for any element more stringent; that is, require higher mini­
mums for elements having minimum requirements or ranges 
with minimum requirements, or requiring lower maximums for 
elements having specified maximums, or ranges with maxi­
mums. The purchaser is not permitted to make chemical 
requirements less stringent. 
6.2.5 Analysis limits shall be established for specific 
elements rather than groups of elements, including but not 
limited to all others, rare earths, and balance, unless all 
elements in such a group are similar in technical effect and are 
associated in typical methods of chemical analysis. 
6.3 Except as permitted in 6.3.1, the steel shall not contain 
an unspecified element for the ordered grade to the extent that 
the steel conforms to the requirements of another grade for 
which that element is a specified element having a required 
minimum content. For this requirement, a grade is defined as 
an alloy described individually and identified by its own UNS 
designation in a table of chemical requirements within this 
specification or any specification listed within the scope as 
being covered by the specification. 
6.3.1 Unless otherwise specified to lower maximum limits 
on the purchase order, maximum allowances for unspecified 
elements will be established for Cu, Mo, Ti, and Nb for the 
specified grade if the amount of that element present in the 
material conforms with composition limits for that element in 
another grade. These allowances are Cu, 0.75 %; Mo, 0.75 %; 
Ti, 0.10 %; and Nb, 0.10 %. 
6.3.2 If any allowance in 6.3.1 is used to demonstrate 
non-substitution, then the element involved shall be reported as 
if it were a specified element. 
6.4 The producer is not permitted to certify that material is 
in compliance with an ASTM product specification when the 
purchase order has required that the material contain as a 
minimum or range an element that is neither a specified 
element nor an intentionally added unspecified element for the 
ordered grade in accordance with the definitions of Test 
Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751. 
6.5 The names columbium (Cb) and niobium (Nb) both 
refer to element 41. The name Niobium is preferred, but either 
is acceptable for reporting composition. 
7. Product Analysis 
7.1 The purchaser is permitted to perform a product analysis 
(formerly check analysis) to verify the identity of the finished 
material representing each heat or lot. Such analysis shall be 
made by any of the commonly accepted methods that will 
positively identify the material. 
7.2 The chemical composition determined in accordance 
with 7 .1 shall conform to the limits of the material specification 
within the tolerances of Table Al .1, unless otherwise specified 
in the applicable material specification or the purchase order. 
The allowable variation of a particular element in a single 
sample for product analysis is permitted to be either above or 
below the specified range. However, percentages must exhibit 
the same tendencies in all samples; that is, the several 
determinations of any individual element in a heat shall not 
vary both above and below the specified range. 
8. Material Test Report and Certification 
8 .1 A report of the results of all tests required by the product 
specification shall be supplied to the purchaser. This material 
test report shall reference the product specification designation 
and year date indicating that the material was manufactured, 
sampled, tested, and inspected in accordance with requirements 
of the product specification and has been found to meet those 
requirements. The material test report shall report the melting 
process when the purchase order requires either a specific type 
of melting or requires that the melting process used is to be 
reported. 
8.1.1 The report shall indicate the type of steel. If certifying 
that the material conforms to the requirements for more than 
one type of steel, the manufacturer may indicate each type of 
steel on the report, or may issue a separate report for each type 
of steel. 
8.2 A signature is not required on the report. However, the 
document shall clearly identify the organization submitting the 
report. Not withstanding the absence of a signature, the 
organization submitting the document is responsible for its 
content. 
8.3 A material test report, certificate of inspection, or similar 
document printed from or used in electronic form from an 
electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission shall be re­
garded as having the same validity as a counterpart printed in 
the certifiers' facility. The content of the EDI transmitted 
document must meet the requirements of the invoked ASTM 
standard(s) and conform to any existing EDI agreement be­
tween the purchaser and the supplier. Notwithstanding the 
absence of a signature, the organization submitting the EDI 
transmission is responsible for the content of the report. 
788 
8.4 When finished material is supplied to a purchase order 
specifying the product specification, the organization supply­
ing that material shall provide the purchaser with a copy of the 
original manufacturer's test report. 
Norn 1-Notwithstanding the absence of a signature, the organization 
submitting the report is responsible for the content of the report. 
Norn 2-The industry definition of EDI invoked herein is the 
computer-to-computer exchange of business information in a standard 
format such as ANSI ASC X12. 
8.4.1 When the original manufacturer's test report was 
provided by EDI to the organization supplying the finished 
material to the purchaser, the organization supplying the 
finished material shall provide to the purchaser a printed form 
of the original test report or shall retransmit the test report by 
EDI to the purchaser. In either case, the test report shall be 
complete with the full identification of the original manufac­
turer and with all data provided on the test report of the original 
manufacturer.

9. Permitted Variations in Dimensions and Weight 
9.1 Sheet, strip, and plate shall conform to the permitted 
variations in thickness, width, length and flatness, and other 
properties when specified, as listed in Annex A2 and Annex A3 
for A480 and A480M respectively, for the ordered product 
form, or as agreed upon by seller and user and specified in the 
purchase order. 
10. Workmanship 
10.1 The material shall be of uniform quality consistent 
with good manufacturing and inspection practices. The steel 
shall have no imperfections of a nature or degree, for the type 
and quality ordered, that will adversely affect the stamping, 
forming, machining, or fabrication of finished parts. 
10.2 Sheet, Strip, and Plate-For sheet and strip, restricted 
only to material ordered to have a No. 1 finish in accordance 
with 11.1.1 and 12.1.1 respectively, and for plate restricted to 
material ordered to hot-rolled and annealed or hot-rolled, 
annealed, and pickle finish in accordance with 13 .1.1 and 
13.1.2 respectively, it is permitted to grind to remove surface 
imperfections, provided such grinding does not reduce the 
thickness or width at any point beyond the permissible varia­
tions in dimensions. An iron free abrasive wheel shall be used 
for such grinding and shall be operated at a speed ample to 
ensure that defective areas are cleanly cut out. 
11. Finish for Sheet 
11.1 The types of finish available on sheet products are: 
11.1.1 No. 1 Finish-Hot-rolled, annealed, and descaled. 
11.1.2 No. 2D Finish-Cold-rolled, dull finish. 
11.1.3 No. 2B Finish-Cold-rolled, bright finish. 
11.1.3 .1 . Bright Annealed Finish-A bright cold-rolled finish 
retained by final annealing in a controlled atmosphere furnace. 
11.1.4 No. 3 Finish-Intermediate polished finish, one or 
both sides. 
11. 1.5 No. 4 Finish-General purpose polished finish, one 
or both sides. 
11.1.6 No. 6 Finish-Dull satin finish, Tampico brushed, 
one or both sides. 
11.1.7 No. 7 Finish-High luster finish. 
11.1.8 No. 8 Finish-Mirror finish. 
11.1.9 TR Finish-Cold-worked to obtain specified proper­
ties. 
Norn 3-Explanation of Sheet Finishes: 
No. I-Commonly referred to as hot-rolled annealed and pickled or 
descaled. This is a dull, nonreflective finish. 
No. 2D-A smooth, nonreflective cold-rolled annealed and pickled or 
descaled finish. This nondirectional finish is favorable for retention of 
lubricants in deep drawing applications. 
No. 2B-A smooth, moderately reflective cold-rolled annealed and 
pickled or descaled finish typically produced by imparting a final light 
cold-rolled pass using polished rolls. This general-purpose finish is more 
readily polished than No. 1 or 2D finishes. Product with 2B finish is 
normally supplied in the annealed plus lightly cold-rolled condition unless 
a tensile-rolled product is specified. 
Bright Annealed Finish-A smooth, bright, reflective finish typically 
produced by cold rolling followed by annealing in a protective atmosphere 
so as to prevent oxidation and scaling during annealing. 
No. 3-A linearly textured finish that may be produced by either 
mechanical polishing or rolling. Average surface roughness (R,,) may 
generally be up to 40 µin. A skilled operator can generally blend this 
finish. Surface roughness measurements differ with different instruments, 
laboratories, and operators. There may also be overlap in measurements of 
surface roughness for both Nos. 3 and 4 finishes. 
No. 4-A linearly textured finish that may be produced by either 
mechanical polishing or rolling. Average surface roughness (R.) may 
generally be up to 25 µin. A skilled operator can generally blend this 
finish. Surface roughness measurements differ with different instruments, 
laboratories, and operators. There may also be overlap in measurements of 
surface roughness for both Nos. 3 and 4 finishes. 
No. 6-This finish has a soft, satin appearance typically produced by 
tampico brushing a No. 4 finish. 
No. 7-Has a high degree of reflectivity. It is produced by buffing a 
finely ground surface, but the grit lines are not removed. It is chiefly used 
for architectural or ornamental purposes. 
No. 8-This is a highly reflective, smooth finish typically produced by 
polishing with successively finer grit abrasives, then buffing. Typically, 
very faint buff of polish lines may still be visible on the final product. 
Blending after part assembly may be done with buffing. 
TR Finish-The finish resulting from the cold-rolling of an annealed 
and descaled or bright annealed product to obtain mechanical properties 
higher than that of the annealed condition. Appearance will vary depend­
ing upon the starting finish, amount of cold work, and the alloy. 
Architectural Finishes-Sometimes described as a No. 5 finish, these 
are a separate category and may be negotiated between buyer and seller, 
as there are many techniques and finish variations available throughout the 
world. 
11.1.10 Architectural finish, No. 5, or other proprietary 
names are special finishes. 
11.1.11 Note 3 is not meant to be restrictive or to be used as 
a basis for rejection but is intended to give general guidelines. 
Various production methods may be used to obtain these 
finishes. 
11.1.12 Sheets can be produced with one or two sides 
polished. When polished on one side only, it is permitted to 
rough grind the other side in order to obtain the necessary 
flatness. 
12. Finish for Strip 
12.1 The various types of finish procurable on cold-rolled 
strip products are: 
12.1.1 No. 1 Finish-Cold-rolled to specified thickness, 
annealed, and descaled. 
12.1.2 No. 2 Finish-Same as No. 1 finish, followed by a 
final light cold-roll pass, generally on highly polished rolls. 
12.1.3 Bright Annealed Finish-A bright cold-rolled finish 
retained by final annealing in a controlled atmosphere furnace. 
12.1.4 TR Finish-Cold-worked to obtain specified proper­
ties. 
12.1.5 Polished Finish-Stainless steel strip is also avail­
able in polished finishes such as Nos. 3 and 4, which are 
explained in Note 3. 
789 
Norn 4--Explanation of Strip Finishes: 
No. I-Appearance of this finish varies from dull gray matte finish to 
a fairly reflective surface, depending largely upon composition. This finish 
is used for severely drawn or formed parts, as well as for applications 
where the brighter No. 2 finish is not required, such as parts for heat 
resistance .. 
No. 2-This finish has a smoother and more reflective surface, the 
appearance of which varies with composition. This is a general purpose 
finish, widely used for household and automotive trim, tableware, utensils, 
trays, and so forth. 
Bright Annealed Finish-See Note 3. 
TR Finish-See Note 3.

SA-480/SA-480M (ASTM A480/ A480M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
13. Finish for Plates 
13.1 The types of finish available on plates are: 
13.1.1 Hot-rolled or Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat 
Treated-Scale not removed, an intermediate finish. Use of 
plates in this condition is generally confined to heat-resisting 
applications. Scale impairs corrosion resistance. 
13.1.2 Hot-rolled or Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat 
Treated, and Blast Cleaned or Pickled-Condition and finish 
commonly preferred for corrosion-resisting and most heat­
resisting applications, essentially a No. 1 finish. 
13.1.3 Hot-rolled or Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat 
Treated, and Su,face Cleaned and Polished-Polish finish is 
generally No. 4 finish. 
13.1.4 Hot-rolled or Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat 
Treated, and Descaled, and Temper Passed-Smoother finish 
for specialized applications. 
13.1.5 Hot-rolled or Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat 
Treated, and Descaled; and Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat 
Treated, and Descaled, and Optionally Temper Passed­
Smooth finish with greater freedom from surface imperfections 
than in 13.1.4. 
14. Edges for Cold-rolled Strip 
14.1 The types of edges available on strip products are: 
14.1.1 No. 1 Edge-A rolled edge, either round or square as 
sp1ecified. 
14.1.2 No. 3 Edge-An edge produced by slitting. 
14.1.3 No. 5 Edge-An approximately square edge pro­
duced by rolling or filing after slitting. 
15. Heat Treatment 
15.1 The heat treatments shown in this section are to be 
followed unless otherwise specified in the applicable material 
specification. Heat treatment thermal cycles shall be separate 
from other thermal processing cycles; for example, in-process 
thermal cycles are not permitted as a substitute for the separate 
annealing cycle. 
15.2 Austenitic Types: 
15.2.1 The austenitic types shall be annealed in accordance 
with Table Al.2. 
15.2.2 The material shall be annealed to meet the mechani­
cal property requirements of the applicable material specifica­
tion unless otherwise stated in the material specification. 
15.2.3 Except as indicated in Table Al.2, Series 300, 
XM-15, N08800, S30415, S30815, S31725, S31726, and 
S32615 austenitic chromium-nickel steels, when specified on 
the purchase order, shall be capable of meeting the test for 
resistance to intergranular corrosion specified in 18.2. 
15.2.4 For grades stabilized with titanium or niobium, refer 
to Note 5. 
NoTE 5-Solution-annealing temperatures above 1950 °F [1066 °C] 
can impair the resistance to intergranular corrosion after subsequent 
exposure to sensitizing conditions in the stabilized grades, types 309Cb, 
309HCb, 310Cb, 310HCb, 316Ti, 316Cb, 321, 321H, 347, 347H, 348, 
348H, S21640, S31740, S33425, S35140, S35135, and S35125. When 
intergranular corrosion is of concern, the purchaser should specify the 
corrosion test of 18.2 (to be conducted on sensitized specimens). The 
manufacturer is permitted, if necessary, use a lower temperature resolution 
anneal or a stabilization anneal after a high temperature solution anneal in 
order to meet corrosion test requirements. Consideration should be given 
to the corrosive media before using a stabilization anneal at less than 
1800 °F [982 °C], as such treatment is not equally effective for all media. 
15.2.5 For the stabilized H types, it is noted that the heat 
treatment requirements shown in Table Al.2 differ as a 
function of whether the material was cold worked or hot 
finished. 
15.2.6 The chromium-manganese-nickel types (201, 202, 
S20103, S20400, S20153, S21800, S21640, XM-11, XM-17, 
XM-18, XM-19, XM-29, and XM-31) shall be solution an­
nealed to meet the mechanical property requirements of the 
applicable material specification and to exhibit adequate resis­
tance to intergranular corrosion (see 18.2). For S20161, the 
heat treatment is specified in Table Al.2. For S21640, see Note 
5. 
15.2.6.1 Note that some of these types contain high carbon 
content that can adversely affect resistance to intergranular 
corrosion. 
15.3 Duplex Types-The duplex types shall be solution 
annealed in accordance with Table Al.2. 
15.4 Martensitic and Ferritic Types: 
15.4.1 The chromium steels (S32803, 400 Series, S40945, 
S~1045, S41050, S41500, S43932, S44400, S44537, S44635, 
S44660, S44700, S44735, S44800,XM-27, andXM-33) shall 
be heat treated in such a manner as to satisfy all the require­
ments for mechanical and bending properties specified in the 
applicable material specification and ( except for 400 Series, 
S41050, and S41500) to provide for adequate resistance to 
intergranular attack. 
790 
15.4.2 For S41500, heat to 1750 °F [955 °C] minimum, air 
cool to 200 °F [93 °C] or lower prior to any optional interme­
diate temper and prior to final temper. The final temper shall be 
between 1050 °F and 1150 °F [566 °C and 621 °C]. 
16. Number of Tests 
16.1 Unless otherwise specified by the applicable material 
specification or by agreement between the seller and the 
purchaser to perform a greater number of tests, the following 
number of tests are to be performed. 
16.1.1 In the case of plate, sheet, and strip produced in coil 
form, two or more hardness tests ( one from each end of the 
coil); one bend test, when required; one permeability test, when 
required; and one or more tension tests shall be made on 
specimens taken from each coil. If the hardness difference 
between the two ends of the coil exceeds 5 HRB, or equivalent, 
or if the material is temper rolled, tensile properties must be 
determined on both coil ends. 
16.1.2 In the case of plate, sheet, or strip produced in cut 
lengths, one tension test; two tension tests if the material is 
temper rolled (one tension test for single piece lots); one bend 
test when required, and one or more hardness tests shall be 
made on each 100 or less pieces of the same heat and nominal 
thickness rolled separately or continuously and heat treated 
within the same operating period, either as a lot or continu­
ously. 
NO'IE 6--The term continuously, as applied to heat treatment is meant 
to describe a heat-treating operation in which one cut length follows

=== Page 893 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-480/SA-480M (ASTM A480/A480M) 
another through the furnace. Interspersement of different melts is permis­
sible if they are of approximately the same nominal thickness and are heat 
treated in the same operating period and under the same conditions ( time 
and temperature). 
16.1.3 One intergranular corrosion test, when required, shall 
be selected from each heat and thickness subjected to the same 
heat treatment practice. It is permitted to obtain such speci­
mens from specimens selected for mechanical testing. 
17. Test Specimens 
17.1 Tension Test: 
17 .1.1 Tension test specimens shall be taken from finished 
material and shall be selected in either or both longitudinal and 
transverse direction. The tension test specimen shall conform 
to the appropriate sections of Test Methods and Definitions 
A370, unless otherwise specified in the applicable material 
specification or agreed upon by the seller and the purchaser. 
17 .1.2 The testing speed between the yield strength and the 
fracture of the specimen, shall be conducted at a constant strain 
rate between 1/s in. and ½ in. [3.18 mm and 12.70 mm] 
inclusive, per in. [25.40 mm] of gauge length per minute, or at 
a crosshead speed that will give a strain rate within this range. 
For the purposes of this specification, the rate of strain shall be 
determined by a strain-rate pacer, indicator, or controller, or by 
dividing the unit elongation by the elapsed time from yield 
strength to fracture. 
17.2 Hardness Test-It is permitted to perform hardness 
tests on the grip ends of the tension specimens before they are 
subjected to the tension test. 
17.2.1 Unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, the 
manufacturer may use an alternate hardness test procedure 
when material size or form dictates. Hardness conversion shall 
be done using the applicable tables in Test Methods and 
Definitions A370. When the material is too thin to allow 
hardness testing using any of the Rockwell superficial hardness 
tests, the hardness requirement is waived. 
17.3 Bend Test: 
17.3,1 Bend test specimens (when required) shall be taken 
from finished material and shall be selected in the transverse 
direction or as indicated in the applicable material specification 
or as agreed upon by the seller and the purchaser. In the case 
of transverse bend test specimens, the axis of bend shall be 
parallel to the direction of rolling. 
17.3.2 Bend test specimens from sheet and strip product 
shall be the full thickness of the material and approximately 
1 in. [25.4 mm] in width. It is permitted to round the edges of 
the test specimen to a radius equal to one half the specimen 
thickness. 
17.3.3 The width of strip for which bend tests can be made 
is subject to practical limitations on the length of the bend test 
specimen. For narrow strip, the following widths can be tested: 
Minimum Strip Width 
Strip Thickness, in. [mm] and Minimum Specimen Length for 
Bend Tests, in. [mm] 
0.100 [2.5] and under ½ [12.7] 
Over 0.100 to 0.140 [2.5 to 3.5], excl 1 [25.4] 
0.140 [3.5] and over 1 ½ [38.1] 
Bend test specimens shall be of any suitable length over the 
specified minimum length. 
17.3.4 Bend test specimens taken from plates shall be in full 
thickness of the material up to and including ½ in. [12.7 mm] 
in thickness, of suitable length, and between 1 in. and 2 in. 
[25.4 mm and 50.8 mm] in width. It is permitted to remove the 
sheared edges to a depth of at least 1/s in. [3.2 mm] and it is 
permitted to smooth the sides with a file. It is permitted to 
break the corners of the cross section of the specimen with a 
file, but no appreciable rounding of the corners is permitted. 
17.3.5 In the case of plates over ½in. [12.7 mm] in 
thickness, it is permitted to use bend test specimens, machined 
to 1 in. [25.4 mm] nominal width by½ in. [12.7 mm] nominal 
thickness and at least 6 in. [152.4 mm] in length. One surface, 
to be the outside surface in bending, shall be the original 
surface of the plate; however, surface preparation by light 
grinding is permitted. It is permitted to round the edges to a 
1/16 in. [1.6 mm] radius. When agreed by the seller and the 
purchaser, it is permitted to modify the cross section to ½ in. 
[12.7 mm] nominal square. 
17.3.6 In the case of plates over 1 in. [25.4 mm] in 
thickness, bend tests must be agreed upon between the seller 
and the purchaser. 
17.3.7 The bend test specimen shall withstand cold bending 
through the angle specified in the applicable material specifi­
cation without cracking on the outside of the bent portion. 
17.4 The bend shall be made over a diameter equal to the 
number of thicknesses of flat stock shown in the applicable 
material specification or over a single piece of flat stock equal 
to the number of thicknesses shown in the applicable material 
specification; or as follows: 
17.4.1 Material up to and including 3/s in. [9.5 mm] in 
thickness shall be bent over a piece ( or pieces) of flat stock that 
has the same nominal thickness of the material being tested 
(1 T), allowing the test material to form its natural curvature. 
17.4.2 Material over 3 /s in. [9.5 mm] and up to and including 
1 in. [25.4 mm] in thickness shall be bent over a piece (or 
pieces) of flat stock equalling two times the thickness of the 
material being tested (2T), allowing the test material to form its 
natural curvature. 
18. Special Tests 
18.1 If other tests are required, the methods and acceptance 
criteria shall be agreed upon between the seller and the 
purchaser and specified on the purchase order. 
791 
18.2 Resistance to Intergranular Corrosion: 
18.2.1 The intergranular corrosion test, Practice E of Prac­
tices A262, is not required unless it is specified on the purchase 
order. All austenitic chromium-nickel types except the H types 
are expected to be capable of passing this test. However, it is 
not necessary to actually run the test unless it is specified on the 
purchase order. Note that Practices A262 requires the test to be 
performed on sensitized specimens in the low-carbon and 
stabilized types and on specimens representative of the as­
shipped condition for other types. In the case of low-carbon 
types containing 3 % or more molybdenum in their specified

time. 
25. Packaging, Marking, and Loading 
25.1 For Commercial Procurement: 
25.1.1 Marking-Unless otherwise specified in the appli­
cable material specification or the purchase order, marking 
shall be conducted as follows: 
25.1.1.1 Sheet, strip, and plate shall be marked on one face, 
in the location indicated below with the specification designa­
tion number, type of steel (type or UNS designation), material 
identification number, and the name or mark of the manufac­
turer. For sheet, strip, and plate whose length and width 
dimensions are both less than 24 in., each piece shall be 
marked with the type of steel and material identification 
number. The specification and designation number, and name 
or mark of the manufacturer shall be marked on the piece(s) or 
attached to the item or bundle. The characters shall be of such 
size as to be clearly legible. The marking shall be sufficiently 
stable to withstand normal handling. Unless otherwise speci­
fied by the purchaser, the marking, at the producers option, is 
permitted to be done with (J) marking fluid (if a specific 
maximum impurity limit of designated elements in the marking 
fluid is required by the purchaser, it shall be so stated on the 
purchase order), (2) low-stress blunt-nosed continuous or 
low-stress blunt-nosed-interrupted-dot die stamp, (3) a vibra­
tory tool with a minimum tip radius of 0.005 in. [0.1 mm], or 
(4) electrochemical etching. 
25.1.1.2 Flat sheet, strip in cut lengths, and plate shall be 
marked in two places near the ends or shall be continuously 
line marked along one edge. For flat sheet, strip in cut lengths, 
and plate whose length and width dimensions are both less than 
48 in., it is permitted to mark such pieces in only one place. 
25.1.1.3 Sheet, strip, and plate in coil form shall be marked 
near the outside end of the coil. The inside of the coil shall also 
be marked or shall have a tag or label attached and marked with 
the information of 25.1.1.1. 
25.1.1.4 Material less than¼ in. [6.4 mm] in thickness shall 
not be marked with die stamps. 
25.1.1.5 The manufacturer's test identification number shall 
be legibly stamped on each test specimen, if to be shipped to 
the customer. 
25.1.1.6 Material that conforms completely with the re­
quirements of two types of steel within the ordering specifica­
tion is permitted to be marked as both types of steel provided 
that the manufacturer is certifying the material as meeting the 
requirements of each of the types of steel. Such marking, if 
used, shall be part of the same marking as used for a single type 
of steel, or shall be a separate but similar marking immediately 
adjacent to the marking used for a single type of steel. 
25. 1.1 .7 The AIAG primary metals identification tag (AIAG 
B-5) is permitted to be used as an auxiliary method of 
identification in cases where a bar-coded identification tag is 
desired. Use of this method shall be by agreement between 
purchaser and supplier. 
25.1.2 Packaging and Loading-Unless otherwise speci­
fied in the applicable material specification or the purchase 
order, packaging, and loading shall be in accordance with the 
procedures recommended by Practices A700.

NOTE 5-Solution-annealing temperatures above 1950 ?F [1066 ?C] can impair the resistance to intergranular corrosion after subsequent exposure to sensitizing conditions in the stabilized grades, types 309Cb, 309HCb, 310Cb, 310HCb, 316Ti, 316Cb, 321, 321H, 347, 347H, 348, 348H, S21640, S31740, S33425, S35140, S35135, and S35125. When intergranular corrosion is of concern, the purchaser should specify the corrosion test of 18.2 (to be conducted on sensitized specimens). The manufacturer is permitted, if necessary, use a lower temperature resolution anneal or a stabilization anneal after a high temperature solution anneal in order to meet corrosion test requirements. Consideration should be given to the corrosive media before using a stabilization anneal at less than 1800 ?F [982 ?C], as such treatment is not equally effective for all media.

SA·484/SA-484M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
General Requirements for Stainless Steel Bars, Billets, and 
Forgings 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers general requirements that 
shall apply to wrought stainless steel bars, shapes, forgings, 
and billets or other semi-finished material (except wire) for 
forging, under each of the following specifications issued by 
ASTM: Specifications A276/A276M, A314, A458, A477, 
A479/A479M, A564/A564M, A565/A565M, A582/A582M, 
A638/A638M, A705/A705M, and A831/A831M. 
1.2 In the case of conflict between a requirement of a 
product specification and a requirement of this specification, 
the product specification shall prevail. In the case of conflict 
between a requirement of the product specification or a 
requirement of this specification and a more stringent require­
ment of the purchase order, the purchase order shall prevail. 
The purchase order requirements shall not take precedence if 
they, in any way, violate the requirements of the product 
specification or this specification; for example, by waiving a 
test requirement or by making a test requirement less stringent. 
1.3 The requirements for introduction of new materials in 
specifications referencing this specification are given in Annex 
Al. 
1.4 General requirements for flat-rolled stainless steel prod­
ucts other than bar are covered in Specification A480/ A480M. 
1.5 General requirements for wire products in coils are 
covered in Specification A555/A555M. 
1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other, and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined 
1.7 Unless the order specifies an "M" designation, the 
material shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

enough to prevent unacceptable grain boundary carbide pre­
cipitation. Except as indicated in Table 2, austenitic stainless 
steels solution annealed by process annealing shall be capable 
of meeting the requirements of Practice E of Practices A262. 
Practice E of Practices A262 is not required unless specified on 
the purchase order. 
7.2.3 For the stabilized grades, Types 321, 321H, 347, 
347H, 348, and 348H, the manufacturer is permitted, if 
necessary, to use a lower temperature resolution anneal or a 
stabilization anneal after a high temperature anneal in order to 
maximize resistance to intergranular corrosion. 
NOTE 2-Solution annealing temperatures above 1950 °F [1065 °C] 
may impair the resistance to intergranular corrosion aft.er subsequent 
exposure to sensitizing conditions for the stabilized grades. When inter-
granular corrosion is of concern, the purchaser should specify Practice E 
of Practices A262 ( to be conducted on specimens exposed to a sensitizing 
treatment). Consideration should be given to the corrosive media before 
using a stabilization anneal at less than 1800 °F [980 °C], as such a 
treatment may not be fully effective for all media. 
7.2.4 Strain-hardened Austenitic Grades-When a particu­
lar austenitic grade is desired with increased mechanical 
properties, the purchaser is permitted to specify a strain 
hardened condition. This condition is produced by solution 
annealing the product in accordance with Table 2, followed by 
strain hardening sufficient to meet the required mechanical 
properties. Annealing in accordance with Table 2 is permitted 
between strain hardening steps. The solution annealed and 
strain hardened material shall be capable of meeting the 
intergranular corrosion test requirements of Practice E of

7.3.2.2 Process annealing shall consist of completing hot 
working above the minimum annealing temperature required 
for each grade as indicated in Table 2, and cooling rapidly 
enough to prevent unacceptable precipitation of intermetallic 
phases. 
7.4 Ferritic Grades-Ferritic grades shall be annealed to 
meet their respective mechanical testing requirements as 
shown in the applicable product specification. 
7.5 Martensitic Grades: 
7.5.1 All martensitic grades shall be supplied in either the 
annealed condition or in the tempered condition as specified by 
the purchaser. Tempered material shall be normalized, or shall 
be liquid quenched from 1700 °F [925 °C], minimum, fol­
lowed by tempering in accordance with 7.5.2, 7.5.3, or 7.5.4. 
7.5.2 Types 403 and 410 tempered material shall be held at 
the tempering temperature for at least 1 h/in. [25.4 mm] of 
cross section as follows: 
7.5.2.1 Condition 1-1250 °F [675 °C] minimum; 1400 °F 
[760 °C] maximum. 
7.5.2.2 Condition 2-1100 °F [595 °C] minimum, 1400 °F 
[760 °C] maximum. 
7.5.2.3 Condition 3-1050 °F [565 °C] minimum, 1400 °F 
[760 °C] maximum. 
7.5.3 Types XM-30, 414, and 431 tempered materials shall 
be held at 1100 °F [595 °C], minimum for at least 1 h/in. 
[25 mm] of cross section. Maximum tempering temperature 
shall be 1400 °F [7 60 °C]. 
7.5.4 S41500 shall be heated to 1750 °F [955 °C] minimum, 
air cooled to 200 °F [95 °C] or lower prior to any optional 
intermediate temper and prior to the final temper. The final 
temper shall be between 1050 and 1150 °F [565 and 620 °C]. 
7.5.5 When the purchaser elects to perform the hardening 
and tempering heat treatment, martensitic materials shall be 
supplied by the manufacturer in the annealed condition (see 
7.5.1). In this case the purchaser shall be responsible to apply 
the proper heat treatment and to conduct the tests deemed 
necessary to assure that the required properties are obtained. 
8. Finish 
8.1 The following types of finishes are permitted, as appli­
cable to the product ordered: 
8.1.1 Hot-finished Bars-Hot-finished bars shall have the 
surface finish that results from hot processing, with or without 
certain additional surface modification. Hot-finished bars are 
commonly produced by hot rolling, forging, pressing, 
extruding, or similar hot working procedures applied to ingots, 
blooms, or billets. The resulting products are typically subject 
to various additional operations affecting the surface of the 
bars, including but not limited to one or more of the following: 
annealing or other heat treatment; cleaning by blasting, 
pickling, or other descaling methods; rough turning; and 
machine straightening. The producer is permitted to use 
centerless grinding, polishing, or other operations commonly 
associated with cold finishing in order to provide improved 
dimensional tolerances or surface condition for the hot-finished 
bar. The dimensional tolerances applicable to hot-finished bars 
are less stringent than those applicable to cold-finished bars. 
8.1.2 Bars Cut from Strip or Plate-Bars cut from flat-rolled 
stainless steel products shall have two surfaces that are pickled 
or descaled, and two cut surfaces, except when the bar is heat 
treated subsequent to cutting, in which case all surfaces shall 
be descaled or pickled. 
8.1.3 Cold-finished Bar-Cold-finished bars shall have the 
surface finish that results from hot-finished bars being further 
processed by additional mechanical operations on the surface 
of the bar, including but not limited to light cold drawing, 
burnishing, centerless grinding, and polishing to provide closer 
tolerances and improved surface finish. The dimensional tol­
erances applicable to cold-finished bars are more stringent than 
those applicable to hot-finished bars. 
8.1.4 Bars and Billets or Other Semi-finished Material for 
Reforging-Material intended for reforging shall be delivered 
in the hot-finished condition or in the cold-drawn condition. 
The cold-drawn condition alternative is only permitted for 
austenitic and austenitic-ferritic stainless steel forgings. When 
delivered in the hot-finished condition, it is permitted to 
condition the surface by removing surface defects provided 
that the depth of the conditioning does not exceed that which 
affects the surface condition or dimensions of the article to be 
forged from the bar or billet. When delivered in the cold-drawn 
condition, it is permitted to hot forge forgings from cold-drawn 
bar provided this bar has been cold-drawn from material in the 
solution-annealed condition. 
8.1.5 Shapes-Shapes shall be descaled by machining, 
grinding, blasting, or pickling. 
8.1.5.1 Shapes shall be subject to either Class A or Class C 
surface preparation as specified on the purchase order. Class A 
consists of grinding for the removal of imperfections of a 
hazardous nature, such as fins, tears, and jagged edges, 
provided the underweight tolerance is not exceeded and the 
maximum depth of grinding at any one point does not exceed 
10 % of the thickness of the section. Class C consists of 
grinding for the removal of all visible surface imperfections, 
provided that the underweight tolerance is not exceeded and 
the maximum depth of grinding at any point does not exceed 
10 % of the thickness of the section. 
8.1.6 Forgings-Forgings shall be descaled by machining, 
blasting, or pickling. The selection of the descaling methods 
shall be at the option of the producer unless a particular 
descaling method is specified in the purchase order. 
819 
9. Dimensions, Mass, and Permissible Variations 
9.1 Unless otherwise specified on the purchase order, the 
material shall conform to the permitted variations in dimen­
sions as specified in the following: 
9.1.1 Bars-Tables 3-12. 
9.1.2 Shapes-Tables 13-19 and Figs. 1 and 2. 
9.1.3 Forgings-As specified in the purchase order, or in 
prints or sketches accompanying the purchase order. 
9.1.4 Billets or Other Semi-finished Material for 
Reforging-Billets and other semi-finished material shall con­
form to the shape and dimensions specified by the purchaser 
within a permitted variation of ±5 %.

Xl. RATIONALE REGARDING DEFINITION OF LOT FOR MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND CORROSION TESTING 
Xl.1 It is generally recognized that material described as a 
lot must be "produced under the same processing conditions," 
which means the same manufacturing order number, same size, 
same heat, same heat-treating procedure, and same subsequent 
processing. Under those conditions, single samples can be 
selected to be representative of the total lot, with at least one 
sample for each 20 000 pounds of material. 
Xl.2 Following the principle described in Xl.1 generally 
requires that the producer control each of several furnace loads 
constituting the same lot so that: • 
Xl.2.1 Set point temperature and process tolerance match, 
Xl.2.2 Time at temperature for all thermal treatment shall 
match within 10 %, 
Xl.2.3 All furnaces used be similar in size and meet the 
uniformity requirements of a documented furnace quality 
assurance program, and 
Xl .2.4 The quench systems are the same with respect to 
volume, type of quenchant, and circulation rate. 
Xl.2.5 Further, it would be expected that grouped loads be 
handled within a relatively short time period, and that hardness 
testing be performed on at least one sample per charge. 
Xl .3 The old definition of a lot for mechanical testing based 
on simply the words "same size, heat, and heat treatment 
charge in a batch furnace" assumes that heat treating is the only 
process affecting properties. This kind of definition ignores the 
effects of other processing, prior to and subsequent to heat 
treating. Moreover, it assumes that each heat-treated batch will 
be uniform and unique rather than reproducible. In reality, heat 
treating is a process which can be controlled easily throughout 
a batch and from batch to batch, with the net result that 
multiple batches can be considered part of a single lot if 
equipment and processing parameters meet the mandates of 
Xl.1 and Xl.2. 
Xl.4 The sampling specified for mechanical properties is 
not a statistical sampling plan. Therefore, it provides only 
typical data. Assurance of uniformity within the lot can be 
obtained only by the producer adequately controlling the 
processing parameters. 
X2. BAR CODING 
X2.1 Bar coding to identify steel is not specifically ad­
dressed in Committee A0l specifications. Committee A0l 
endorses the AIAG bar code standard for primary metals for 
826 
steel products and proposes that this bar coding standard be 
considered as a possible auxiliary method of identification.
