SA-737 /SA-737M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, High-Strength, Low-Alloy Steel 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers high-strength low-alloy steel 
plates for service in welded pressure vessels and piping 
components. 
1.2 This material is particularly intended for piping and 
pressure vessel applications where high strength and improved 
toughness are required. 
1.3 Two grades, designated B and C, are covered by this 
specification. Grade B provides a minimum yield strength of 
50 ksi [345 MPa]. Grade C provides a minimum yield strength 
of 60 ksi [415 MPa]. 
1.4 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the chemical composition and heat treatment to 
meet the specified mechanical property requirements; however, 
current practice normally limits the maximum thickness to 4 in. 
[100 mm] for each grade. 
1.5 Grade C in the as-rolled condition is sensitive to 
cracking during flame cutting, transit, and handling, particu­
larly in thicknesses over 2 in. [50 mm]. Plates should not be 
shipped in the as-rolled condition only except by mutual 
agreement between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M. These require­
ments outline the testing and retesting methods and procedures, 
permitted variations in dimensions and mass, quality, repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and 
shall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of 
Specification A20/ A20M. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5 .1 The material shall be normalized by heating to a suitable 
temperature which produces an austenitic structure, but not 
exceeding 1700°F [925°C], holding a sufficient time to attain 
uniform heat throughout the material, and cooling in air.

men may be used for the tension test, and the elongation may 
be determined in a 2-in. [50-mm] gage length that includes the 
fracture and that shows the greatest elongation.

Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Heat-Treated, Carbon-Manganese­
Silicon Steel, for Moderate and Lower Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers heat-treated carbon­
manganese-silicon steel plates intended for use in welded 
pressure vessels at moderate and lower temperature service. 
1.2 Material under this specification is available in four 
strength levels, 75 ksi [515 MPa], 85 ksi [585 MPa], 80 ksi 
[550 MPa], and 90 ksi [620 MPa] minimum ultimate tensile 
strengths. 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates for Grades A, B, and 
C is limited only by the capacity of the chemical composition 
and heat treatment to meet the specified mechanical property 
requirements; however, current practice normally limits the 
maximum thickness of plates furnished under this specification 
to 6 in. [150 mm] for Grade A, 4 in. [100 mm] for Grade B, and 
6 in. [150 mm] for Grade C. The maximum permitted nominal 
thickness is 1.5 in. [40 mm] for Grade D and 2 in. [50 mm] for 
Grade E. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical

the same size from each heat in each heat treatment charge. For 
continuous heat-treated material, not fewer than two tension 
tests shall represent a lot selected on the basis of one tension 
test from each 10 000 lb (4500 kg). 
6.3.2 When heat treated without interruption in continuous 
furnaces, the material in a lot shall be from the same heat, same 
prior condition, same size, and subjected to the same heat 
treatments. 
6.4 Test Methods-Tension test~ shall be made in accor­
dance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. The yield 
strength shall be determined by the 0.2 % offset method. 
7. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
7 .1 Wbrkmanship-The bars shall be free of pipe, cracks, 
and flakes. Within the limits of good manufacturing and 
inspection practices the bars shall be free of injurious seams, 
laps, segregation, or other imperfections which, due to their 
nature, degree or extent, will interfere with the use of the 
material in machining or fabrication. 
7.2 Descaling-Unless otherwise specified, the bars shall be 
descaled. 
8. General Requirements 
8.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A29/ A29M. 
9. Certification and Test Reports 
9.1 A manufacturer's certification that the material was 
manufactured and tested in accordance with this specification 
together with a report of the analysis and tensfon test results 
shall be furnished at the time of shipment. The report shall 
include the name of the manufacturer, ASTM designation 
number and year date and revision letter, if any, grade, heat 
number, and size. 
10. Product Marking 
10.1 The bars shall be marked in accordance with Specifi­
cation A29/ A29M except as modified or supplemented by 10.2 
through 10.4 of this specification. 
10.2 When specified by the purchaser, the heat number shall 
be permanently stamped on one end of each bar 2.50 in. and 
larger in nominal diameter (or equivalent cross-sectional area). 
10.3 The bars shall neither be hot nor cold stamped on the 
sides unless approved by the purchaser on the purchase order. 
10.4 Each lift, regardless of size, shall be tagged with the 
information required by Specification A29/ A29M.
