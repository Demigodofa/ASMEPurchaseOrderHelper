1.3 The purchaser may specify additional requirements (see 
4.2.3) that do not negate any of the provisions of either this 
specification or of the individual product specifications. The 
acceptance of any such additional requirements shall be 
dependent on negotiations with the supplier and must be 
included in the order. 
1.4 If, by agreement, forgings are to be supplied in a 
partially completed condition, that is, all of the provisions of 
the product specification have not been filled, then the material 
marking (see Section 17) and certification (see Section 16) 
shall reflect the extent to which the product specification 
requirements have been met. 
1.5 As noted in the Certification Section (16), the number 
and year date of this specification, as well as that of the product 
specification, are required to be included in the product 
certification. 
1.6 When the SI version of a product specification is 
required by the purchase order, Specification A788/A788M 
shall be used in conjunction with Test Methods A1058 instead 
of Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
1. 7 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.8 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica­
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Terminology A941 is applicable to this specification. 
Additional terms and wording more applicable to forgings are 
as noted in this section. 
3.2 Forging Definitions: 
3.2.1 steel forging, n-the product of a substantially com­
pressive plastic working operation that consolidates the mate­
rial and produces the desired shape. The plastic working may 
be performed by a hammer, press, forging machine, or ring 
rolling machine, and must deform the material to produce an 
essentially wrought structure. 
3.2.1.1 Discussion-Hot rolling operations may be used to 
produce blooms or billets for reforging. 
3.3 Forging Geometries: 
3.3.1 bar forging, n-forging that has no bore and having an 
axial length greater than its maximum cross sectional dimen­
sion. 
3.3.1.1 Discussion-More than one cross sectional shape or 
size may be included. Sometimes referred to as a solid forging. 
3.3.2 disk forging, n-forging, sometimes referred to as a 
pancake forging, that has (a) an axial length appreciably less 
than its diameter, (b) may be dished on one or both faces, and 
( c) final forging includes upsetting operations to reduce the 
height of the stock and increase its diameter. 
3.3.2.1 Discussion-Since much of the hot working is done 
in axially compressing the stock, the central area may not 
receive sufficient consolidation. To counter this effect, consid­
eration is usually given to the initial saddening (see 3.3.6) of 
the ingot or billet. 
3.3.3 hollow forging, n-forging (also known as a shell 
forging or a mandrel forging) in which (a) the axial length is 
equal to or greater than the diameter, and (b) the forging length 
and wall thickness are produced by hot working over a mandrel 
(usually water cooled) such that the bore diameter remains 
essentially the same as that of the mandrel. 
3.3.3.1 Discussion-Unless a hollow ingot has been used, 
the starting slug is hot trepanned or punched after upsetting and 
the bore diameter adjusted to suit the forging mandrel. The 
outside diameter may be contoured if required. The workpiece 
is forged between the upper die and lower dies while the 
mandrel is supported by cranes or manipulators to facilitate 
rotation. 
3.3.4 ring forging, n-type of hollow forging in which (a) 
the axial length is less than the diameter, (b) the wall thickness 
is reduced, and ( c) the outside diameter is increased by hot 
working between the top die and a mandrel supported on 
temporary saddles. 
3.3.4.1 Discussion-Forging between the top die and the 
mandrel enables the ring diameter to be increased while 
reducing the wall thickness, without increasing the axial 
length. 
3.3.5 ring rolling, n-involves the use of specialized equip­
ment whereby a hot punched, trepanned, or bored disk is ( a) 
hot worked between a powered outer roller and an idling inner 
roller, such that the wall thickness is reduced and the outside 
diameter is increased, and (b) the axial length of the ring is not 
1274

=== Page 1337 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-788/SA-788M 
intended to increase and may be contained by a radially 
oriented tapered roller. 
3.3.6 saddening, n-term used in the open die forging 
industry to describe the initial hot working of an ingot for 
surface compaction and flute working surface prior to full 
working of the ingot cross section. 
3.3.6.1 Discussion-The term is also extended to initial hot 
working intended to give consolidation of ingot central areas 
prior to upsetting when making products such as turbine and 
generator rotors and tube sheets. 
3.3.7 slab forging, n-forging, sometimes referred to as a 
forged plate, that is usually square or rectangular in shape, with 
a thickness appreciably smaller than the other dimension. The 
hot working may include upsetting. 
3.4 billets and blooms, n-interchangeable terms represent­
ing hot-worked semi-finished product intended as a starting 
stock for making forgings. 
3.4.1 Discussion-No size limitations are assumed for ei­
ther term. Cast shapes produced by a continuous casting 
process, without subsequent work, are considered to be ingots 
for the purposes of this specification, and if supplied as billets 
or blooms must carry the descriptor Cast Billet or Cast Bloom. 
3.5 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.5.1 bottom pouring, n-steel from a single heat, or from a 
multiple heat tapped into a common ladle (see 8.1.1 and 8.1.2), 
introduced into ingot mold(s) such that they are filled from the 
bottom up. One or more molds can be set up on an individual 
plate, and more than one plate may be poured in sequence from 
a heat. 
3.5.2 ingot, n-the product obtained when molten steel, 
upon being cast into a mold, is subsequently capable of being 
wrought in conformance with 3.1. Open-ended molds, which 
are usually cooled and used, for example, in the continuous 
casting of steel, are considered to be included in this definition. 
3.5.3 intercritical heat treatment, n-use of a multi-stage 
heat treatment procedure in which the material is first austen­
itized at a temperature above the upper critical temperature 
(Ac3) followed by cooling below the lower critical temperature 
(Acl). The material is then reheated to a temperature in the 
intercritical range between the Acl and the Ac3 and again 
cooled below the Ac 1, followed by subcritical tempering in the 
range specified in the material specification. 
3.5.3.1 Discussion-This procedure is generally applicable 
to low hardenability carbon and low alloy steels that would 
usually have a microstructure of ferrite and pearlite in the heat 
treated section size of the component being heat treated. 
3.5.4 precipitation deoxidation, n-steelmaking process in 
which primary deoxidation is achieved by the addition of 
strong deoxidizing agents, such as aluminum, early in the 
process, and holding the steel in the molten state for sufficient 
time for the products of deoxidation to separate from the melt 
to the slag. 
3.5.5 sequential or continuous strand casting, n-steel from 
several heats poured consecutively into a cooled open-ended 
mold to form a continuous cast product with a change from 
heat to heat along its length (see 8.1.5). 
3.5.6 strand casting, n-steel from one heat poured into a 
cooled open-ended mold to form a continuous strand or 
strands. 
3.5.7 vacuum carbon deoxidation (VCD), n-steelmaking 
process in which primary deoxidation occurs during vacuum 
treatment as a result of the carbon-oxygen reaction. In order for 
primary deoxidation to occur during vacuum treatment, deoxi­
dizing agents such as aluminum or silicon are not to be added 
to the melt in any significant amount prior to the vacuum 
treatment operation. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It shall be the responsibility of the purchaser to specify 
all requirements that are necessary for forgings under the 
applicable product specification. Such requirements to be 
considered include, but are not restricted to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity, 
4.1.2 Dimensions, including tolerances and surface finishes. 
4.1.3 Specification number with type, class, and grade as 
applicable (including year date), and should include: 
4.1.4 Number of copies of the material test report. 
4.1.5 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test 
Methods A1058 when forgings are ordered to a suffix M 
product standard. If the choice of test track is not made in the 
ordering information then the default ASTM track shall be used 
as noted in Test Methods A1058. 
4.2 Additional information including the following may be 
added by agreement with the supplier: 
4.2.1 Type of heat treatment when alternative methods are 
allowed by the product specification, 
4.2.2 Supplementary requirements, if any, and 
4.2.3 Additional requirements (see 1.4, 16.1.5, and 16.1.6). 
4.2.4 Repair welding NOT permitted. 
4.3 For dual format specifications, unless otherwise 
specified, the inch-pound units shall be used. 
5. Melting Process 
5.1 Unless otherwise specified in the product specification, 
the steel shall be produced by any of the following primary 
processes: electric-furnace, basic oxygen, vacuum-induction 
(VIM), or open-hearth. The primary melting may incorporate 
separate degassing or refining and may be followed by second­
ary melting, using electro slag remelting (ESR) or vacuum arc 
remelting (VAR). 
5.1.1 The steel shall be fully killed. 
5.2 The molten steel may be vacuum-treated prior to or 
during pouring of the ingot. 
5.2.1 When vacuum treatment of the molten steel is re­
quired by the product specification the following conditions 
shall apply: 
5.2.1.1 When the vacuum stream degassing process is used, 
the vacuum system must be of sufficient capacity to effect a 
blank-off pressure low enough (usually less than 1000 µm) to 
break up the normal tight, rope-like stream of molten metal 
into a wide-angled conical stream of relatively small droplets. 
1275

=== Page 1338 ===

SA-788/SA-788M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
The capacity of the system must also be sufficiently high to 
reduce the initial surge pressure at the start of the pour to a low 
level within 2 min. 
5.2.1.2 When the vacuum-lift process is utilized, the molten 
metal shall be repeatedly drawn into the evacuated vessel to 
give a recirculation factor (see Annex Al) of at least 2.5 to 
ensure thorough degassing and mixing of the entire heat. The 
evacuation system shall be capable of reducing the pressure 
surges, which occur each time a new portion of steel is 
admitted to the vessel to increasingly lower levels, until a 
blank-off pressure (usually less than 1000 µm) is achieved 
signifying the end of the degassing treatment. 
5.2.1.3 When the ladle degassing process is used, the 
evacuation system shall be capable of reducing the system 
vacuum pressure to a low level (usually less than 1000 µm). 
The molten metal shall be adequately stirred for a sufficient 
length of time to maximize exposure to the evacuated atmo­
sphere. 
5.2.1.4 Other methods of vacuum treatment may be used if 
the supplier can demonstrate adequate degassing and accept­
able properties in the finished forging to the satisfaction of the 
purchaser. 
6. Forging 
6.1 Forgings shall be made in accordance with 3.2.1. 
6.2 Because of differences in manufacture, hot-rolled, or 
hot-rolled and cold-finished bars (semi-finished or finished), 
billets, or blooms are not considered to be forgings. 
6.3 Cold worked forgings shall be made from material 
previously hot worked by forging or rolling; however, a 
hot-cold worked forging may be produced in one continuous 
operation wherein the material is first hot worked and then cold 
worked by control of the finishing temperature. 
7. Cooling Prior to Heat Treatment 
7.1 After forging and before reheating for heat treatment, 
the forgings shall be allowed to cool in such a manner as to 
prevent injury and, in the case of ferritic forgings, to permit 
substantially complete transformation of austenite. 
8. Chemical Composition 
8.1 Heat Analysis: 
8.1.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the 
steel producer to determine the percentages of those elements 
specified in the product specification. This analysis shall be 
made from a test sample preferably taken during the pouring of 
the heat and shall conform to the requirements of the product 
specification. 
8.1.2 When multiple heats are tapped into a common ladle, 
the ladle chemistry shall apply. The chemical composition thus 
determined shall conform to the requirements of the product 
specification. 
8.1.3 For multiple-heat ingots, either individual heat analy­
ses or a weighted average (see Annex A2) may be taken. The 
results of the method used shall conform to the requirements of 
the product specification. 
8.1.4 With the exception of the product from multiple heats 
sequentially cast in strand casting machines (see 8.1.5), if the 
test sample taken for a heat analysis is lost or declared 
inadequate for chemical determinations, the steel producer may 
take alternative samples from appropriate locations near the 
surface of the ingot or forging as necessary to establish the 
analysis of the heat in question. 
8.1.5 For multiple heats sequentially cast in strand casting 
machines, the heat analysis shall be determined for each 
individual heat in accordance with 8.1.1 or 8.1.2 if applicable. 
8.1.5.1 If, for multiple heats sequentially strand cast, the test 
sample is lost or declared inadequate for chemical analysis 
determination, alternative samples, remote from the transition 
zones, may be taken by the steel producer from the cast 
material or product of that heat, as defined in 8.2 or 8.3 as 
appropriate. 
8.1.6 Heat Analysis for Remelted Ingots: 
8.1.6.1 When consumable remelting processes are used, a 
chemical analysis shall be taken from a remelted ingot ( or the 
product of a remelted ingot) for the remelt heat analysis. 
8.1.6.2 When more than one electrode is prepared from a 
master or parent heat for remelting in the same facility by the 
same process, then the heat analysis obtained from one 
remelted ingot, or the product from that ingot, shall be taken as 
the heat analysis for all of the remelted ingots from that master 
heat. For analysis from each remelted ingot, see S27. 
8.1.6.3 When electrodes from different master heats are 
remelted sequentially, an analysis shall be made in each zone 
of the remelted ingot corresponding to at least one electrode 
from each master heat. The resultant chemical analysis of each 
zone shall conform to the requirements of the product specifi­
cation. The heat analysis of the remelted ingot shall be 
represented by a weighted average (see Annex A2) of the 
individual chemical analyses for each zone. 
8.1.6.4 Limits on aluminum content in remelt ingots shall be 
set as required in the product specification. 
8.2 Heat Number Assignment for Sequentially Strand Cast 
Material-When heats of the same chemical composition are 
sequentially strand cast, the heat number assigned to the cast 
product may remain unchanged until all of the steel in the 
product is from the following heat, except when Supplemen­
tary Requirement S3 is invoked. 
8.3 Identification of Material of Different Chemical Compo­
sition Ranges, Sequentially Strand Cast-Because of intermix­
ing in the tun dish, separation and identification of the resultant 
transition material is required when steels of different chemical 
composition ranges are sequentially strand cast. The steel 
producer shall remove the transition material by any estab­
lished procedure that positively separates the grades. 
8.4 Product Analysis: 
8.4.1 An analysis may be made by the purchaser from a 
forging representing each heat or multiple heat (see 8.1). 
Samples for analysis may be taken from the forging or from a 
full-size prolongation. The sampling location shall be at any 
point from the midradius to the outer surface of disk or other 
solid forgings or midway between the inner and outer surfaces 
of hollow or bored forgings. The analysis may also be taken 
from a mechanical test specimen or the mechanical test 
location as defined in the product specification.

8.4.2 The chemical composition thus detennined shall con­
form to the heat analysis requirements of the forging specifi­
cation subject to the pennissible variations specified in Table 1,

8.5 Residual and Unspecified Elements-Provisions for the 
limitation of certain residual and unspecified elements have 
been made in Supplementary Requirements Sl and S2, respec­
tively. 
8.6 Grade substitution is not permitted. 
8.7 Method of Analysis-Methods included in Test 
Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751 shall be used for 
referee purposes. 
9. Heat Treatment 
9.1 Heat treatment shall be performed as specified in the 
product specification. Supplementary Requirement S4 con­
cerns a specialized heat treat process (see 3.5.3) whose 
application will be controlled in the product specification. 
Unless otherwise specified during a heat treating hold cycle, 
the recorded furnace temperature shall be within ±25°F 
[± 15°C) of the controlling set point temperature. Material 
shall be heat treated in the working zone of a furnace that has 
been surveyed in accordance with Test Method A991/A991M 
provided that the working zone was established using a 
variation of ±25°F [± 15°C] or less from the furnace set point. 
10. Mechanical Testing 
10.1 Test Methods-Except as specified in 4.1.5 or 10.2.1 
and 10.2.2, all tests shall be conducted in accordance with Test 
Methods and Definitions A37O. When forgings are ordered to 
SI requirements (M suffix standard) Test Methods A1058 shall 
be used (see 4.1.5). 
10.1.1 In addition to the hardness testing provisions of Test 
Methods and Definitions A37O or, when required, Test Meth­
ods Al058, comparison hardness testing in accordance with 
Practice A833 may be used in determining the hardness of 
forgings. 
10.2 Fracture Appearance Transition Temperature 
( FAIT ,J-For a product specification (including M suffix SI 
specifications) that requires the determination of the fracture 
appearance transition temperature (FATT 0 ) where n is the 
required minimum percentage of shear fracture as measured on 
the fracture surface of a Charpy V-notch sample by one of the 
methods described in Test Methods and Definitions A37O, the 
Charpy test specimen location and orientation shall be as 
specified in the product standard. 
10.2.1 When the actual fracture appearance transition tem­
perature is required, break at least four specimens that have 
been taken from a comparable location. Test each specimen at 
a different temperature such that the percentage of shear 
fracture will be both above and below the value of n, but within 
a range of ±0.60 times that of the specified value of n. It is 
desirable that two of the specimens will have values of 
cleavage fracture above the value of n, and two will have 
values below this level. Plot the percentage shear fracture 
against test temperature and determine the transition tempera­
ture by interpolation (extrapolation is not permitted). 
10.2.2 When rather than calling for an actual FATTn as 
described in 10.2.1, the product specification requires a mini­
mum PATT n at a given temperature then, unless otherwise 
specified, a single test run at the required temperature satisfies 
the requirement provided that the fracture appearance value is 
at least n. For example, a single test run at 10O°F [38°C] with 
a fracture appearance of 55 % shear fracture satisfies a require­
ment of FATT 50 at 10O°F [38°C]. 
10.3 Retests-If the results of the tests do not conform to the 
requirements specified, retests are permitted as outlined in Test 
Methods and Definitions A37O or as follows: 
10.3.1 If the percentage of elongation or reduction of area of 
any tension test specimen is less than specified because a flaw 
becomes evident in the test specimen during testing, a retest 
shall be allowed provided that the defect was not attributable to 
ruptures, cracks, or flakes in the steel. 
10.3.2 If the average impact energy value meets the speci­
fication requirements, but the energy value for one specimen is 
below the specified minimum value for individual specimens 
prescribed in the material specification, a retest is permitted. 
This shall consist of two impact specimens from a location 
adjacent to and on either side of the specimen that failed. Each 
of the retested specimens must exhibit an energy value equal to 
or greater than the minimum average value required by the 
product specification. 
11. Reheat Treatment 
11.1 If the results of the initial mechanical tests do not 
conform to the specified requirements, the forgings may be 
heat treated (if initially tested in the as-forged condition) or 
reheat treated (if heat treated prior to initial testing). 
12. Repair Welding 
12.1 Repair welding of forgings is not permitted unless 
specifically allowed by the product specification (see also 
4.2.4). 
13. Dimensions and Finish 
13.1 The forgings shall conform to the dimensions, 
tolerances, and finishes required by the ordering information 
(4.1.2). Supplementary Requirements S5 or S6, concerning 
straightening of forgings, may be used. 
13.2 When surface finish, roughness, or texture is specified 
in a steel forging product standard, unless otherwise required 
by the purchaser, the roughness average (Ra), as defined in 
ANSI/ASME B46.1, shall be used (see 4.1.2). 
14. Inspection 
14.1 The manufacturer is responsible for the performance of 
all inspection and test requirements specified. The absence of 
any inspection requirements in the specification shall not 
relieve the contractor of the responsibility for ensuring that all 
products comply with all requirements of the contract. The 
manufacturer may use his own or any other suitable facilities 
for the performance of the inspection and test requirements 
unless disapproved by the purchaser at the time the order is 
placed. 
14.2 The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's inspector 
all reasonable facilities necessary to satisfy him that the 
material is being produced and furnished in accordance with 
the material specification.

15.1 shall be as agreed upon between manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
16. Certification 
16.1 The manufacturer shall furnish to the purchaser the 
number of copies of the material test report specified in the 
ordering information (4.1.4). The following items shall be 
reported: 
16.1.1 Purchase order number, 
16.1.2 Forging identification number, 
16.1.3 The product specification number, including the year 
date and revision letter if any, as well as the appropriate class, 
type, and grade, 
16.1.3.1 Reference to Specification A788/A788M including 
the year date together with the applicable revision letter, if any, 
of the revision used shall be a part of the certification. 
16.1.4 Heat number and analysis, 
16.1.5 Results of the required acceptance tests for mechani­
cal properties, 
16.1.6 Results of any required nondestructive examinations,

methods if required by the product specification or 4.2.3, 
16.1.8 Extent to which the forging is incomplete with 
respect to the product specification (see 1.4 and 16.1.7), and 
16.1.9 Results of any supplementary and additional test 
requirements that were specified. 
16.1.10 The material test report may be sent to the purchaser 
in electronic form from an electronic data interchange (EDI) 
transmission, and this shall be regarded as having the same 
validity as a counterpart printed in the certifier's facility. The 
content of the EDI transmitted document shall meet the 
requirements of the invokedASTM standard(s) and conform to 
any existing EDI agreement between the purchaser and the 
supplier. Notwithstanding the absence of a signature, the 
organization submitting the EDI transmission is responsible for 
the content of the report. 
17. Packaging and Package Marking 
17 .1 Each forging shall be legibly identified as required by 
the product specification and instructions from the purchaser. 
When not otherwise defined, each forging shall be identified by 
the manufacturer as follows: 
17 .1.1 Manufacturer's name or symbol. 
17 .1.2 Manufacturer's identification or heat number. 
17 .1.3 Product specification number. 
17 .1.4 The class, grade, and type identification as appropri-
ate. 
17.1.5 Purchaser's identification (4.2.3). 
17.1.6 Location of stamping (4.2.3). 
17.1.7 Incomplete forging (1.4). The marking shall include 
the suffix Y immediately following the ASTM number, and 
preceding any other suffix. This suffix shall not be removed 
until the material specification requirements have been com­
pleted and the material test report supplemented. 
17 .2 Marking shall be done by impression stamping or other 
acceptable means specified in the product specification or 
order. Bar coding is an acceptable supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. The bar coding system, if applied at 
the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one of 
published industry standards for bar coding. 
17.3 The specification year date, and revision letter are not 
required to be marked on the forgings.

A2. EXPLANATORY NOTE FOR WEIGHTED AVERAGE ANALYSIS 
A2.l A weighted average analysis is mandatory whenever 
an ingot is poured from the combination of two or more heats 
wherein the resultant chemistry of the ingot assumes an 
identity attributable to each heat involved in the combination. 
It is necessary to make this determination to ensure that each 
element in the official chemistry is represented by proportion to 
its amount in each individual furnace heat. An example of the 
determination of a weighted average analysis for an ingot made 
from a three-heat combination pour with varying weights and 
chemistry involved in each heat is shown below:

prescribed in Table 1. 
8. Product Analysis 
8.1 An analysis of either one billet or' one length of 
flat-rolled stock or one tube shall be made from each heat. The 
chemical composition thus determined shall conform to the 
requirements specified. 
8.2 A product analysis tolerance (see the annex table on 
Chemical Requirements (Product Analysis Tolerances) in 
Specification A480/A480M) shall apply. The product analysis 
tolerance is not applicable to the carbon content for material 
with a specified maximum carbon of 0.04 % or less. 
8.3 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional billets, lengths of flat-rolled stock, or tubes shall 
be made. Both retests for the elements in question shall meet 
the requirements of this specification; otherwise, all remaining 
material in the heat shall be rejected or, at the option of the 
producer, each billet or tube may be individually tested for 
acceptance. Billets, lengths of flat-rolled stock, or tubes that do 
not meet the requirements of this specification shall be re­
jected. 
NOTE 1-For flange and flaring requirements, the term lot applies to all 
tubes prior to cutting of the same nominal size and wall thickness that are 
produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a 
batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the same size 
and from the same heat that are heat treated in the same furnace charge. 
When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, or when heat 
treated condition is obtained directly by quenching after hot forming, the 
number of tubes of the same size and from the same heat in a lot shall be 
determined from the size of the tubes as prescribed in Table 3. 
NoTE 2-For tension and hardness test requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall 
thickness that are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
the same size and the same heat that are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, or when 
heat treated condition is obtained directly by quenching after hot forming, 
a lot shall include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the 
same furnace at the same temperature, time at heat, and furnace speed, or 
all tubes of the same size and heat, hot formed and quenched in the same 
production run. 
9. Mechanical Tests Required 
9.1 Tension Tests-One tension test shall be made on a 
specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall 
be made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes (see Note 2). 
9.2 Flaring Test (for Seamless Tubes)-One test shall be 
made on specimens from one end of one tube from each lot 
(see Note 1) of finished tubes. The minimum expansion of the 
inside diameter shall be 10 % .

12. Permissible Variations in Dimensions 
12.1 Variations in outside diameter, wall thickness, and 
length from those specified shall not exceed the amounts 
prescribed in Table 5. 
12.2 The permissible variations in outside diameter given in 
Table 5 are not sufficient to provide for ovality in thin-walled 
tubes, as defined in the table. In such tubes, the maximum and 
minimum diameters at any cross section shall deviate from the 
nominal diameter by no more than twice the permissible 
variation in outside diameter given in Table 5; however, the 
mean diameter at that cross section must still be within the 
given permissible variation. 
13. Surface Condition 
13.1 All tubes shall be free of excessive mill scale, suitable 
for inspection. A slight amount of oxidation will not be 
considered as scale. Any special finish requirements shall be 
subject to agreement between the manufacturer and the pur­
chaser. 
14. Product Marking 
14.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A1016/A1016M, the marking shall indicate whether the tubing 
is seamless or welded and the wall designation (average wall or

INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless and Welded Ferritic/Austenitic Stainless Steel 
Pipe 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A 790/ A 790M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon(,:) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1. 1 This specification 2 covers seamless and straight-seam 
welded ferritic/austenitic steel pipe intended for general corro­
sive service, with particular emphasis on resistance to stress 
corrosion cracking. These steels are susceptible to embrittle­
ment if used for prolonged periods at elevated temperatures. 
1.2 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for 
pipe when a greater degree of testing is desired. These 
supplementary requirements call for additional tests to be made 
and, when desired, one or more of these may be specified in the 
order. 
1.3 Appendix Xl of this specification lists the dimensions of 
welded and seamless stainless steel pipe as shown in ANSI 
B36.19. Pipe having other dimensions may be furnished 
provided such pipe complies with all other requirements of this 
specification. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the M 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
Norn 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as nominal 
diameter, size, and nominal size. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

ments selected. 
5. General Requirements 
5.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A999/ A999M unless otherwise provided herein. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 Manufacture: 
6.1.1 The pipe shall be made by the seamless or an 
automatic welding process, with no addition of filler metal in 
the welding operation. 
6.1.2 At the manufacturer's option, pipe may be either 
hot-finished or cold-finished. 
6.1.3 The pipe shall be pickled free of scale. When bright 
annealing is used, pickling is not necessary. 
6.2 Discard-A sufficient discard shall be made from each 
ingot to secure freedom from injurious piping and undue 
segregation. 
6.3 Unless otherwise stated in the order, all pipe shall be 
furnished in the heat-treated condition as shown in Table 1. 
6.3.1 For seamless pipe, as an alternate to final heat treat­
ment in a continuous furnace or batch-type furnace, immedi­
ately following hot forming while the temperature of the pipes 
is not less than the specified minimum solution treatment 
temperature, pipes shall be individually quenched in water or 
rapidly cooled by other means, except for UNS S32950, which 
shall be air cooled. 
6.3.2 If the purchaser desires pipe without heat treatment 
subsequent to welding, the purchase order shall specify the 
following condition: 
6.3.2.1 No final heat treatment of pipe fabricated from plate 
that has been heat treated as required by Table 1 for the 
particular grade is required, provided a sample of that heat of 
finished pipe or material representative of that heat of pipe as 
a prolongation of the weld passes the Test Methods A923 
Method B or C (See Note 2), including base metal, weld metal, 
and heat affected zone per heat. Each pipe supplied under this 
requirement shall be stenciled with the suffix "HT-O." 
6.3.2.2 For materials not listed in Table 3 of Test Methods 
A923, the HT-O provision does not apply. 
NoTE 2-The Test Methods A923 test method (B or C) is at the 
manufacturer's option, unless otherwise specified by the purchaser. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements as 
prescribed in Table 2. 
8. Heat Analysis 
8.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the 
steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of the ele­
ments specified. 
9. Product Analysis 
9.1 At the request of the purchaser's inspector, an analysis 
of one billet or one length of flat-rolled stock from each heat, 
or two pipes from each lot, shall be made by the manufacturer. 
A lot of pipe shall consist of the following number of lengths 
of the same size and wall thickness from any one heat of steel: 
NPS Designator 
Under 2 
2 to 5, incl 
6 and over 
Lengths of Pipe in Lot 
400 or fraction thereof 
200 or fraction thereof 
1 00 or fraction thereof 
9.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the 
purchaser or the purchaser's representative and shall conform 
to the requirements specified in Section 7. 
9.3 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 8.1 or 9.1 
does not conform to the requirements specified in Section 7, an 
analysis of each billet or pipe from the same heat or lot may be 
made, and all billets or pipe conforming to the requirements 
shall be accepted. 
10. Tensile and Hardness Properties 
10.1 The material shall conform to the tensile and hardness 
properties prescribed in Table 3. 
11. Lengths 
11.1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following 
regular practice: 
11.1.1 Unless otherwise agreed upon, all sizes from NPS 1/s 
to and including NPS 8 are available in a length up to 24 ft (see 
Note 3) with the permissible range of 15 to 24 ft (see Note 3). 
Short lengths are acceptable and the number and minimum 
length shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
NoTE 3-This value applies when the inch-pound designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase. When the M designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase, the corresponding metric value( s) 
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
11.1.2 If definite cut lengths are desired, the lengths re­
quired shall be specified in the order. No pipe shall be less than 
the specified length and no more than ¼ in. [6 mm] over it. 
11.1.3 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise specified. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The finished pipes shall be reasonably straight and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. Imperfections may be re­
moved by grinding, provided the wall thicknesses are not 
decreased to less than that permitted, in the Permissible 
Variations in Wall Thickness Section of Specification A999/ 
A999M. 
13. Mechanical Tests Required 
13.1 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One tension 
test shall be made on a specimen for lots of not more than 100

13.3 Flattening Test-For pipe heat treated in a batch-type 
furnace, :flattening tests shall be made on 5 % of the pipe from 
each heat-treated lot. For pipe heat treated by the continuous 
process, or by direct quenching after hot forming, this test shall 
be made on a sufficient number of pipes to constitute 5 % of the 
lot, but in no case less than two lengths of pipe. 
13.3.1 For welded pipe, a transverse guided face bend test 
of the weld may be conducted instead of a :flattening test in 
accordance with the method outlined in the steel tubular 
product supplement of Test Methods and Definitions A370. For 
welded pipe with a specified wall thickness 2: 3/s in. [9.52 mm], 
two side bend tests may be made instead of the face bend test. 
The ductility of the weld shall be considered acceptable when 
there is no evidence of cracks in the weld or between the weld 
and the base metal after bending. Test specimens from 5 % of 
the lot shall be taken from the pipes or test plates of the same 
material as the pipe, the test plates being attached to the end of 
the cylinder and welded as a prolongation of the pipe longitu­
dinal seam. 
13.4 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two pipes from each lot (see 
13.2). 
14. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
14.1 Each pipe shall be subjected to the nondestructive 
electric test or the hydrostatic test. The type of test to be used 
shall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order. 
14.2 The hydrostatic test shall be in accordance with Speci­
fication A999/A999M, except that the value for S to be used in 
the calculation of the hydrostatic test pressure shall be equal to 
50 % of the specified minimum yield strength of the pipe. 
14.3 Nondestructive Electric Test-Nondestructive electric 
tests shall be in accordance with Practices E213 or E309. 
14.3.1 As an alternative to the hydrostatic test, and when 
specified by the purchaser, each pipe shall be examined with a 
nondestructive test in accordance with Practices E213 or E309. 
Unless specifically called out by the purchaser, the selection of 
the nondestructive electric test will be at the option of the 
manufacturer. The range of pipe sizes that may be examined by 
each method shall be subject to the limitations in the scope of 
the respective practices. 
14.3.1.1 The following information is for the benefit of the 
user of this specification: 
14.3.1.2 The reference standards defined in 14.3.1.3 -
14.3 .1.5 are convenient standards for calibration of nondestruc­
tive testing equipment. The dimensions of these standards 
should not be construed as the minimum size imperfection 
detectable by such equipment. 
14.3.1.3 The ultrasonic testing (UT) can be performed to 
detect both longitudinally and circumferentially oriented de­
fects. It should be recognized that different techniques should 
be employed to detect differently oriented imperfections. The 
examination may not detect short, deep, defects. 
14.3.1.4 The eddy-current testing (ET) referenced in this 
specification (see Practice E426) has the capability of detecting 
significant discontinuities, especially the short abrupt type. 
14.3 .1.5 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
14.4 Time of Examination-Nondestructive testing for 
specification acceptance shall be performed after all mechani­
cal processing, heat treatments, and straightening operations. 
This requirement does not preclude additional testing at earlier 
stages in the processing. 
14.5 Surface Condition: 
14.5.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, paint, 
or other foreign material that could interfere with interpretation 
of test results. The methods used for cleaning and preparing the 
surfaces for examination shall not be detrimental to the base 
metal or the surface finish. 
14.5.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can 
produce signals that interfere with the test. 
14.6 Extent of Examination: 
14.6.1 The relative motion of the pipe and the transducer(s), 
coil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire pipe surface is 
scanned, except as in 14.6.2. 
14.6.2 The existence of end effects is recognized and the 
extent of such effects shall be determined by the manufacturer 
and, if requested, shall be reported to the purchaser. Other 
nondestructive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
14.7 Operator Qualifications-The test unit operator shall 
be certified in accordance with SNT-TC- lA, or an equivalent 
recognized and documented standard. 
14.8 Test Conditions: 
14.8.1 For eddy-current testing, the excitation coil fre­
quency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration yet 
provide good signal-to-noise ratio. 
14.8.2 The maximum eddy-current coil frequency used 
shall be as follows: 
On specified walls up to 0.050 in.-100 KHz max 
On specified walls up to 0.150 in.-50 KHz max 
On specified walls over 0.150 in.-10 KHz max 
14.8.3 Ultrasonic-For examination by the ultrasonic 
method, the minimum nominal transducer frequency shall be 
2.00 MHz and the maximum nominal transducer size shall be 
1.5 in. If the equipment contains a reject notice filter setting, 
this shall remain off during calibration and testing unless 
linearity can be demonstrated at that setting. 
14.9 Reference Standards-Reference standards of conve­
nient length shall be prepared from a length of pipe of the same 
grade, size (NPS, or outside diameter and schedule or wall 
thickness), surface finish and heat treatment condition as the 
pipe to be examined. 
14.9.1 For Ultrasonic Testing, the reference ID and OD 
notches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes 
shown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The 
depth of each notch shall not exceed 12 ½ % of the specified 
nominal wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in., whichever is 
1299

=== Page 1362 ===

SA-790/SA-790M (ASTM A790/A790M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
greater. The width of the notch shall not exceed twice the 
depth. Notches shall be placed on both the OD and ID surfaces. 
14.9.2 For Eddy-Current Testing, the reference standard 
shall contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following discontinuities: 
14.9.2.1 Drilled Hole-The reference standard shall contain 
three or more holes equally spaced circumferentially around 
the pipe and longitudinally separated by a sufficient distance to 
allow distinct identification of the signal from each hole. The 
holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the pipe 
wall, with care being taken to avoid distortion of the pipe while 
drilling. One hole shall be drilled in the weld, if visible. 
Alternately, the producer of welded pipe may choose to drill 
one hole in the weld and run the calibration standard through 
the test coils three times with the weld turned at 120° on each 
pass. The hole diameter shall vary with NPS as follows: 
NPS Designator Hole Diameter 
0.039 in. [1 mm] 
above ½ to 1 ¼ 0.055 in. [1.4 mm] 
above 1 ¼ to 2 0.071 in. [1.8 mm] 
above 2 to 5 0.087 In. [2.2 mm] 
above 5 0.106 in. [2.7 mm] 
14.9.2.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool 
or file with a ¼-in. [6.4-mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe. Said notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12 ½ % of the specified nominal wall thickness of 
the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.102 mm], whichever is greater. 
14.9.2.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. or less in 
width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the tube 
axis on the outside surface of the pipe to have a depth not 
exceeding 12 ½ % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.004 in., whichever is greater. The length of the notch shall be 
compatible with the testing method. 
More or smaller reference discontinuities, or both, may be 
used by agreement between the purchaser and the manufac­
turer. 
14.10 Standardization Procedure: 
14.10.1 The test apparatus shall be standardized at the 
beginning and end of each series of pipes of the same size 
(NPS or diameter and schedule or wall thickness, grade, and 
heat treatment condition), and at intervals not exceeding 4 h. 
More frequent standardization may be performed at the manu­
facturer's option or may be required upon agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
14.10.2 The test apparatus shall also be standardized after 
any change in test system settings, change of operator, equip­
ment repair, or interruption due to power loss, process shut­
down, or when a problem is suspected. 
14.10.3 The reference standard shall be passed through the 
test apparatus at the same speed and test system settings as the 
pipe to be tested. 
14.10.4 The signal-to-noise ratio for the reference standard 
shall be 2 ½ to 1 or greater. Extraneous signals caused by 
identifiable causes such as dings, scratches, dents, straightener 
marks, and so forth shall not be considered noise. The rejection 
amplitude shall be adjusted to be at least 50 % of full scale of 
the readout display. 
14.10.5 If upon any standardization, the rejection amplitude 
has decreased by 29 % (3 dB) of peak height from the last 
standardization, the pipe since the last calibration shall be 
rejected. The test system settings may be changed or the 
transducer(s), coil(s), or sensor(s) adjusted and the unit restan­
dardized. But all pipe tested since the last acceptable standard­
ization must be retested for acceptance. 
14.11 Evaluation of Impeifections: 
14.11.1 Pipes producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
lowest signal produced by the reference standard(s) shall be 
identified and separated from the acceptable pipes. The area 
producing the signal may be reexamined. 
14.11.2 Such pipes shall be rejected if the test signal was 
produced by imperfections that cannot be identified or was 
produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. These pipes 
may be repaired per Sections 12 and 13. To be accepted, a 
repaired pipe must pass the same non-destructive test by which 
it was rejected, and it must meet the minimum wall thickness 
requirements of this specification. 
14.11.3 If the test signals were produced by visual imper­
fections such as: (1) scratches, (2) surface roughness, (3) dings, 
(4) straightener marks, (5) cutting chips, (6) steel die stamps, 
(7) stop marks, or (8) pipe reducer ripple. The pipe may be 
accepted based on visual examination, provided the imperfec­
tion is less than 0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 12 ½%of the specified 
wall thickness (whichever is greater). 
14.11.4 Rejected pipe may be reconditioned and retested 
providing the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that 
required by this or the product specification. The outside 
diameter at the point of grinding may be reduced by the amount 
so removed. To be accepted, retested pipe shall meet the test 
requirement. 
14.11.5 If the imperfection is explored to the extent that it 
can be identified as non-rejectable, the pipe may be accepted 
without further test providing the imperfection does not en­
croach on the minimum wall thickness. 
15. Repair by Welding 
15.1 For welded pipe of size NPS 6 or larger with a 
specified wall thickness of 0.188 in. [4.8 mm] or more, weld 
repairs made with the addition of compatible filler metal may 
be made to the weld seam with the same procedures specified 
for plate defects in the section on Repair by Welding of 
Specification A999/ A999M. 
15.2 Weld repairs of the weld seam shall not exceed 20 % of 
the seam length. 
15.3 Except as allowed by 15.3.1, weld repairs shall be 
made only with the gas tungsten-arc welding process using the 
same classification of bare filter rod qualified to the most 
current AWS Specification A5.9 as the grade of pipe being 
repaired as given in Table 4. 
15.3.1 Subject to approval by the purchaser, it shall be 
permissible for weld repairs to be made with the gas tungsten­
arc welding process using a filler metal more highly alloyed 
than the base metal, if needed for corrosion resistance or other 
properties.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
FOR PIPE REQUIRING SPECIAL CONSIDERATION 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the 
purchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided 
in the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, 
retest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. 
Sl. Product Analysis 
S 1.1 For all pipe over NPS 5 there shall be one product 
analysis made of a representative sample from one piece for 
each ten lengths or fraction thereof from each heat of steel. 
S 1.2 For pipe smaller than NPS 5 there shall be one product 
analysis made from ten lengths per heat of steel or from 10 % 
of the number of lengths per heat of steel, whichever number 
is smaller. 
S 1.3 Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical 
requirements specified in Section 7 shall be rejected. 
S2. Transverse Tension Tests 
S2.1 There shall be one transverse tension test made from 
one end of 10 % of the lengths furnished per heat of steel. This 
applies only to pipe over NPS 8. 
S2.2 If a specimen from any length fails to conform to the 
tensile properties specified that length shall be rejected. 
S3. Flattening Test 
S3.1 The flattening test of Specification A999/A999M shall 
be made on a specimen from one end or both ends of each pipe. 
Crops ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is 
specified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. 
If a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility 
prior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening 
test requirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat­
ment in accordance with Specification A999/ A999M and 
satisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails 
because of a lack of soundness that length shall be rejected, 
unless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length 
is sound. 
S4. Etching Tests 
S4.1 The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching 
tests conducted in accordance with the appropriate portions of 
Method E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section 
from one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound 
and reasonably uniform material free of injurious laminations, 
cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this supplementary 
requirement is specified, the number of tests per pipe required 
shall also be specified. If a specimen from any length shows 
objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, subject to 
removal of the defective end and subsequent retests indicating 
the remainder of the length to be sound and reasonably uniform 
material.

A For small diameter or thin walls, or both, tubing, where many drawing passes are required, a carbon maximum of 0.015 % is necessary. Small outside diameter tubes 
are defined as those less than 0.500 in. [12. 7 mm] in outside diameter and light wall tubes as those less than 0.049 in. [1.2 mm] in average wall thickness (0.040 in. [1 
mm] in minimum wall thickness). 
8 Nickel + copper. 
c Carbon + nitrogen = 0.025 max. 
°The term Niobium (Nb) and Columbium (Cb) are alternate names for the same element. 
sulfur may be detrimental to stainless steels. The manufacturer 
shall employ techniques which minimize surface contamina­
tion by these elements. 
7. Cleaning Before Annealing 
7 .1 All lubricants or coatings used in the manufacture of 
straight-length tube or in the bending shall be removed from all 
surfaces prior to any annealing treatments. U-bends on which 
a lubricant had been applied to the inside surface during 
bending shall have the cleanness of their inside surface 
confirmed by blowing close-fitting acetone-soaked felt plugs 
through 10 % of the tubes of each bend radius. Dry, oil-free air 
or inert gas shall be used to blow the plugs through the tubes. 
If the plugs blown through any tube show more than a light 
gray discoloration, all tubes that have had a lubricant applied to 
the inside surface during bending shall be recleaned. After 
recleaning 10 % of the tubes of each bend radius whose inside 
surface had been subjected to bending, lubricants shall be 
retested. 
8. Heat Treatment 
8.1 All finished straight tubing or straight tubing ready for 
U-bending shall be furnished in the solution-annealed condi­
tion. The annealing procedure shall consist of heating the 
material to a temperature of 1200°F [650°C] or higher and 
cooling (as appropriate for the grade) to meet the requirements 
of this specification. 
8.2 If heat treatment of U-bends is specified, it shall satisfy 
the annealing procedure described in 8.1 and shall be done as 
follows: 
8.2.1 The heat treatment shall be applied to the U-bend area 
plus approximately 6 in. [150 mm] of each leg beyond the 
tangent point of the U-bend. 
8.2.2 If the heat treatment specified in 8.2 is accomplished 
by resistance-heating methods wherein electrodes are clamped 
to the tubes, the clamped areas shall be visually examined for 
arc burns. Burn indications shall be cause for rejection unless 
they can be removed by local polishing without encroaching 
upon minimum wall thickness. 
8.2.3 Temperature control shall be accomplished through 
the use of optical or emission pyrometers, or both. No 
temperature-indicating crayons, lacquers, or pellets shall be 
used. 
8.2.4 The inside of the tube shall be purged with a protective 
or an inert gas atmosphere during heating and cooling to below 
700°F [370°C] to prevent scaling of the inside surface. The 
atmosphere should be noncarburizing. 
9. Chemical Composition 
9.1 Product Analysis: 
9 .1.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical composition 
in Table l. 
9.1.2 When specified on the purchase order, a product 
analysis shall be supplied from one tube or coil of steel per 
heat. The product analysis tolerance of Specification A480/ 
A480M shall apply. 
9.1.3 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be 
made. Both retests, for the elements in question, shall meet the 
requirements of this specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot shall be rejected or, at the option of 
1307

=== Page 1370 ===

SA-803/SA-803M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or tube may be 
individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat-rolled stock 
or tubes that do not meet the requirements of this specification 
shall be rejected. 
10. Mechanical Requirements 
10.1 Tensile Properties: 
10.1.1 The material shall conform to the tensile properties 
shown in Table 2. 
10.1.2 One tension test shall be made on a specimen for lots 
of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall be made on 
specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 tubes. 
10.1.3 Table 3 gives the computed minimum elongation 
values for each 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] decrease in wall thickness. 
10.2 Hardness: 
10 .2.1 The tubes shall have a hardness number not to exceed 
those prescribed in Table 4. This hardness requirement is not to 
apply to the bend area of U-bend tubes which are not heat 
treated after bending. 
10.2.2 Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests shall be made on 
specimens from two tubes from each lot. 
10.3 Reverse Flattening Test (for Welded Product)-One 
reverse flattening test shall be made on a specimen from each 
1500 ft [460 m] of finished tubing. 
10.4 Flange Test (for Welded Product)-Flange tests shall 
be made on specimens from each end of one finished tube, not 
the one used for the flattening test, from each lot. 
10.5 Flaring Test (for Seamless Tubes)-One test shall be 
made on specimens from one end of one tube from each lot of 
finished tubes. The minimum expansion of the inside diameter 
shall be 10 % . 
10.6 Pressure Test-Each straight tube, or each U-tube after 
completion of the bending and post-bending heat treatment, 
shall be pressure-tested in accordance with one of the follow­
ing paragraphs as specified by the purchaser: 
10.6.1 Hydrostatic Test-Each tube shall be given an inter­
nal hydrostatic test in accordance with Specification Al016/ 
Al016M.

10.6.2 Pneumatic Test-Each tube shall be examined by a 
pneumatic test (either air underwater or pneumatic leak test) in 
accordance with Specification Al016/A1016M. 
10.7 Lot Definitions: 
10.7.1 For flange and flaring test requirements, the term 
"lot" applies to 125 tube groupings, prior to cutting to length, 
of the same nominal size and wall thickness, produced from the 
same heat of steel and annealed in a continuous furnace. 
10. 7 .2 For tension and hardness requirements, the term "lot" 
applies to all tubes, prior to cutting to length, of the same 
nominal diameter and wall thickness, produced from the same 
heat of steel and annealed in a continuous furnace at the same 
temperature, time at temperature, and furnace speed. 
11. Corrosion Resisting Properties 
11.1 One full section sample 1 in. [25 mm] long from the 
center of a sample tube of the smallest radius bend that is heat 
1308

=== Page 1371 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-803 /SA-803M 
treated shall be tested in the heat treated condition in accor­
dance with the appropriate practice in Practices A 763 for the 
specified grade, or as agreed upon for TP409. 
11.2 One full-section sample l in. [25 mm] long from each 
lot of straight tubes shall be tested in the finished condition in 
accordance with the appropriate practice in Practices A 763 for 
the specified grade, or as agreed upon for TP409. 
11.3 The appearance of any fissures or cracks in the test 
specimen, when evaluated in accordance with the Evaluation 
Sections of Practices A 763 indicating the presence of inter­
granular attack, shall be cause for rejection of that lot. 
11.4 For corrosion test requirements, the term "lot" applies 
to all tubes, p1ior to cutting to length, of the same nominal 
diameter and wall thickness, produced from the same heat of 
steel and annealed in a continuous furnace at the same 
temperature, time at temperature, and furnace speed. 
12. Permissible Variations in Dimensions (Fig. I) 
12.1 Permissible variations from the specified outside diam­
eter shall be in accordance with Specification A1016/A1016M. 
Those tolerances do not apply to the bent portion of the

wall thickness shall not exceed +20 - 0 %. 
12.2.2 Permissible variations from the specified average 
wall thickness are ± 10 % of the nominal wall thickness. 
12.2.3 The wall thickness of the tube in the U-bent section 
shall not be less than value determined by the equation: 
4RT 
t1= 4R+D 
where: 
fr = wall thickness after bending, in. [mm], 
T = specified minimum tube wall thickness, in. [mm], 
R = centerline bend radius, in. [mm], and 
D = nominal outside tube diameter, in. [mm]. 
12.3 Permissible Variations from the Specified Length: 
12.3.1 Straight Lengths-The maximum permissible varia­
tions for lengths 24 ft [7.3 m] and shorter shall be + 1/s in. [+3 
mm], -0; for lengths longer than 24 ft [7.3 m], an additional 
over tolerance of +\Is in. [+3 mm] for each 10 ft [3 m], or 
fraction thereof, shall be permitted up to a maximum of +\/2 in. 
[+13 mm]. 
12.3.2 U-Bends-In the case of U-tubes, the length of the 
tube legs, as measured from the point of tangency of the bend 
and the tube leg to the end of the tube leg, shall not be less than 
specified, but may exceed the specified values by the amount 
given in Table 5. The difference in lengths of the tube legs shall 
not be greater than 1/s in. [3 mm] unless otherwise specified. 
12.4 The end of any tube may depart from square by not 
more than the amount given in Table 6. 
12.5 The leg spacing measured between the points of 
tangency of the bend to the legs shall not vary from the value

12.6 The bent portion of the U-tube shall be substantially 
uniform in curvature, and not to exceed ± 1/1.6 in. [ ±: 1.5 mm] of 
the nominal center-line radius. 
12.7 Permissible deviation from the plane of bend (see Fig. 
1) shall not exceed \/16 in. [1.5 mm] as measured from the 
points of tangency. 
13. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
13 .1 Tubing purchased to this specification is intended for 
use in heat exchangers and will be inse1ted through close­
fitting holes in baffles or support plates, or both, spaced along 
the tube length. The tube ends will also be inserted into very 
close-fitting holes in a tubesheet and expanded and may be 
welded therein. The tubes shall be able to stand roll expanding 
(See Footnote 1) and bending without showing cracks and flaws, 
and shall be finished reasonably straight and suitable for the

intended purpose. Surface defects that violate minimum wall 
requirements shall be cause for rejection. 
NoIB 1-Ferritic stainless steels may be expanded by other methods but 
the user should exercise precautions when using methods other than roll 
expansion as these grades have a higher ductile-brittle transition 
temperature, are more strain rate sensitive, and have lower ductility than 
austenitic grades. 
13.2 The residual chloride salt contamination of the inside 
and outside surface of the tubing at the time of packing for 
shipment from the mill shall not exceed a concentration of l 
mg/ft 2 [10.7 mg/m 2 ] of tube surface. One tube in each 500 
pieces shall be checked immediately prior to packing for 
shipment for chloride salt contamination by a procedure agreed 
to between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
14. Surface Condition 
14.1 The straight tubes, after final annealing, shall be 
pickled using a solution of nitric and hydrofluoric acids 
followed by flushing and rinsing in water. If bright-annealing is 
performed, this requirement does not apply. 
14.1.1 All tubes shall be free of excessive mill scale, 
suitable for inspection. A slight amount of oxidation will not be 
considered as scale. Any special finish requirements shall be 
subject to agreement between the manufacturer and the pur­
chaser. 
14.2 A light oxide scale on the outside surface of U-bend 
area shall be pennitted for tubes that have been electric­
resistan.ce heat treated after bending. 
15. Nondestructive Test (Electric Test) 
15.1 Each straight tube shall be tested after the finish heat 
treatment by passing it through a nondestructive tester capable 
of detecting defects on the entire cross section of the tube in 
accordance with Specification A1016/A1016M. 
16. Inspection 
16.l The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry, at all times, to those areas where inspection and testing 
is being performed on the purchaser's ordered material. The 
manufacturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities 
to satisfy the inspector that the material is being furnished in 
accordance with this specification. All required tests and 
inspections shall be made at the place of manufacture prior to 
shipment, unless otherwise specified, and shall be conducted so 
as not to interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the 
works. 
17. Rejection 
17 .1 Each length of tubing received from the manufacturer 
may be inspected by the purchaser, and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of the specification based on the inspection and 
test method outlined in the specification, the tubing may be 
rejected and the manufacturer shall be notified. Disposition of 
rejected tubing shall be a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
17 .2 Material that fails in any of the fanning operations or 
in the process of installation and is found to be defective, shall 
be set aside, and the manufacturer shall be notified. Disposition 
of such material shall be a matter for agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
18. Certification 
18.1 A test report, signed by an authorized employee or 
representative of the manufacturer, shall be furnished to the 
purchaser to indicate the specification and grade, seamless or 
welded, the results of the heat analysis, hardness, and tensile 
properties. Product analysis will be repmted only when re­
quested on the purchase order as provided in 9 .1.1. 
19. Product Marking 
19 .1 All tubes shall be marked with the heat number. 
19.2 Containers and packages shall be marked or tagged to 
show the purchaser's order number, the manufacturer's order 
number, specification, seamless or welded, grade, size and wall 
thickness, minimum or average, number of pieces contained in 
the package, and item number (if appropriate). 
20. Packaging 
20.1 All tubing shall be packaged and blocked in such a 
manner as to prevent damage in ordinary handling and trans­
portation. The boxes shall be constructed in such a manner that 
no nails, staples, screws, or similar fasteners are required to 
close and secure the box after the tubes have been placed in the 
box. The box shall be lined with plastic sheet or vapor barrier 
materials so as to prevent chloride contamination of the tube 
during handling, transportation, and storage. 
20.2 The U-bent tubes shall be arranged in boxes so that the 
smaller radius bends may be removed without disturbing larger 
radius bends. Tubes for an item number shall be boxed 
together.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements may become a part of the specification when specified 
in the inquiry or invitation to bid and pm-chase order or contract. These requirements shall not be 
considered, unless specified in the order, in which event the necessary tests shall be made by the 
manufacturer prior to the bending or shipment of the tubing. 
Sl. Nondestructive Eddy-Current Test 
S 1.1 Each tube in the finished condition, except for bending 
if that is required, shall be tested by passing it through an 
electric nondestrnctive tester capable of detecting defects on 
the entire cross section of the tube. Suitable instrumentation 
shall be used to clearly distinguish the artificial defects. The 
outside and inside surfaces of the tubes shall be free of loose 
scale, metallic particles, or other material that would tend to 
restrict signals or create electrical noise. The tubing shall be 
inspected by feeding it longitudinally through an inspection 
coil or coils with a diameter suitable for the diameter of tubing 
to be inspected. The instrument calibration shall be accom­
plished with a reference standard prepared from the approp1iate 
length of selected tubing of the same size, grade, and physical 
condition as the material to be inspected. The standard shall be 
fed through the coil at the same speed that the inspection of the 
tubing is performed. 
Sl.2 The factors listed in S1.3 shall be selected or adjusted, 
or both, in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's 
instrnctions, for the particular instrument involved as required 
to achieve optimum instrument distinction between the refer­
ence defects and plain portions of the tube. 
S 1.3 The following as well as other factors involved shall 
not be used in such a manner that they detract from the overall 
ability of the instrument to detect defects: test frequency, 
direct-cmTent saturation level, filter networks, phase-analysis 
circuits, coil diameter, and instrument gain. 
Sl.4 The reference standard shall consist of a defect-free 
sample of the same size, alloy, and condition (temper) as that 
being tested, and shall contain longitudinal and circumferential 
notches on the outside diameter establishing the rejection level 
of the tubing to be tested. Inside diameter notches, both 
longitudinal and transverse, shall also be a part of the reference 
standard. These inside notches may be larger than the outside 
notches, and are intended for use only to assure instrument 
phase settings capable of yielding optimum inside surface 
sensitivity. 
S 1.4.1 All notches shall be produced by EDM methods. The 
outside diameter notches shall be of the dimensions shown in 
Table S 1.1. See also Fig. S LI. 
S 1.5 All tubing shall meet this specification. The instrument 
calibration shall be verified at the start of testing, after any shut 
down of the test equipment, after any test equipment 
adjustment, or at least every V2 h of continuous production 
testing, or both. Tubes generating a signal above the outside­
diameter calibration standard sensitivity level shall be rejected. 
S 1.6 Tubes may be reconditioned and retested provided 
reconditioning does not adversely effect the minimum wall 
thickness or other properties of the tube specification require-

Resolved Notes (AI-verified)
NOTE 2 (page 1349)
NoTE 2-For tension and hardness test requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall 
thickness that are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
the same size and the same heat that are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, or when 
heat treated condition is obtained directly by quenching after hot forming, 
a lot shall include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the 
same furnace at the same temperature, time at heat, and furnace speed, or 
all tubes of the same size and heat, hot formed and quenched in the same 
production run. 
9. Mechanical Tests Required 
9.1 Tension Tests-One tension test shall be made on a 
specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall 
be made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes (see Note 2). 
9.2 Flaring Test (for Seamless Tubes)-One test shall be 
made on specimens from one end of one tube from each lot 
(see Note 1) of finished tubes. The minimum expansion of the 
inside diameter shall be 10 % .
