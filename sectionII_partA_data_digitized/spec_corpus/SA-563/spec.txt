SA-563 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR CARBON AND ALLOY 
STEEL NUTS 
SA-563 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 563-07a(2014) except for deletion of the term "private label distributor" in para. 14.7 and 14.9 and 
editorially correct title.] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers chemical and mechanical 
requirements for eight grades of carbon and alloy steel 
nuts for general structural and mechanical uses on bolts, 
studs, and other externally threaded parts. 
NOTE 1 - See Appendix Xl for guidance on suitable application of 
nut grades. 
1.2 The requirements for any grade of nut may, at the 
supplier's option, and with notice to the purchaser, be 
fulfilled by furnishing nuts of one of the stronger grades 
specified herein unless such substitution is barred in the 
inquiry and purchase order. 
1.3 Grades C3 and DH3 nuts have atmospheric corro­
sion resistance and weathering characteristics comparable 
to that of the steels covered in Specifications 
A 242/ A 242M, A 588/ A 588M, and A 709 / A 709M. The 
atmospheric corrosion resistance of these steels is substan­
tially better than that of carbon steel with or without copper 
addition (see 5.2). When properly exposed to the atmo­
sphere, these steels can be used bare (uncoated) for many 
applications. 
NOTE 2 - A complete metric compan.ion to Specification A 563 has 
_ -bet\n. dev€\lo13ed-A 563M; therefore, no metric equIValenfs are presentea 
in this specification. 
1.4 Terms used in this specification are defined in Ter­
minology F 1789 unless otherwise defined herein.

NOTES: 
(Al To determine nut proof load in pounds, multiply the appropriate nut proof load stress by the tensile stress area of the thread. Stress areas 
for U NC, UN F, and 8 UN thread series are given in Table 4. 
(8) Non-zinc-coated nuts are nuts intended for use with externally threaded fasteners which have a plain (nonplated or noncoatedl finish or have 
a plating or coating of insufficient thickness to necessitate overtapping the nut thread to provide assemblability. Zinc-coated nuts are nuts 
intended for use with externally threaded fasteners which are hot-dip zinc-coated, mechanically zinc-coated, or have a plating or coating of 
sufficient thickness to necessitate overtapping the nut thread to provide assemblability. 
(Cl Nuts made in accordance to the requirements of Specification A 194/A 194M, Grade 2 or Grade 2H, and marked with their grade symbol 
are acceptable equivalents for Grades C and D nuts. When A 194 zinc-coated inch series nuts are supplied, the zinc coating, overtapping, 
lubrication and rotational capacity testing shall be in accordance with Specification A 563. 
(D) Nuts made in accordance with the requirements of Specification A 194/A 194M, Grade 2H, and marked with its grade symbol are an acceptable 
equivalent for Grade DH nuts. When A 194 zinc-coated inch series nuts are supplied, the zinc coating, overtapping, lubrication and rotational 
capacity testing shall be in accordance with Specification A 563. '~

(Al The availability of DH nuts in nominal sizes¾ in. and larger is very limited and generally available only on special orders for 50 000 pieces 
or more. For smaller quantities A 194 Gr. 2H nuts should be considered. 
(BJ "Recommended" denotes a commercially available nut having the most suitable mechanical properties and dimensional configuration (style) 
that will make it possible to torque the bolt to the required load when used in combination with the nut. 
(Cl "Suitable" denotes nuts having mechanical properties that will make it possible to torque the bolt to the required load when used in combination 
with the nut; but, which require consideration of dimensional configuration (style) suitability and availability. Others are not suitable. 
(DJ The term "bolt" includes all externally threaded types of fasteners. 
(El Non-zinc-coated nuts are nuts intended for use with externally threaded fasteners which have a plain (nonplated or noncoated) finish or have 
a plating or coating of insufficient thickness to necessitate overlapping the nut thread to provide assemblability. Zinc-coated nuts are nuts 
intended for use with externally threaded fasteners which are hot-dip zinc-coated, mechanically zinc-coated, or have a plating or coating of 
sufficient thickness to necessitate overlapping the nut thread to provide assemblability.

1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers bars and shapes of age­
hardening stainless steels. Hot-finished or cold-finished 
rounds, squares, hexagons, bar shapes, angles, tees, and 
channels are included; these shapes may be produced by 
hot rolling, extruding, or forging. Billets or bars for reforg­
ing may be purchased to this specification. 
1.2 These steels are generally used for parts requiring 
corrosion resistance and high strength at room temperature, 
or at temperatures up to 600°F [315°C]; 700°F (370°C] 
for Type 632; 840°F [450°C] for Type UNS S46910. They 
are suitable for machining in the solution-annealed condi­
tion after which they may be age-hardened to the mechani­
cal properties specified in Section 7 without danger of 
cracking or distortion. Type XM-25 is machinable in the 
as-received fully heat treated condition. Type UNS S46910 
is suitable for machining in the solution-annealed, cold­
worked, and aged-hardened condition.

8 Time refers to minimum time material is at temperature and may be extended to obtain required ductility properties. 
c Unless otherwise noted, temperatures shown are suggested temperatures and may be varied to obtain required tensile properties. 
0 Intermediate temperatures must meet the ductility requirements of the next highest suggested hardening or aging temperature, or both. 
Example: Type 630 at 1050°F [565°CJ must have 13% elongation and 45% reduction, same as for age hardening at 1075°F [580°CJ. 
E CU - Longitudinal axis of specimen parallel to direction of grain flow during rolling or forging. CT) - Transverse axis of specimen per-
pendicular to direction of grain flow during rolling or forging. 
F See 7.3. 
G Either Rockwell C hardness or Brinell is permissible. On sizes½ in. (12.70 mm) and smaller, Rockwell C is preferred. 
H When air cooling is specified, gases other than air may be used.

INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Steel, Sheet, Carbon, Structural, and High-Strength, Low­
Alloy, Hot-Rolled and Cold-Rolled, General Requirements 
for 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A568/A568M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department qf Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification covers the general requirements for 
steel sheet in coils and cut lengths. It applies to the following 
specifications that describe carbon steel, structural steel, and 
high-strength, low-alloy steel (HSLA) furnished as hot-rolled 
sheet and cold-rolled sheet: Specifications A414/A414M, 
A424/A424M, A606/A606M, A659/A659M, A794/A794M, 
A1008/A1008M, AlOll/AlOllM, and Al039/A1039M. 
1.2 This specification is not applicable to hot-rolled heavy­
thickness carbon sheet coils (Specification A635/A635M). 
1.3 In case of any conflict in requirements, the requirements 
of the individual material specification shall prevail over those 
of this general specification. 
1.4 For the purposes of determining conformance with this 
and the appropriate product specification referenced in 1. 1, 
measured values, calculated values, or observed values shall be 
rounded to the nearest unit in the right hand place of figures 
used in expressing the limiting values in accordance with the 
rounding method of Practice E29. 
1.4. l Ordered values, identified in tables, specified such as 
over 30 through 48 or 30 exclusive to 48 inclusive, covers all 
ordered values specified as 30.1, 30.01, 30.001, etc., up to and 
including 48.000 etc., but does not cover ordered values 
specified as3U.O00 etc., or less, nor does it cover ordered 
values specified as 48.1, 48.01, 48.001, etc. 
1.5 Annex Al lists permissible variations in dimensions and 
mass (see Note 1) in SI [metric] units. The values listed are not 
exact conversions of the values listed in the inch-pound tables, 
but instead are rounded or rationalized values. Conformance to 
Annex Al is mandatory when the "M" specification is used. 
NoTE 1-The term weight is used when inch-pound units are the

standard. However, under SI the preferred term is mass. 
1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1. 7 This specification and the applicable material specifica­
tions are expressed in both inch-pound units and SI units. 
However, unless the order specifies the applicable "M" speci­
fication designation (SI units), the material shall be furnished 
to inch-pound units. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3.1.2.1 Discussion-In all carbon steels small quantities of 
certain residual elements unavoidably retained from raw ma­
terials are sometimes found which are not specified or required, 
such as copper, nickel, molybdenum, chromium, and so forth. 
These elements are considered as incidental and are not 
normally determined or reported. 
3.1.3 high-strength, low-alloy steel, n-specific group of 
steels in which higher strength, and in some cases additional 
resistance to atmospheric corrosion or improved formability, 
are obtained by moderate amounts of one or more alloying 
elements. 
3.1.4 Product Types: 
3.1.5 hot-rolled sheet, n-manufactured by hot-rolling slabs 
in a continuous mill to the required thickness and can be 
supplied in coils or cut lengths as specified.

NoTE 2-The changes in width limits with the publication of A568/ 
A568M - 06a result in a change in tensile testing direction for material 
from 0.180 in. [4.5 mm] to 0.230 in. exclusive [6.0 mm exclusive] over 
48 in. [1200 mm] wide. Material formerly tested in the transverse 
direction will be tested in the longitudinal direction. This is expected to 
result in some changes in reported properties. The purchaser is advised to 
discuss this change with the supplier. 
3.1.6 cold-rolled sheet, n-manufactured from hot-rolled 
descaled coils by cold reducing to the desired thickness, 
generally followed by annealing to recrystallize the grain 
structure. If the sheet is not annealed after cold reduction it is 
known as full hard with a hardness of 84 HRB minimum and 
can be used for certain applications where ductility and flatness 
are not required. 
( 1) Cold-rolled carbon sheet is commonly classified by size 
as follows:

8 When no special edge or finish (other than matte, commercial bright, or luster 
finish) or single strand rolling of widths, or both under 24 in. [600 mm] is not 
specified or required. 
3.1.6.1 Discussion-Steel products are available in various 
thickness, width, and length combinations depending upon 
equipment and processing capabilities of various manufactur­
ers and processors. Historic limitations of a product based upon 
dimensions (thickness, width, and length) do not take into 
account current production and processing capabilities. To 
qualify any product for a particular product specification 
requires all appropriate and necessary tests be performed and 
that the results meet the limits prescribed in that product 
specification. If the necessary tests required by a product 
specification cannot be conducted, the product cannot be 
qualified to that specification. This general requirements speci­
fication contains permitted variations for the commonly avail­
able sizes. Permitted variations for other sizes are subject to 
agreement between the customer and the manufacturer or 
processor, whichever is applicable. 
3.1.7 retests, n-additional test, or tests, made from the 
original material when the original test did not meet the 
appropriate acceptance criteria required by a product specifi­
cation and the failure was mechauical in natures as described in 
Section 11. 
3.1.8 resample, n-additional test or tests made when the 
test on the original sample did not meet the appropriate 
acceptance criteria required by the product specification, but 
possibly requiring that the material in question have an 
appropriate amount discarded prior to securing the new sample 
or samples. 
3.1.9 steel manufacturer, n-the orgauization that directly 
controls or is responsible for the melting and refining of steel 
and the conversion of that steel into semifinished steel products 
known as slabs either through continuous casting, conventional 
or compact methods, or ingot casting and subsequent conver­
sion of the ingots to slabs, and for one or more additional 
operations such as testing, marking, loading for shipment, and 
certification. 
3.1.10 coil processor, n-the orgauization that directly con­
trols or is responsible for operations involved in processing the 
coil such as leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, 
blanking, slitting, pickling, cold rolling (cold reduction), heat 
treating, temper rolling, coating, packaging, marking, loading 
for shipment, and certification. 
3 .1.10.1 Discussion-The processing operations need not be 
controlled by the orgauization that hot rolls the slab into a coil. 
If only one organization controls or is responsible for (or both) 
the hot-rolling and processing operations, that organization is 
termed the manufacturer. If more than one organization con­
trols or is responsible for (or both) hot-rolling and processing 
operations, the organization that controls and is responsible for 
the hot-rolling is termed the hot roll manufacturer and the 
organization or organizations controlling and responsible for 
the processing operations is/are termed the processor or pro­
cessors. Likewise, one organization may be the manufacturer 
of the hot roll coil and another the manufacturer of the cold roll 
coil. In such case, the orgauization responsible for the conver­
sion of the hot roll coil to a cold roll coil and other processing 
operations will also be termed the cold roll manufacturer and 
organizations performing additional processing operations to 
the cold roll coil will be termed the coil processor or coil 
processors. 
3.1.11 hot roll manufacturer, n-the organization that di­
rectly controls or is responsible for the conversion of steel 
slabs, by hot-rolling into coils, and for one or more additional 
operations such as leveling, cutting to length, testing, 
inspection, blanking, slitting, pickling, cold rolling, heat 
treating, coating, packaging, marking, loading for shipment, 
and certification. 
3.1.12 cold roll manufacturer, n-the orgauization that di­
rectly controls or is responsible for the conversion of hot roll 
coils into cold roll coils, and for one or more additional 
operations such as pickling, annealing, temper rolling, slitting, 
cutting to length, testing, inspection, blanking, coating, 
packaging, marking, loading for shipment, and certification. 
3.2 Refer to Terminology A941 for additional definitions of 
terms used in this standard. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
980 
4.1 Unless otherwise specified, hot-rolled material shall be 
furnished hot-rolled, not annealed, not pickled. 
4.2 Coil breaks, stretcher strains, and fluting can occur 
during the user's processing of hot-rolled or hot-rolled pickled 
sheet. When any of these features are detrimental to the 
application, the manufacturer shall be notified at time of 
ordering in order to properly process the sheet. 
4.3 Cold-rolled carbon steel sheet is available as discussed 
in 10.2, 10.3, and in Table 1. 
4.4 Unless specified as a full-hard product, cold-rolled sheet 
is annealed after being cold reduced to thickness. The 
annealed, cold-rolled sheet can be used as annealed last (dead 
soft) for unexposed end-use applications. When cold-rolled 
sheet is used for unexposed applications and coil breaks are a 
hazard in uncoiling, it may be necessary to further process the 
material. In this case the manufacturer should be consulted.

specified range. 
5.4 Sampling for Product Analysis: 
5.4.1 To indicate adequately the representative composition 
_ ou ca§!_by_groduct analysis_,_ it is_general practice. to-select-­
samples to represent the steel, as fairly as possible, from a 
minimum number of pieces as follows: 3 pieces for lots up to 
15 tons incl, and 6 pieces for lots over 15 tons (see Practice 
E59). 
5.4.2 When the steel is subject to tension test requirements, 
samples for product analysis may be taken either by drilling 
entirely through the used tension test specimens themselves, or 
as covered in 5.4.3. 
5.4.3 When the steel is not subject to tension test 
requirements, the samples for analysis must be taken by 
milling or drilling entirely through the sheet in a sufficient 
number of places so that the samples are representative of the 
entire sheet or strip. The sampling may be facilitated by folding 
the sheet both ways, so that several samples may be taken at 
one drilling. Steel subjected to certain heating operations by 
the purchaser may not give chemical analysis results that 
properly represent its original composition. Therefore, users 
must analyze chips taken from the steel in the condition in 
which it is received from the steel manufacturer. 
5.5 Specimen Preparation-Drillings or chips must be taken 
without the application of water, oil, or other lubricant, and 
must be free of scale, grease, dirt, or other foreign substances. 
They must not be overheated during cutting to the extent of 
causing decarburization. Chips must be well mixed and those 
too coarse to pass a No. 10 sieve or too fine to remain on a 
No. 30 sieve are not suitable for proper analysis. Sieve size 
numbers are in accordance with Specification E 11. 
5.6 Test Methods-In case a referee analysis is required and 
agreed upon to resolve a dispute concerning the results of a 
chemical analysis, the procedure of performing the referee 
analysis must be in accordance with the latest issue of Test 
Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751, unless otherwise 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
6. Mechanical Properties 
6.1 The mechanical property requirements, number of 
specimens, test locations, and specimen orientation shall be in 
accordance with the applicable product specification. 
6.2 Unless otherwise specified in the applicable product 
specification, test specimens must be prepared in accordance 
with Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
6.3 Mechanical tests shall be conducted in accordance with 
Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
6.4 Bend tests where required shall be conducted in com­
pliance with Test Methods E290. 
6.5 To determine conformance with the product 
specification, a calculated value should be rounded to the 
nearest 1 ksi tensile strength and yield point or yield strength, 
and to the nearest unit in the right hand place of figures used in 
expressing the limiting value for other values in accordance 
with the rounding off method given in Practice E29. 
6.6 Structural sheet steels are commonly fabricated by cold 
bending. There are many interrelated factors that affect the 
ability of a given steel to cold form over a given radius under 
shop conditions. These factors include thickness, strength 
level, degree of restraint, relationship to rolling direction, _ 
chemistry, and microstructure. Each of the appropriate product 
specifications lists in the appendix the suggested minimum 
inside radius for cold bending. These radii should be used as 
minima for 90° bends. They presuppose "hard way" bending 
(bend axis parallel to rolling direction) and reasonably good 
shop forming practices. Where possible, the use of larger radii 
or "easy way" bends are recommended for improved perfor­
mance. 
6. 7 Fabricators should be aware that cracks may initiate 
upon bending a sheared or burned edge. This is not considered 
to be a fault of the steel but is rather a function of the induced

7. General Requirements for Delivery 
7.1 The products covered by this specification are produced 
to inch-pound or metric decimal thickness only and the 
appropriate thickness tolerances apply.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-568/SA-568M (ASTM A568/A568M) 
7 .2 Steel may be produced as ingot-cast or strand-cast. 
When different grades of strand-cast steel are sequentially cast, 
identification and separation of the transition material is 
required. 
8. Dimensions, Tolerances, and Allowances 
8.1 Dimensions, tolerances, and allowances applicable to 
products covered by this specification are contained in Tables 
3-20 [Annex Al, Tables Al.l-Al.17]. The appropriate toler­
ance tables shall be identified in each individual specification. 
8.2 The appropriate thickness tolerance tables for measure­
ments taken 3/s in. [10 mm] from the edge are found in Section 
S 1 of the Supplementary Requirements in this specification. 
See the appropriate product specification for instructions on 
how to specify. 
8.3 When thickness is measured using hand held microm­
eters refer to Practice A1073/A1073M. 
8.4 Flatness Tolerances: 
8.4.1 Standard flatness tolerances are contained in Tables 13 
and 14 for hot-rolled sheet and Table 20 for cold-rolled sheet. 
8.4.2 Measurement techniques for flatness characteristics 
are described in Practice A1030/Al030M. 
8.4.3 Two alternative methods for flatness determination are 
the use of I-units and percent steepness. A description of these 
two alternative methods is contained in Practice A1030/ 
A1030M, as well as Appendix X5. 
8.4.3.1 The use of I-units or percent steepness as a flatness 
standard is subject to negotiation between the purchaser and 
the producer. 
8.4.3.2 Measurement techniques for I-units, percent 
steepness, and rejection limits are subject to negotiation 
between the purchaser and the producer. 
9. Finish and Condition 
9.1 Hot-rolled sheet has a surface with an oxide or scale 
resulting from the hot-rolling operation. The oxide or scale can 
be removed by piclding or blast cleaning when required for 
press-work operations or welding. Hot-rolled and hot-rolled 
descaled sheet is not generally used for exposed parts where 
- sutface-is-0f prime_importanc_e_._ _ _ _ _ _ 
particular contour. They may also contain some edge 
imperfections, the more common types of which are cracked 
edges, thin edges (feather), and damaged edges due to handling 
or processing and which should not extend in beyond the 
ordered width. These edge conditions are detrimental where 
joining of the mill edges by welding is practiced. When the 
purchaser intends to shear or to blank, a sufficient width 
allowance should be made when purchasing to ensure obtain­
ing the desired contour and size of the pattern sheet. The 
manufacturer may be consulted for guidance. Cut edges are the 
normal edges which result from the shearing, slitting, or 
trimming of mill-edge sheet. 
9.1.1.1 The ends of plain hot-rolled mill-edge coils are 
irregular in shape and are referred to as uncropped ends. Where 
such ends are not acceptable, the purchaser's order should so 
specify. Processed coils such as pickled or blast cleaned are 
supplied with square-cut ends. 
9.2 Cold-rolled carbon sheet (exposed) is intended for those 
applications where surface appearance is of primary impor­
tance. This class will meet requirements for controlled surface 
texture, surface quality, and flatness. It is normally processed 
by the manufacturer to be free of stretcher strain and fluting. 
Subsequent user roller leveling immediately before fabrication 
will minimize strain resulting from aging. 
9.2.1 Cold-rolled carbon sheet, when ordered for exposed 
applications, can be supplied in the following finishes: 
9.2.1.1 Matte finish is a dull finish, without luster, produced 
by rolling on rolls that have been roughened by mechanical or 
chemical means to various degrees of surface texture depend­
ing upon application. With some surface preparation matte 
finish is suitable for decorative painting. It is not generally 
recommended for bright plating. 
9 .2.1.2 Commercial bright finish is a relatively bright finish 
having a surface texture intermediate between that of matte and 
luster finish. With some surface preparation commercial bright 
finish is suitable for decorative painting or certain plating 
applications. If sheet is deformed in fabrication the surface 
may roughen to some degree and areas so affected will require 
surface preparation to restore surface texture to that of the 
undeformed areas; 
9.1.1 Hot-rolled sheet can be supplied with mill edges or cut 
edges as specified. Mill edges are the natural edges resulting 
from the hot-rolling operation. They do not conform to any 
~2.13 Luster finish 1s asmootfioright 1inisli produced by -
rolling on ground rolls and is suitable for decorative painting or 
plating with additional special surface preparation by the user.

8 The tolerances provided in the table are based on minimum thickness (tolerance over, no tolerance under). For nominal thickness, the tolerance is divided equally over

c Where an ellipsis ( ... ) appears in the table, the requirements have not been defined. 
The luster may not be retained after fabrication; therefore, the 
formed parts will require surface preparation to make them 
suitable for bright plating. 
9.3 Cold-rolled carbon sheet, when intended for unexposed 
applications, is not subject to limitations on degree and 
frequency of surface imperfections, and restrictions on texture 
and mechanical properties are not applicable. When ordered as 
"annealed last," the product will have coil breaks and a 
tendency toward fluting and stretcher straining. Unexposed 
cold-rolled sheet may contain more surface imperfections than 
exposed cold-rolled sheet because steel applications, process­
ing procedures, and inspection standards are less stringent. 
9.4 Cold-rolled high-strength low-alloy sheet is supplied 
with a matte finish, unless otherwise specified. 
9.5 The cold-rolled products covered by this specification 
are furnished with cut edges and square cut ends, unless 
otherwise specified.

9.6.2 Hot-rolled pickled or descaled sheet is customarily 
furnished oiled. If the product is not to be oiled, it must be so 
specified since the cleaned surface is prone to rusting. 
9.6.3 Cold-rolled products covered by this specification can 
be furnished oiled or not oiled as specified. 
9.7 Sheet steel in coils or cut lengths may contain surface 
imperfections that can be removed with a reasonable amount of 
metal finishing by the purchaser. 
10. Workmanship 
10.1 Cut lengths shall have a workmanlike appearance and 
shall not have imperfections of a nature or degree for the 
product, the grade, class, and the quality ordered that will be 
detrimental to the fabrication of the finished part. 
10.2 Coils may contain some abnormal imperfections that 
render a portion of the coil unusable since the inspection of 
coils does not afford the producer the same opportunity to 
remove portions containing imperfections, as in the case with 
cut lengths. 
10.3 Surface Conditions: 
10.3.1 Exposed cold-rolled sheet is intended for applica­
tions where surface appearance is of primary importance, that 
is, exposed applications. Unexposed or annealed cold-rolled 
sheet is intended for applications where surface appearance is 
not of primary importance, that is, unexposed applications. 
10.3.2 Cut lengths for exposed applications shall not in­
clude individual sheets having major surface imperfections 
(holes, loose slivers, and pipe) and repetitive minor surface 
imperfections. Cut lengths may contain random minor surface 
imperfections that can be removed with a reasonable amount of 
metal finishing by the purchaser. These imperfections shall be 
acceptable to the purchaser within the manufacturer's pub­
lished standards. 
10.3.3 For coils for exposed applications, it is not possible 
to remove the surface imperfections listed in 10.3.2. Coils will 
contain such imperfections which shall be acceptable to the 
purchaser within the manufacturer's published standards. Coils 
contain more surface imperfections than cut lengths because 
the producer does not have the same opportunity to sort 
portions containing such imperfections, as is possible with cut 
lengths. 
10.3.4 Cut lengths for unexposed applications shall not 
include individual sheets having major surface imperfections 
such as holes, loose slivers, and pipe. In addition, unexposed 
cut lengths can be expected to contain more minor imperfec­
tions such as pits, scratches, sticker breaks, edge breaks, 
pinchers, cross breaks, roll marks, and other surface imperfec­
tions than exposed. These imperfections shall be acceptable to 
the purchaser without limitation. 
10.3.5 For coils for unexposed applications, it is not pos­
sible to remove the surface imperfections listed in 10.3.4. Coils

able. Minor imperfections shall be acceptable to the purchaser 
within the manufacturer's published standards. Unexposed 
coils contain more surface imperfections than exposed coils. 
11. Retests and Disposition of Non-Conforming Material 
11.1 Retests: 
11.1.1 Unless otherwise prohibited by the product 
specification, retests are permitted under the following circum­
stances: 
11.1.1.1 If any tension test specimen shows defective ma­
chining or develops flaws, it must be discarded and another 
specimen substituted. 
11.1.1.2 If the percent elongation of any tension test speci­
men is less than that specified and any part of the fracture is 
more than ¾ in. [20 mm] from the center of the gauge length 
of a 2-in. [50-mm] specimen, or is outside the middle half of

11.1.2 The retest specimen shall be taken either adjacent to 
the first failed specimen, or selected at random from the 
material to be certified to the specification. 
11.1.3 If the results of a retest satisfy the specified tension 
test requirements and all other requirements of the applicable 
specification are satisfied, the material shall be accepted. 
11.2 Disposition of Non-Conforming Material: 
11.2.1 In those cases where the lot is found to be non­
conforming, and resampling of non-conforming material is not 
prohibited by the specification, resampling is permitted under 
the following circumstances and using the following practices: 
11.2.1.1 If the results of an original tension test or retest 
specimen fail to satisfy the specification requirements, and the 
failed test results are not related to the conditions described in 
11.1, the lot shall be quarantined and resampled for certifica­
tion of the non-conforming material to the specification re­
quirements. 
11.2.1.2 Resampling for certification of the non-conforming 
material shall include the discarding of out-of-specification 
material and the resampling of the lot. The resampling shall be 
appropriate to the specific out-of-specification condition and 
the processing history of the lot. 
11.2.1.3 A maximum of two resampling efforts shall be 
permitted. If after conducting two resampling efforts, the 
material does not satisfy the specification requirements, the lot 
shall be rejected. 
12. Inspection 
12.1 When purchaser's order stipulates that inspection and 
tests (except product analyses) for acceptance on the steel be 
made prior to shipment from the mill, the manufacturer shall 
afford the purchaser's inspector all reasonable facilities to 
satisfy him that the steel is being produced and furnished in 
accordance with the specification. Mill inspection by the 
purchaser shall not interfere unnecessarily with the manufac­
tnrer' s operation. 
14.2 The manufacturer or processor shall issue a test report 
or optional certificate of compliance, or both, when required by 
the purchase order or the specification. 
14.3 The test report shall show the heat analysis and the 
results of all tests required by the purchase order and seller and 
by the specification. 
14.4 The certificate of compliance shall include a statement 
that the product was manufactured and tested in accordance 
with the requirements of the specification and that the test 
results conform to the requirements of the specification. 
Norn 4-The heat analysis, results of all tests, and the certificate of 
compliance may be reported separately on in a combined report. 
14.5 Steel processors shall pass transfer data supplied by the 
steel manufacturer provided the processing has not altered the 
attributes represented. In cases where the steel is retested the 
processor is responsible for the accuracy of the data and shall 
maintain traceability back to its source. Retesting for heat 
analysis shall be done in accordance with the specification Test 
Methods A751. The report shall clearly identify the physical 
product it represents. 
14.6 Test rep01is and certificates of compliance shall pro­
vide information necessary to identify the product represented; 
for example the manufacturer's name or brand, the processor's 
name or brand or the seller's name or brand, ASTM specifi­
cation number and year date, product designation, type or 
class, as applicable, and all other information necessary to 
completely identify the material. 
14.7 A signature is not required on test reports or certifica­
tions. However, the document shall clearly identify the orga­
nization submitting the document. Notwithstanding the ab­
sence of a signature, the organization submitting the document 
is responsible for the content of the document. 
14.8 When required, copies of the original material manu­
facturer's test report shall be included with any subsequent test 
report.

13.3 Samples that are representative of the rejected material requirements of 14.3 through 14.6. 
shall be made available to the manufacturer. In the event that 
the manufacturer is dissatisfied with the rejection, he may 
request a rehearing. 
14. Test Reports and Certification 
14.1 When test repo1is are required by the purchase order or 
the material specification, the supplier shall report the results of 
all test required by the material specification and the order.

Xl. AGING EFFECTS ON FORMABILITY OF COLD-ROLLED CARBON-STEEL SHEET PRODUCTS 
Xl.1 Cold-rolled carbon-steel sheet products exhibit maxi­
mum formability in the annealed last, or dead-soft, condition. 
However, many sheet products are not suitable for exposed 
applications in the dead-soft condition because Luder's lines 
(sometimes referred to as "stretcher strains" or "fluting") may 
develop during subsequent forming. This problem is avoided in 
most cases by temper rolling the sheet after annealing. After 
temper rolling, however, some sheet products are susceptible to 
aging. Aging refers to a gradual increase in yield strength and 
corresponding decrease in ductility during storage after temper 
rolling. Aging always has a negative effect on formability and, 
when aging leads to the redevelopment of an upper yield point, 
lt in renewed susce tibilit to fluting. 
Xl .2 Aging can occur when interstitial solute atoms, carbon 
or nitrogen, are present in the steel. Solute carbon or nitrogen 
atoms are those not chemically combined with other elements 
in the steel (as carbides or nitrides, for example). Over time, 
these carbon or nitrogen interstitial solute atoms diffuse to 
crystalline imperfections within the steel and, in so doing, give 
rise to aging. The extent to which aging occurs depends on the 
interstitial solute level and the combination of temperature and 
time to which the steel is exposed after temper rolling. In 
general, higher interstitial solute levels result in larger strength 
increases during storage; the rate of aging increases with 
increasing temperature. As described as follows, the final 
interstitial solute level and aging characteristics depend on the 
chemical composition of the steel as well as specific sheet­
processing methods used by the steel producer. 
Xl .3 Low-Carbon Steels-In conventional aluminum-killed 
low-carbon steels, the level of interstitial solute is affected 
mainly through the fonnation of aluminum nitride and iron 
carbides within the steel during processing, which is influenced 
by the manner in which annealing is performed. 
Xl.3.1 Many sheet products are annealed in batches of 
large, tightly wound coils. During heating, any solute nitrogen 
present in the full-hard sheet combines with aluminum to form 
aluminum nitride. Subsequent cooling is very slow and allows 
essentially all of the carbon to precipitate as iron carbide. Final 
interstitial solute levels are very low and, as a result, batch­
annealed low-carbon steels have excellent resistance to aging. 
Xl.3.1.1 Dee drawing steel (DDS) sheet typically is batch-
annealed and has excellent aging resistance. 1 temper 
rolling, DDS sheet is suitable for use in many exposed 
applications with severe forming requirements. 
Xl.3.2 Cold-rolled low-carbon steels are sometimes pro­
cessed in a continuous annealing line, in which the full-hard 
sheet is uncoiled, passed through an annealing furnace, and 
then rewound in a continuous manner. Heating and cooling 
rates are much higher than those found in batch annealing. The 
faster cooling, in particular, results in higher levels of intersti­
tial solute in the product as compared with batch annealing. 
The manner in which the sheet is cooled can be controlled to 
minimize the solute carbon level, and temper rolling is effec­
tive for reducing fluting tendencies. However, continuous­
annealed low-carbon steels are more prone to subsequent aging 
than batch-annealed steels.

SA-568/SA-568M (ASTM A568/A568M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Xl.3.2.1 Low-carbon commercial steel (CS) and drawing 
steel (DS) sheet are available as either batch- or continuous­
annealed products, depending on the facilities of a given 
producer. To minimize aging effects in continuous-annealed 
products, rotation of stock by fabricating the oldest material 
first is recommended. 
Xl .4 Interstitial-Free Steels-Interstitial-free steels have 
essentially no interstitial solutes and, as a result, are nonaging. 
Processing involves vacuum degassing during refining of the 
liquid steel, as well as additions of elements that form very 
stable carbides and nitrides, such as titanium or columbium 
(niobium). These steps ensure that total interstitial levels are 
very low, and that the interstitials are all chemically combined 
( or stabilized) in the fmm of alloy carbides or nitrides. 
Interstitial-free steels are nonaging regardless of whether 
annealing is conducted in a continuous or batch manner. 
Xl.4.1 Extra-deep drawing steel (EDDS) must be vacuum 
degassed and stabilized. This nonaging, interstitial-free product 
is suitable for exposed applications with the most severe 
forming requirements. 
Xl.5 Bake-Hardenable Steels-Bake-hardenable steels are 
a special product class with controlled interstitial solute levels 
and aging behavior. These steels are processed to have mod­
erate aging resistance, to permit forming while the steel is in its 
most ductile condition. Aging occurs largely during a subse­
quent thermal treatment (for example, paint-curing), which 
results in desirable hardening of the final part for better 
durability. 
Xl.5.1 Continuous-annealed low-carbon steels can exhibit 
significant bake-hardening, as well as certain vacuum-degassed 
and batch-annealed steels. 
X2. STANDARD CHEMICAL RANGES AND LIMITS 
X2.l Standard chemical ranges and limits are prescribed for 
carbon steels in Table X2.1. 
X2.2 Chemical ranges for non-standard steels are prescribed

FIG. X4.1 Forming Limit Curve 
the forming limit curve is lower. The magnitude of the 
downgrade displacement is specific to each material; therefore, 
current material information should be consulted to determine 
placement of the forming limit curve. 
X4.3 Procedure 
X4.3.l Obtain a sheet sample of "known quality," the sheet 
quality being established by either supplier designation, con­
sumer purchase order, or most preferred tensile data obtained 
from a companion sheet sample. 
X4.3.2 Obtain or prepare a negative on stencil with selected 
circles in a uniform pattern. The circles may be 2.5 to 25.0 mm 
in diameter; the most convenient diameter is 5.0 mm because 
it is easy to read and the gauge spacing is short enough to show 
the maximum strain in a specific location on the part. 
X4.3.3 The sheet metal blanks should be cleaned to remove 
excess oil and dirt; however, some precoated sheets can be 
etched without removing the coating. The area(s) to be etched 
should be detem1ined from observation of panels previously 
formed; generally, the area that has a split problem is selected 
for etching. Normally, the convex side of the radius is gridded. 
If sufficient time is available, the entire blank may be etched, 
since valuable information can be obtained about the move­
ment of metal in stamping a part when strains can be evaluated 
in what may appear to be noncritical areas. Additionally, for 
complex shapes it may be desirable to etch both surfaces of 
blanks so that the strains that occur in reverse draws can be 
determined. 
X4.3.4 The sheet metal blanks may be etched by a photo­
graphic or electrochemical method. In the former method of 
photosensitive solution, for example, 50 % Kodak Photo Resist 
(KPR) emulsion and 50 % KPR-thinner, is sprayed onto the 
sheet. The emulsion is dried by baking the sheet at 65 °C for 
15 min or by just standing it for several hours at room 
temperature in a dark room. The latter should be employed in 
materials that age and, hence, become stronger when baked at 
65 °C. The negative is placed on the emulsion, held intimately 
in contact with the sheet, and exposed to a strong ultraviolet 
light source for 1 to 1 ½ min. The sheet is developed for 30 to 
45 s in KPR developer, rinsed with water, and sprayed with 
alcohol to set the resist. It is again rinsed with water and then 
sprayed with KPR black dye to reveal the etched circles. 
X4.3.5 In the electrochemical method, the etch pad is 
saturated with an appropriate electrolyte. Various electrolytes 
are available from suppliers of the etching equipment. Some 
electrolytes are more effective than others for etching certain 
surfaces, such as terne plate and other metallic coated steels. A 
mst-inhibiting solution is preferred for steel sheets. 
X4.3.6 A ground clamp for the transformer of suitable 
amperage (10 to 50 A is usually used) is fastened to the blank 
1002

=== Page 1101 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-568/SA-568M (ASTM A568/A568M) 
and the second lead is attached to the etch pad. Although the 
current may be turned on at this time, caution should be taken 
not to lay the pad on the sheet blank as it will arc. It is 
advisable to refrain from touching the metal of the etch pad and 
the grounded sheet blank. 
X4.3.7 The stencil is placed with the plastic coating against 
the sheet surface in the area to be etched. Wetting the stencil 
with a minimum amount of electrolyte will assist in smoothing 
out the wrinkles and gives a more uniform etch. The etch pad 
is now positioned on the stencil and the current turned on, if it 
is not already on. Apply suitable pressure to the pad. Only the 
minimum time necessary to produce a clear etched pattern 
should be used. The etching time will vary with the amperage 
available from the power source and the stencil area, as well as 
the pad area in contact with the stencil. Rocker-type etch pads 
give good prints and require less amperage than flat-surfaced 
pads. Excessive current causes stencil damage. 
X4.3.8 The etching solution activates the surface of the 
metal and may cause rusting unless it is inhibited. After the 
desired area has been etched, the blank should be wiped or 
rinsed, dried, and neutralized. 
X4.3.9 The etched blank is now ready for forming. The 
lubricants and press conditions should simulate production 
situations. If a sequence of operations is used in forming a part, 
it is desirable to etch sufficient blanks so that each operation 
can be studied. 
X4.4 Measurement of Strain After Forming 
X4.4.1 After forming, the circles are generally distorted into 
elliptical shapes (Fig. X4.2). These ellipses have major and 
minor strain axes. The major strain (e 1 ) is always defined to be 
the direction in which the greatest positive strain has occurred 
without regard to original blank edges or the sheet rolling 
direction. The minor strain (e 2 ) is defined to be 90° to the major 
strain direction. 
X4.4.2 There are several methods for determining the major 
and minor strains of the formed panel. Typical tools are a pair 
of dividers and a scale ruled in 0.5 mm. For sharp radii, a thin 
plastic scale that can follow the contour of the stamping can be 
used to determine the dimensions of the ellipses. (Scales are 
available to read the percent strain directly.)

X4.5 Evaluation of Strain Measurements 
X4.5.1 The e 1 strain is always positive while the e 2 strain 
may be zero, positive, or negative, as indicated on the forming 
limit curve chart (Fig. X4.1). The maximum e 1 and associated 
e 2 values measured in critical areas on the formed part are 
plotted on the graph paper containing the forming limit curve 
by locating the point of intersections of the e 1 , e 2 strains. 
X4.5.2 If this point is on or below the "safety band" of the 
forming limit curve, the strain should not cause breakage. 
Points further below the curve indicate that a less ductile 
material of a lower grade may be applied. Points above the 
"safety band" show that fabrication has induced strains that 
could result in breakage. Therefore, in evaluation on stampings 
exhibiting these strains, efforts should be made to provide an 
e 1 , e 2 strain combination that would lie on or below the "safety 
band" of the forming limit curve. A different e 1 , e 2 strain 
combination can be obtained through changes of one or more 
of the forming variables such as die conditions, · lubricants, 
blank size, thickness, or material grade. It should be noted at 
this time that these conclusions are derived from a reference 
base being the steel "quality" used to fabricate the grid 
stamping. 
X4.5.3 When attempting to change the relationship of e 1 
and e 2 strains, it should be noted that on the forming limit curve 
the most severe condition for a given e 1 strain is at O % e 2 
strain. This means the metal works best when it is allowed to 
deform in two dimensions, e 1 and e 2 , rather than being 
restricted in one dimension. A change in e 2 to decrease the 
severity can be made by changing one of the previously 
mentioned forming variables of the die design, for example, 
improving lubrication on the tension-tension side will increase 
e 2 and decrease the severity. 
X4.5.4 In addition to the forming limit curve, the e 1 e 2 strain 
measurements may be used to evaluate the material require­
ments on the basis of strain gradients, as illustrated in Fig. 
X4.3, or by plotting contours of equivalent strain levels on the

Specification for 
High-Strength Low-Alloy Columbium-Vanadium Structural 
Steel 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers five grades of high-strength 
low-alloy structural steel shapes, plates, sheet piling, and bars. 
Grades 42 [290], 50 [345], and 55 [380] are intended for 
riveted, bolted, or welded structures. Grades 60 [415] and 65 
[ 450] are intended for riveted or bolted construction of bridges, 
or for riveted, bolted, or welded construction in other applica­
tions. 
1.2 For applications, such as welded bridge construction, 
where notch toughness is important, notch toughness require­
ments are to be negotiated between the purchaser and the 
producer. 
1.3 Specification A588/A588M shall not be substituted for 
Specification A572/ A572M without agreement between the 
purchaser and the supplier. 
1.4 The use of columbium (niobium), vanadium, titanium, 
nitrogen, or combinations thereof, within the limitations noted 
in Section 5, is required; the selection of type (1, 2, 3, or 5) is 
at the option of the producer, unless otherwise specified by the 
purchaser. (See Supplementary Requirement S90.) 
1.5 The maximum thicknesses available in the grades and 
products covered by this specification are shown in Table 1. 
1.6 When the steel is to be welded, a welding procedure 
suitable for the grade of steel and intended use or service is to 
be utilized. See Appendix X3 of Specification A6/ A6M for 
information on weldability. 
1.7 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system is to 
be used independently of the other, without combining values 
in any way. 
1.8 The text of this specification contains notes or footnotes, 
or both, that provide explanatory material. Such notes and 
footnotes, excluding those in tables and figures, do not contain 
any mandatory requirements. 
1.9 For structural products produced from coil and fur­
nished without heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the 
additional requirements, including additional testing require­
ments and the reporting of additional tests, of Specification 
A6/ A6M apply. 
1.10 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the

3. General Requirements for Delivery 
3.1 Structural products furnished under this specification 
shall conform to the requirements of the cmrent edition of 
Specification A6/ A6M, for the specific structural product 
ordered, unless a conflict exists in which case this specification 
shall prevail. 
3.2 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into a finished structural product. 
Structural products produced from coil means structural prod­
ucts that have been cut to individual lengths from a coil. The 
processor directly controls, or is responsible for, the operations 
involved in the processing of a coil into a finished structural 
product. Such operations include decoiling, leveling or 
straightening, hot-forming or cold-forming (if applicable), 
cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, heat treat­
ment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for shipment, 
and certification. 
NoTE 1-For structural products produced from coil and furnished 
without heat treatment or with stress relieving only, two test results are to 
be reported for each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding 
structural products produced from coil are described in Specification 
A6/A6M.

NoTE 2-The changes in width limits with the publication of A568/ 
A568M - 06a result in a change in tensile testing direction for material 
from 0.180 in. [4.5 mm] to 0.230 in. exclusive [6.0 mm exclusive] over 
48 in. [1200 mm] wide. Material formerly tested in the transverse 
direction will be tested in the longitudinal direction. This is expected to 
result in some changes in reported properties. The purchaser is advised to 
discuss this change with the supplier. 
3.1.6 cold-rolled sheet, n-manufactured from hot-rolled 
descaled coils by cold reducing to the desired thickness, 
generally followed by annealing to recrystallize the grain 
structure. If the sheet is not annealed after cold reduction it is 
known as full hard with a hardness of 84 HRB minimum and 
can be used for certain applications where ductility and flatness 
are not required. 
( 1) Cold-rolled carbon sheet is commonly classified by size 
as follows:
