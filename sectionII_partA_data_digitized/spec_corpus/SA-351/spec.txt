SA-351/SA-351M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Castings, Austenitic, for Pressure-Containing Parts 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers austenitic steel castings for 
valves, flanges, fittings, and other pressure-containing parts 
(Note 1). 
Norn 1-Carbon steel castings for pressure-containing parts are cov­
ered by Specification A216/A216M, low-alloy steel castings by Specifi­
cation A217/A217M, and duplex stainless steel castings by Specification 
A995! A995M. 
1.2 A number of grades of austenitic steel castings are 
included in this specification. Since these grades possess 
varying degrees of suitability for service at high temperatures 
or in corrosive environments, it is the responsibility of the 
purchaser to determine which grade shall be furnished. Selec­
tion will depend on design and service conditions, mechanical 
properties, and high-temperature or corrosion-resistant 
characteristics, or both. 
1.2.1 Because of thermal instability, Grades CE20N, CF3A, 
CF3MA, and CF8A are not recommended for service at 
temperatures above 800 °F [425 °C). 
1.3 Supplementary requirements of an optional nature are 
provided for use at the option of the purchaser. The Supple­
mentary requirements shall apply only when specified indi­
vidually by the purchaser in the purchase order or contract. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
540 
1.4.1 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound 
units and in SI units; however, unless the purchase order or 
contract specifies the applicable M-specification designation 
(SI units), the inch-pound units shall apply. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets or parentheses. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

Standard Specification for 
Steel Castings, Ferritic and Martensitic, for Pressure­
Containing Parts, Suitable for Low-Temperature Service 
l. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers steel castings for valves, 
flanges, fittings, and other pressure-containing parts intended 
primarily for low-temperature service. 
1.2 Several grades of ferritic steels and one grade of 
martensitic steel are covered. Selection of analysis will depend 
on design and service conditions (Note). The temperature 
shown is the lowest temperature at which the material ordinar­
ily is required to meet the impact requirements of this 
specification (see Supplementary Requirement S22, Impact 
Test Temperatures). Users should note that hardenability of 
some of the grades mentioned may restrict the maximum size 
at which the required mechanical properties are obtainable (see 
Appendix Xl).

Norn 1--This specification covers the low-temperature requirements 
particularly pertinent for ferritic and rnartensitic steels. Certain of the 
grades of austenitic steel castings furnished in accordance with Specifi­
cation A351/ A351M have been found suitable for low-temperature service 
down to -300°F [-184"C] and others down to -425°F [-254°C]. These 
grades may be used when impact tested in accordance with Specification 
A352/A352M with energy levels and temperatures of test mutually agreed 
upon between the pnrchaser and the manufacturer. As a guide to the 
selection of e1i.ergy levels and testing temperatures, Appendix Xl should 
be consulted.

1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. Inch-pound units are applicable for material ordered to 
Specification A352 and SI units for material ordered to 
Specification A352M.

4.1.4 The supplementary requirements desired, including 
the standards of acceptance. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 All castings shall receive a heat treatment proper to their 
design and chemical composition. It should be recognized that 
liquid quenching of the forritic grades is normally required to 
meet the mechanical properties of heavier sections and will 
greatly enhance the low-temperature properties of thinner 
sections. 
5.2 Fe1Titic castings shall be furnished in the normalized and 
tempered or liquid-quenched and tempered condition, except 
for Grade LC9, which shall be liquid-quenched and tempered. 
Castings shall be tempered at a minimum of 1100°F [590°C], 
except Grade LC4, which shall be 1050°F [565°C], and Grade 
LC9, which shall be tempered in the range of 1050 to ll 75°F 
[565 to 635°C], followed by cooling in air or liquid. 
5.3 CA6NM castings shall be heat-treated by heating to 
1850°F [1010°C] minimum, and air cooling to 200°F [95°C] 
maximum before any optional intermediate temper, but shall 
cool to 100°F [40°C] maximum before the final temper, which 
shall be between 1050 and 1150°F [565 and 620°C). 
5.4 Castings shall be allowed to cool below the transforma­
tion range directly after pouring and solidification before they 
are reheated for normalizing or liquid quenching. 
5.5 Temperature Control---Fumace temperature for heat 
treating shall be controlled by use of pyrometers. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition for the grade ordered as specified in 
Table 1. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7.1 Tension Test: 
7 .1.1 Tensile properties of steel used for the castings shall 
confonn to the requirements specified in Table 1. 
7.2 Impact Test: 
7 .2.1 The notched bar impact properties of the material shall 
be determined by testing a set of three Charpy V-notch impact 
specimens for each heat at one of the standard test temperatures 
shown in Table 1, depending on the intended service tempera­
ture (see Appendix XI). The average energy value of the three 
specimens shall not be less than specified, with not more than 
549 
one value permitted below the average minimum specified and 
no value permitted below the minimum specified for a single 
specimen. 
7.2.2 The notched bar impact test shall be made in accor­
dance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
7.2.3 Impact test specimens shall be machined to the form 
and dimensions shown in Test Methods and Definitions A370, 
Fig. 11. 
8. Quality 
8.1 The surface of the casting shall be examined visually 
and shall be free of adhering sand, scale, cracks, and hot tears. 
Other surface discontinuities shall meet the visual acceptance 
standards specified in the order. Visual Method SP-55 or other 
visual standards may be used to define acceptable surface 
discontinuities and finish. Unacceptable visual surface discon­
tinuities shall be removed and their removal verified by visual 
examination of the resultant cavities. When methods involving 
high temperature are used in the removal of discontinuities, 
castings shall be preheated to at least the minimum tempera­
tures in Table 2. 
8.2 When additional inspection is desired, Supplementary 
Requirements S4, S5, and SlO, may be ordered. 
8.3 The castings shall not be peened, plugged, or impreg­
nated to stop leaks. 
9. Repair by Welding 
9.1 Repairs shall be made using procedures and welders in 
accordance with Practice A488/ A488M. 
9.2 Welding of Grade LC9 shall be accomplished using 
nonmagnetic filler material of AWS classification ENiCrFe-2, 
and shall require liquid penetrant inspection of the weld 
(Supplementary Requirement S6) when magnetic particle in­
spection (Supplementary Requirement S4) is specified for the 
casting. 
9.3 Weld repairs shall. be inspected to the same quality 
standards that are used to inspect the castings. When castings 
are produced with Supplementary Requirement S4 specified, 
weld repairs shall be inspected by magnetic particle examina­
tion to the same standards that are used to inspect the castings. 
When castings are produced with Supplementary Requirement 
S5 specified, weld repairs on castings that have leaked on 
hydrostatic tests, or on castings in which the depth of any 
cavity prepared for repair welding exceeds 20 % of the wall 
thickness or 1 in. [25 mm] whichever is smaller, or on castings 
in which any cavity prepared for welding is greater than 
approximately 10 in.2 [65 cm 2 shall be radiographed to the 
same standards that are used to inspect the castings. 
9.4 Castings containing any repair weld that exceeds 20 % 
of the wall thickness, or 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is smaller, 
or that exceeds approximately 10 in. 2 [65 cm 2 J in area, or that 
was made to correct hydrostatic test defects shall be stress 
relieved or heat treated after welding. This mandatory stress 
relief or heat treatment shall be in accordance with the 
procedure qualification used. When stress relief is required for 
Grade LC9, cooling shall be in still air.

APPENDIX 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. EXPLANATION OF THE USE OF NOTCHED BAR IMPACT TESTS IN DETERMINING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF 
STEELS FOR LOW-TEMPERATURE SERVICE 
Xl. 1 Years of experience and test work have shown that 
some materials, particularly ferritic steels, change from tough 
to brittle behavior with a decrease in temperature. The transi­
tion temperatures and the levels of notch toughness vary with 
different materials, depending on many factors. When materi­
als are used under conditions where brittle behavior may occur, 
there is danger that flaws, which would be considered nonhaz­
ardous if the material were tough, may propagate to disastrous 
failure of the equipment. 
Xl.2 Accordingly, many varieties of tests have been devel­
oped in an effort to evaluate the toughness of materials and the 
conditions under which they will transform from tough to 
brittle behavior. There are many opinions and shadings of 
551 
opinion as to which test is most suitable for evaluating the 
suitability of materials for service at low temperatures; how­
ever, as yet, only the Charpy impact test has received sufficient 
general acceptance and has been used as a basis for purchasing 
for sufficient time to be included in ASTM standards. Further­
more, this test is required for low-temperature service vessels 
and piping constructed in accordance with ASME Code for 
Unfired Pressure Vessels and the American National Standard 
Code for Pressure Piping (ANSI B31), respectively. These 
ASTM specifications for materials for low-temperature service 
are primarily used in piping and pressure vessel construction 
that are subjected to temperatures lower than ambient; conse­
quently, the notched bar impact test requirements are written to 
provide material that in quality and by its testing can be

=== Page 604 ===

SA-352/SA-352M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
validated for use under the construction codes. 
Xl.3 No assurance is offered that compliance with these 
requirements will provide a material that will resist brittle 
failure under all possible conditions of service to as low as the 
specified impact test temperature. It may eventually be possible 
that other types of tests will provide greater assurance of 
material suitability for low-temperature services, but at this 
time there is insufficient knowledge for agreement and general 
acceptance of some test other than the Charpy impact test. 
X 1.4 Attention is directed to the following subjects which 
have a bearing on the value of Charpy impact tests: 
Xl .4.1 Much of the original work in the field of notch 
toughness was done on wrought materials that had definite 
directional grain flow parallel to the axis of the bar, and the 
specimens were taken with the longitudinal axis of the speci­
men parallel to the axis of the bar. It has been well established 
that the results from impact of tbe same piece of steel 
may vary considerably, depending upon the orientation of the 
specimen to the direction of grain flow. Although it is known 
that specimens taken with their axis transverse to the direction 
of grain flow will have lower values depending on the amount 
of cross rolling or forging the material has received, there were 
insufficient test data to permit specific mandatory requirements 
on the impact properties of wrought materials determined in 
any direction other than parallel to the direction of grain flow. 
Except in special cases this limitation still exists. 
Xl .4.2 It is acknowledged that notched bar impact tests are 
of a qualitative rather than a quantitative nature. As yet, except 
possibly for ship steel, no satisfactory correlation has been 
possible between tests on small standardization specimens and 
the behavior of a structural under any given conditions of 
loading in service. The required values as determined by the 
Charpy V-notch impact test are arbitrary values which can be 
met by carbon and low-alloy constructional steels when tested 
at temperatures above that where their behavior changes from 
tough to brittle as judged by this test. The acceptability of this 
dividing line seems to be justified by service experience on 
carbon and certain low-alloy steels. 
Xl.4.3 The literature shows that notched bar impact 
strengths in constructional steels differ widely in accordance 
with many variables. Consequently, there is bound to be some 
discrepancy between an individual test bar and the entire part 
that it represents. No system of test bar selection can guarantee 
that every sample would meet minimum requirements. Test bar 
selection must be a compromise to generally represent the 
product. 
552 
Xl .4.4 The committees responsible for these material speci­
fications have had as an objective the selection of test speci­
mens that will represent the properties of the materials, in the 
form in which they will be used. However, accomplishment of 
this objective has only partially been realized. At this time it is 
impossible to select samples for testing that will represent all 
parts and sizes of the product involved. Particularly in fen'itic 
steels, it is impractical to remove the test bars from heavy 
sections over about 4 in. [100 mm] and expect them to show 
results as high as tests from light sections of the same material. 
The practical commercial limits on the amount of testing 
possible, as well as limits to knowledge of what results may be 
expected from testing in non-standard locations, have been 
considered in drafting these specifications. With time and 
increased knowledge, it may be possible to require more 
representative testing.

Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Double-Normalized and 
Tempered 9 °/o Nickel 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers double-normalized and tem­
pered 9 % nickel steel plates intended paiticularly for welded 
pressure vessels for cryogenic service. 
1.2 Plates produced under this specification are subject to 
impact testing at -320°F [-195°C] or at such other tempera­
tures as are agreed upon. 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the material to meet the specific mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.4 This material is susceptible to magnetization. Use of 
magnets in handling after heat treatment should be avoided if 
residual magnetism would be detrimental to subsequent fabri­
cation or service. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
ai·e to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system ai·e not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. •

5.2 Heat Treatment Procedure: 
5.2.1 First Normalizing Treatment-Heat the plate to a 
uniform temperature of 1650 ± 25°F [900 ± 15°C], hold at 
that temperature for a minimum of 1 h/in. [2.4 min/mm] of 
thickness, but in no case less than 15 min, and cool in air. 
5.2.2 Second Normalizing Treatment-Reheat the plate to a 
uniform temperature of 1450 ± 25°F [790 ± 15°C], hold at

5.2.3 Tempering Treatment-Reheat the plate to a unifmm 
temperature within the range from 1050 to 1125°F [565 to 
605°C], hold within that temperature range for a minimum of 
1 h/in. [2.4 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 15 
min, and cool in air or water quench at a rate not less than 
300°F/h [165°C/h]. 
5.2.4 If hot forming is performed after heating to a tempera­
ture within the range from 1650 to 1750°F [900 to.955°C] the 
first normalizing treatment (5.2.1) may be omitted. 
5.2.5 When the plates are heat treated by the fabricator, it 
shall be the fabricator's responsibility to apply the proper heat 
treatment and to conduct tests it deems necessary to ensure that 
the specified properties are attained. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical composition 
requirements shown in Table 1 unless otherwise modified in 
accordance with Supplementary Requirement S 17, Vacuum 
Carbon-Deoxidized Steel, in Specification A20/A20M. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7 .1 Tension Test Requirements-The material as represented 
by the tension-test specimens shall conform to the require­
ments specified in Table 2. 
7.1.1 Upon agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer, yield strength may be determined by the exten­
sion under load method, using 0.005 in.fin. [0.005 mm/mm] 
total extension. 
7.1.2 For nominal plate thicknesses of¾ in. [20 mm] and 
under, the 1 ½-in. [40-rnrn] wide rectangular specimen may be 
used for the tension test and the elongation may be determined 
in a 2-in. [50-mm] gage length that includes the fracture and 
shows the greatest elongation. 
7 .1.3 One tension test shall be taken from each plate as heat 
treated. 
7.2 Impact Test Requirements: 
555 
7 .2.1 Charpy V-notch impact tests shall be made in accor­
dance with Specification A20/ A20M. 
7.2.2 The longitudinal axis of the test specimens shall be 
transverse to the final rolling direction of the plate. 
7.2.3 Unless otherwise agreed, tests shall be conducted at 
-320°F [-195°C]. 
7.2.4 Each test specimen shall have a lateral expansion 
opposite the notch of not less than 0.015 in. [0.381 mm]. 
8. Finish

Standard Specification for 
Quenched and Tempered Alloy Steel Bolts, Studs, and Other 
Externally Threaded Fasteners 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers the chemical and mechanical 
requirements of quenched and tempered alloy steel bolts, studs, 
and other externally threaded fasteners 4 in. and under in 
diameter for application at normal atmospheric temperatures, 
where high strength is required and for limited application at 
elevated temperature (Note 1). Any alloy steel capable of 
meeting the minimum mechanical and chemical properties set 
forth in this specification may be used. 
NoTE 1-For bolts, studs, or other externally threaded fasteners, to be 
used at elevated temperatures, refer to Specification Al93/Al93M. 
1.2 Two levels of bolting strength are covered, designated 
Grades BC and BD. Selection will depend upon design and the 
stresses and service for which the product is to be used. 
NoTE 2-Quenched and tempered alloy steel bolts for structural steel 
joints up through 1 ½ in. in diameter are covered in Specification A490. 
Alloy steel bolts, studs, and other externally threaded fasteners (that is, 
heavy hex-structural bolts over 1 ½ in., hex bolts, anchor bolts, and 
countersunk bolts) exhibiting similar mechanical properties to bolts 
conforming to Specification A490 shall be covered by Grade BD of this 
specification. 
When bolts of Grade BD of this specification are considered for 
pretentioned applications in excess of 50 % of the bolt tensile strength, the 
additional requirements of head size, maximum tensile strength, nut size 
and strength, washer hardness, tests, and inspections contained in Speci­
fication A490 should be carefully considered. 
1.3 Nuts are covered in Specification A563. Unless other­
wise specified, the grade and style of nut for each grade of 
fastener shall be as follows: 
558 
Grade of Fastener and Surface Finish 
BC, plain (or with a coating of insufficient thick­
ness to require over-tapped nuts) 
BC, zinc-coated (or with a coating thickness re­
quiring over-tapped nuts) 
BD, all finishes 
Nut Grade and 
StyleA 
C, heavy hex 
DH, heavy hex 
DH, heavy hex 
A Nuts of other grades and styles having specified proof load stresses (Specifica­
tion A563, Table 3) greater than the specified grade and style of nut are suitable. 
1.4 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as the standard. 
1.5 Terms used in this specification are defined in Termi­
nology Fl 789 unless otherwise defined herein.

effective it is essential that secondary processors, distributors, 
and purchasers maintain the identification and integrity of each 
lot until the product is installed. 
9.3 Lot Processing-All fasteners shall be processed in 
accordance with a lot identification-control quality assurance 
plan. The manufacturer, secondary processors, and distributors 
shall identify and maintain the integrity of each lot of fasteners 
from raw-material selection through all processing operations 
and treatments to final packing and shipment. Each lot shall be 
assigned its own lot-identification number, each lot shall be 
tested, and the inspection test reports for each lot shall be 
retained. 
9.4 Lot Definition-A lot is a quantity of a uniquely identi­
fied fastener product of the same nominal size and length 
produced consecutively at the initial operation from a single 
mill heat of material and heat treatment lot and processed at 
one time, by the same process, in the same manner so that 
statistical sampling is valid. The identity of the lot is main­
tained throughout all subsequent operations and packaging. 
9 .5 Number of Tests~ The minimum number of tests from 
each production lot for the tests specified below shall be in 
accordance with Guide F1470. 
Hardness 
Tensile 
Proof Load

Discontinuities Section 8) 
9.5.1 The number of tests for dimensional and thread fit 
compliance shall be in accordance with the quality assurance 
provisions of the referenced dimensional standards. 
9.6 If any test specimen shows defective machining it may 
be discarded and another specimen substituted. 
10. Test Methods 
10.1 Test methods shall be conducted in accordance with 
Test Methods F606. 
10.2 Proof load, rather than yield strength determination is 
preferred and shall be the arbitration method for fasteners 1 ¼ 
in. and under in diameter. 
10.3 Hexagon bolts shall be tested by the wedge tension 
method. Fracture shall be in the body or threads of the bolt 
without any fracture at the junction of the head and body. 
10.3.1 At the option of the manufacturer, the yield strength 
test (Method 2, Yield Strength paragraph of Test Methods 
F606) and the wedge tension test (Wedge Tension Testing of 
Full-Size Product paragraph, both from the Test Method 
section of Test Methods F606) may be accomplished concur- "-
rently to satisfy 10.2 and 10.3. 
10.4 Studs and bolts other than those in 10.3 shall be tested 
by the axial tension method. 
10.4.1 At the option of the manufacturer, the yield strength 
test and the axial tension test may be accomplished concur­
rently to satisfy 10.2 and 10.4. 
10.5 The speed of testing determined with a free running 
crosshead shall be a maximum of 1/s in. (3.2 mm)/min for the 
bolt proof load (or yield strength) determination and a maxi­
mum of 1 in. (25.4 mm)/min for the tensile strength determi­
nation. 
11. Inspection 
11.1 If the inspection described in 11.2 is required by the 
purchaser, it shall be specified in the inquiry and contract or 
purchase order. 
11.2 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
free entry to all parts of the manufacturer's works that concern 
the manufacture of the material ordered. The manufacturer 
shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities to satisfy him 
that the material is being furnished in accordance with this 
specification. All tests and inspections required by the specifi­
cation that are requested by the purchaser's representative shall 
be made before shipment, and shall be conducted as not to 
interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the works. 
12. Responsibility 
12.1 The party responsible for the fastener shall be the 
organization that supplies the fastener to the purchaser. 
13. Rejection and Rehearing 
13.l Material that fails to conform to the requirements of

SA-358/SA-358M ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 
Specification for 
Electric-Fusion-Welded Austenitic Chromium-Nickel 
Stainless Steel Pipe for High-Temperature Service and 
General Applications 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers electric-fusion-welded auste­
nitic chromium-nickel stainless steel pipe suitable for corrosive 
or high-temperature service, or both, or for general applica­
tions. 
NoTE 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diaineter," "size," and "n01ninal size." 
1.2 This specification covers the grades of alloy and stain­
less steel listed in Table 1. The selection of the proper grade 
and requirements for heat treatment shall be at the discretion of 
the purchaser, dependent on the service conditions to be 
encountered. 
1.3 Five classes of pipe are covered as follows: 
1.3.l Class I-Pipe shall be double welded by processes 
employing filler metal in all passes and shall be completely 
radio graphed. 
1.3.2 Class 2-Pipe shall be double welded by processes 
employing filler metal in all passes. No radiography is re­
quired. 
1.3.3 Class 3-Pipe shall be single welded by processes 
employing filler metal in all passes and shall be completely 
radiographed. 
1.3.4 Class 4-Same as Class 3 except that the weld pass 
exposed to the inside pipe surface may be made without the 
addition of filler metal (see 6.2.2.1 and 6.2.2.2). 
l.3.5 Class 5-Pipe shall be double welded by processes 
employing filler metal in all passes and shall be spot radio­
graphed. 
1.4 Supplementary requirements covering provisions rang­
ing from additional testing to formalized procedures for 
566 
manufacturing practice are provided. Supplementary Require­
ments S 1 through S6 are included as options to be specified 
when desired. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in nonconformance with the 
specification. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

rings that remain in place are prohibited. Welding procedures, 
and welding operators shall be qualified· in accordance with 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX. 
6.2.2 Except as provided in 6.2.2.1 and 6.2.2.2, welds shall 
be made in their entirety by processes involving the deposition 
of filler metal. 
6.2.2.1 For Class 4 pipe employing multiple passes, the 
root-pass may be without the addition of filler metal. 
6.2.2.2 For Class 4 pipe, the weld surface exposed inside the 
pipe may result from a single pass made from the inside of the 
pipe without the addition of filler metal. 
6.2.2.3 All single-welded pipe shall be completely radio­
graphed. 
6.2.3 The weld surface on either side of the weld is 
permitted to be flush with the base plate or to have a reasonably 
uniform crown, not to exceed 1/s in. [3 mm]. It is pemritted at 
the option of the manufacturer or by agreement between the 
manufacturer and purchaser to remove any weld reinforce­
ment. The contour of the reinforcement should be reasonably 
smooth and free from irregularities. The deposited metal shall 
be fused uniformly into the plate surface. No concavity of 
contour is permitted unless the resulting thickness of weld 
metal is equal to or greater than the minimum thickness of the 
adjacent base metal. 
569 
6.2.4 Weld defects shall be repaired by removal to sound 
metal and rewelding. Subsequent heat treatment and examina­
tion (that is, visual, radiographic, and dye penetrant) shall be as 
required on the original welds.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-358/SA-358M 
8.1.4 Thickness-The minimum wall thickness at any point 
in the pipe shall not be more than 0.01 in. [0.3 mm] under the 
nominal thickness. 
9. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
9.1 The finished pipe shall have a workmanlike finish. 
9.2 Repair of Plate Defects by Machining or Grinding-It is 
permitted to repair pipes showing slivers, or other smface 
defects, by machining or grounding inside or outside to a depth 
that ensures the removal of all included scale and slivers, 
provided that the wall thickness is not reduced below the 
specified minimum wall thickness. Machining or grinding shall 
follow inspection of the pipe as rolled, and shall be followed by 
supplementary visual inspection. 
9.3 Repair of Plate Defects by Welding-It is permitted to 
repair by welding defects that violate minimum wall thickness, 
but only with the approval of the purchaser. Areas shall be 
suitably prepared for welding with tightly closed defects 
removed by grinding. Open, clean defects, such as pits or 
impressions, may require no preparation. All welders, welding 
operators, and weld procedures shall be qualified to the ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX. Unless the 
purchaser specifies otherwise, pipe required to be heat treated 
under the provisions of 6.3, shall be heat treated or reheat 
treated following repair welding. Repaired lengths, where 
repair depth is greater than ¼ of the thickness, shall be pressure 
tested or repressure tested after repair and heat treatment (if 
any). Repair welds shall also be examined by suitable non­
destmctive examination techniques, including any techniques 
specifically required of the primary weld. 
9 .4 The pipe shall be free of scale and contaminating iron 
particles. Pickling, blasting, or surface finishing is not manda­
tory when pipe is bright annealed. The purchaser is permitted 
to request that a passivating treatment be applied. 
10. Heat Analysis 
10.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the 
plate manufacturer to determine the percentages of the ele­
ments prescribed in Specification A240/A240M. The chemical 
composition thus determined shall confonn to the requirements 
prescribed in Specification A240/A240M. 
11. Product Analysis 
11.1 For each lot of 500 ft [150 m] of pipe or fraction 
thereof, analysis shall be made by the manufacturer from the 
finished pipe of the plate and of the weld deposit. Dtillings for 
analysis may be taken from the mechanical test specimens. The 
results of these analyses shall be reported to the purchaser or 
the purchaser's representative, and shall conform to the re­
quirements of Section 7, subject to the product analysis 
tolerances of Table 1 in Specification A480/ A480M. 
11.2 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 9.1 does 
not conform to the requirements specified in Section 7, 
analyses shall be made on additional pipe of double the original 
number from the same lot, each of which shall conform to the 
requirements specified. 
12. Tensile Requirements 
12.1 The plate used in making the pipe shall conform to the 
requirements as to tensile properties of the applicable specifi­
cations listed in Table 1. Tension tests made by the plate 
manufacturer shall qualify the plate material. 
12.2 The transverse tension test taken across the welded 
joint specimen shall have a tensile strength not less than the 
specified minimum tensile strength of the plate. 
13. Transverse Guided-Bend Weld Tests 
13.1 Two bend test specimens shall be taken transversely 
from the pipe. Except as provided in 13.2, one shall be subject 
to a face guided-bend test and the second to a root guided-bend 
test. One specimen shall be bent with the inside smface of the 
pipe against the plunger, and the other with the outside surface 
against the plunger. 
13.2 For wall thicknesses over 3/s in. [9.5 mm] but less than 
¾ in. [19 mm] side-bend tests may be made instead of the face 
and root-bend tests. For specified wall thicknesses ¾ in. [19 
mm] and over, both specimens shall be subjected to the 
side-bend tests. Side-bend specimens shall be bent so that one 
of the side surfaces becomes the convex surface of the bend 
specimen. 
13.3 The bend test shall be acceptable if no cracks or other 
defects exceeding 1h in. [3 mm] in any direction is present in 
the weld metal or between the weld and the pipe metal after 
bending. Cracks that originate along the edges of the specimen 
during testing, and that are less than¼ in. [6.5 mm] measured 
in any direction shall not be considered. 
14. Test Specimens and Methods of Testing 
14.1 Transverse tension and bend test specimens shall be 
taken from the end of the finished pipe; the transverse tension 
and bend test specimens shall be flattened cold before final 
machining to size. 
14.2 As an alternative to the requirements of 14.1, it is 
permitted to take the test specimens from a test plate of the 
same material as the pipe that is attached to the end of the 
cylinder and welded as a prolongation of the pipe longitudinal 
seam. 
14.3 Tension test specimens shall be made in accordance 
with Section IX, Part QW, Paragraph QW-150 of the ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and shall be one of the types 
shown in QW-462.1 of that code. 
14.3.1 Reduced-section specimens conforming to the re­
quirements given in QW-462.1 (b) may be used for tension tests 
on all thicknesses of pipe having outside diameter greater than 
3 in. [76 mm]. 
14.3.2 Turned specimens conforming to the requirements of 
QW-462.l(d) may be used for tension tests. 
571 
14.3.2.1 If turned specimens are used as given in 14.3.2.2 
and 14.3.2.3, one complete set shall be made for each required 
tension test. 
14.3.2.2 For thicknesses to and including 1 ¼ in. [32 mm], it 
is permitted to use a single turned specimen. 
14.3.2.3 For thicknesses over 1 ¼ in. [32 mm], multiple 
specimens shall be cut through the full thickness of the weld

of odginal adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscdpt epsilon (e) indicates an editodal change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers heavy-wall carbon and alloy 
steel pipe (Note 1) made from turned and bored forgings and is 
intended for high-temperature service. Pipe ordered under this 
specification shall be suitable for bending and other forming 
operations and for fusion welding. Selection will depend on 
design, service conditions, mechanical properties and high­
temperature characteristics. 
NoTE 1-The use of the word "pipe" throughout the several sections of 
this specification is used in the broad sense and intended to mean pipe 
headers, or leads. 
NoTE 2-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diameter," "size," and '"nominal size." 
1.2 Several grades of ferritic steels are covered. Their 
compositions are given in Table 1. 
1.3 Supplementary requirements (S 1 to S7) of an optional 
nature are provided. Supplementary requirements S 1 to S5 call 
for additional tests to be made, and when desired shall be so 
stated in the order, together with the number of such tests 
required as applicable. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-

4. General Requirements 
4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A999/ A999M, unless otherwise provided herein. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Discard: 
5 .1.1 A sufficient discard shall be made from each ingot to 
secure freedom from injurious defects. The steel shall have a 
homogeneous structure. 
5.2 Manufacture: 
5.2.1 Material for forging shall consist of ingots or of 
blooms, billets, or solid-rolled bars forged or rolled from an 
ingot, and cut to the required length by a process that will not 
produce injurious defects in the forging. 
5.2.2 The material shall be forged (Note 3) by hammering or 
pressing, and shall be brought as nearly as practicable to the 
finished shape and size by hot working. 
NoTE 3-The cross-sectional area of the solid forging shall have a 
reduction by forging or by rolling and forging from that of the ingot in the 
ratio of not less than 3 to 1. 
5.2.3 Unless otherwise specified, the final forging operation 
shall be followed by a treatment suitable to the grade as 
specified in 5.4. 
5.3 Machining: 
5.3.1 All forgings shall have both the inner and outer 
surfaces machined. 
5.3.2 After heat treatment, the pipe shall be machined to a 
finish with a roughness value no greater than 250-µin. [6.4-µm] 
arithmetical average deviation (AA), terms as defined in ANSI 
B 46.1-1962, unless otherwise specified. 
5.4 Heat Treatment: 
5.4.1 All pipe of the grades shown in Table 1 other than 
FPA, FPB, FPl, FP2, FP12, FP91 Type 1 and Type 2, FP92, 
and FP115 shall be reheated and furnished in the full-annealed 
or normalized and tempered condition. If furnished in the 
normalized and tempered condition (Note 4), the temperature 
for tempering shall be 1250 °F [680 °C] or higher for Grades 
FPS, FP9, FP21, and FP22, and 1200 °F [650 °C] or higher for 
Grades FP36 and FPll. 
NoTE 4-It is recommended that the temperature for tempering should 
be at least 100 °F [50 °C] above the intended service temperature; 
consequently, the purchaser should advise the manufacturer if the service 
temperature is to be over ll00 0 P [600 °C]. 
578 
5.4.2 Pipe in Grades FPA and FPB as a final heat treatment 
shall be either normalized or shall be given a stress relieving 
treatment at 1200 to 1300 °F [650 to 705 °C]. Pipe in Grades 
FPl, FP2, and FP12, as a final heat treatment shall be given a 
stress-relieving treatment at 1200 to 1300 °F [650 to 705 °C). 
NoTE 5-Certain of the ferritic steels covered by this specification tend 
to harden if cooled rapidly from above their critical temperature. Some 
will air harden, that is, become hardened to an undesirable degree when 
cooled in air from high temperatures. Therefore, operations involving 
heating such steels above their critical temperatures, such as welding, 
hot-bending and other forming operations, should be followed by suitable 
heat treatment. 
5.4.3 Except when Supplementary Requirement S6 is speci­
fied by the purchaser, Grade FP91 Type 1 and Type 2 shall be 
normalized and tempered by reheating within the temperature 
range from 1900 to 1975 °F [1040 to 1080 °C), followed by air 
cooling and tempering in the temperature range of 1350 to 
1470 °F [730 to 800 °C).

fied by the purchaser, Grade FP92 shall be normalized and 
tempered by reheating within the temperature range of 1900 to 
1975 °F [1040 to 1080 °C], followed by air cooling and 
tempering in the temperature range of 1350 to 1470 °F [730 to 
800 °C]. 
5.4.5 Grade FP115 shall be nonnalized and tempered by 
reheating within the temperature range of 1920 to 2010 °F 
[1050 to 1100 °C] and tempered in the range of 1380 to 1455 
°F [750 to 790 °C]. The rate of cooling at mid thickness from 
1650 to 900 °F [900 to 482 °C] shall be no slower than 9

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the 
purchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided 
in the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, 
retest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. 
Sl. Additional Tension Test 
S 1. 1 An additional tension test shall be made on a specimen 
from one or each end of each pipe. If this supplementary 
requirement is specified, the number of tests per pipe required 
shall be specified. If a specimen from any length fails to meet 
the required tensile properties (tensile, yield, and elongation), 
that length shall be rejected subject to retreatment in accor­
dance with Specification A999/ A999M and satisfactory retest. 
S2. Additional Flattening or Bend Tests 
S2. l The appropriate flattening or bend test may be made on 
specimens from both ends of each length of pipe. Crop ends 
may be used. If the specimen from either end of any length 
fails to conform to the specific requirement, that length shall be 
rejected. 
S3. Ultrasonic Tests 
S3.1 Each pipe shall be ultrasonically tested to determine its 
soundness throughout the entire length of the pipe. Until 
suitable standards are established, the basis for rejection of 
material shall be a matter of agreement between the manufac­
turer and purchaser. 
S4. Hydrostatic Test 
S4.1 A hydrostatic pressure test shall be applied as agreed 
upon by the manufacturer and purchaser. 
SS. Metal Structure and Etching Tests 
S5.l The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching 
tests conducted in accordance with the appropriate portions of 
Method E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section 
from one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound 
and reasonably uniform material free of injurious laminations, 
cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this supplementary 
requirement is specified, the number of tests per pipe required 
shall also be specified. If a specimen from any length shows 
objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, subject to 
removal of the defective end and subsequent retests indicating 
the remainder of the length to be sound and reasonably uniform 
material. 
S6. Alternative Heat Treatment-Grades FP91 Type 1 
and Type 2 and FP92 
S6.1 Grades FP91 Type 1 and Type 2 and FP92 shall be 
normalized in accordance with 5.4.3 or 5.4.4, respectively, and 
tempered at a temperature, to be specified by the purchaser, 
less than 1350 °F [730 °C]. It shall be the purchaser's 
responsibility to subsequently temper in the range of 1350 to 
1470 °F [730 to 800 °C]. All mechanical tests shall be made on 
material heat treated in accordance with 5.4.3 or 5.4.4, respec­
tively. The certification shall reference this supplementary 
requirement indicating the tempering temperature applied. The 
notation "S6'' shall be included with the required marking of 
the pipe. 
S7. Minimum Cooling Rate for Grade P91 Type 2 
S7.1 For Grade P91 Type 2 material, the heat treatment shall 
ensure that following austenitizing the rate of cooling from 
1650 °F to 900 °F [900 °C to 480 °C] is no slower than 9 
°F/min [5 °C/ min].

Resolved Notes (AI-verified)
NOTE 1 (page 618)
NoTE 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diaineter," "size," and "n01ninal size." 
1.2 This specification covers the grades of alloy and stain­
less steel listed in Table 1. The selection of the proper grade 
and requirements for heat treatment shall be at the discretion of 
the purchaser, dependent on the service conditions to be 
encountered. 
1.3 Five classes of pipe are covered as follows: 
1.3.l Class I-Pipe shall be double welded by processes 
employing filler metal in all passes and shall be completely 
radio graphed. 
1.3.2 Class 2-Pipe shall be double welded by processes 
employing filler metal in all passes. No radiography is re­
quired. 
1.3.3 Class 3-Pipe shall be single welded by processes 
employing filler metal in all passes and shall be completely 
radiographed. 
1.3.4 Class 4-Same as Class 3 except that the weld pass 
exposed to the inside pipe surface may be made without the 
addition of filler metal (see 6.2.2.1 and 6.2.2.2). 
l.3.5 Class 5-Pipe shall be double welded by processes 
employing filler metal in all passes and shall be spot radio­
graphed. 
1.4 Supplementary requirements covering provisions rang­
ing from additional testing to formalized procedures for 
566 
manufacturing practice are provided. Supplementary Require­
ments S 1 through S6 are included as options to be specified 
when desired. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in nonconformance with the 
specification. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
