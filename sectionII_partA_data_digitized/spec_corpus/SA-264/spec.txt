SPECIFICATION REMOVAL 
From time to time, it becomes necessary to remove specifications from this Part of Section II. This occurs because the 
sponsoring society (e.g., ASTM, AWS, CEN) has notified ASME that the specification has either been replaced with an­
other specification, or that there is no known use and production of a material. Removal of a specification from this Sec­
tion also results in concurrent removal of the same specification from Section IX and from all of the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Construction Codes that reference the material. This action effectively prohibits further use of the ma­
terial in ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel construction. 
The following specifications will be dropped from this Section in the next Edition, unless information concerning cur­
rent production and use of the material is received before December 1 of this year: 
SF-568M 
If you are currently using and purchasing new material to this specification for ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code 
construction, and if discontinuance of this specification would present a hardship, please notify the Secretary of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee, at the address shown below: 
Secretary 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
In this 2025 edition, the ''.ASTM Personnel" page has been deleted from the front matter. In addition, specifications ori­
ginating with ASTM that are new or revised in this 2025 edition are formatted differently than those retained from the 
2023 and earlier editions. The document following the cover sheet of each new or revised specification is the unedited 
ASTM specification. The ASME title for the specification and any ASME-approved exceptions to the ASTM specification 
are shown only on the cover sheet. Specifications affected by the new format are listed in the Summary of Changes. 
Changes listed below are identified on the pages by a margin note, (25), placed next to the affected area.

CROSS-REFERENCING IN THE ASME BPVC 
Paragraphs within the ASME BPVC may include subparagraph breakdowns, i.e., nested lists. The following is a guide to 
the designation and cross-referencing of subparagraph breakdowns: 
( a) Hierarchy of Subparagraph Breakdowns 
(1) First-level breakdowns are designated as (a), (b), (c), etc. 
(2) Second-level breakdowns are designated as (1), (2), (3), etc. 
(3) Third-level breakdowns are designated as (-a), (-b), (-c), etc. 
(4) Fourth-level breakdowns are designated as (-1), (-2), (-3), etc. 
(SJ Fifth-level breakdowns are designated as ( +a), ( +b), ( +c), etc. 
(6) Sixth-level breakdowns are designated as (+1), (+2), etc. 
(b) Cross-References to Subparagraph Breakdowns. Cross-references within an alphanumerically designated para­
graph ( e.g., PG-1, UIG-56.1, NCD-3223) do not include the alphanumerical designator of that paragraph. The cross­
references to subparagraph breakdowns follow the hierarchy of the designators under which the breakdown appears. 
The following examples show the format: 
(1) If X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.1(c)(1), it will be referenced as (-a). 
(2) if X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.1(c)(2), it will be referenced as (1)(-a). 
(3) If X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.1(e)(1), it will be referenced as (c)(l)(-a). 
(4) If X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.2(c)(2), it will be referenced as X.1(c)(1)(-a).

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
STATEMENT OF POLICY ON THE USE OF ASME MATERIAL (2s) 
SPECI Fl CATIONS 
The ASME material specifications in Section II, Part A or 
Section II, Part B shall be used when ordering, producing, 
and certifying materials for ASME BPV Code construction. 
The use of a specification not in Section II, Part A or Sec­
tion II, Part B is acceptable only when it is referenced in 
an approved Code Case. 
A complete list of ASME material specifications can be 
found in Mandatory Appendix II, Tables II-200-1 and II-
200-2. Since the body of ASME material specifications 
does not originate with the Section II committee, at times 
wording may be found that differs from ASME BPV Code 
requirements. This Statement of Policy outlines the Sec­
tion II committee's position on the following: 
(a) Scope. Some specifications contain statements in the 
Scope about the service temperatures for listed alloys. 
Others contain statements that restrict alloy application 
to a particular component (e.g., heat exchangers, conden­
sers). Such statements are to be viewed as guidance in the 
corresponding ASME material specification. Alloys ap­
proved for ASME BPV Code construction are restricted 
by maximum design temperatures stipulated in Section 
II, Part D, and any stipulations of the individual construc­
tion Codes. 
(b) Units. Specifications often designate one system of 
units as the standard for the specification with conver­
sions of the other being cited as for information only. 
Compliance and acceptance for the purposes of Code 
usage is not governed by this. Section II, Part D has a 
U.S. Customary volume and an SI volume for mechanical 
and physical properties of all materials approved for Code 
construction. 
(c) References. References to other material specifica­
tions within the text often carry the original title given 
to it by the parent organization. The following are two 
examples: 
(1) From 2021 Edition of Section II, Part A, SA-203 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice ~ The steel shall be killed and shall conform 
to the fine grain size requirement of Specification A20/A20M. 
1 
(2) From 2021 Edition of Section II, Part B, SB-98/ 
SB-98M 
9.1 Refer to the appropriate paragraphs in Specification B249/B249M 
with particular reference to the following tables. 
Such references shall be interpreted as referring to the 
corresponding ASME material specification. If no corre­
sponding ASME specification exists, then the user is 
bound to the latest edition of the cited specification. 
(d} Ordering Information. The Ordering Information 
section of some specifications state that furnishing test 
reports and certification is optional. This is not valid for 
ASME BPVC. When alloys are purchased for use in ASME 
construction, test reports and certifications shall be furn­
ished to the purchaser. 
(e] Listed Alloys. To be used for Code construction, any 
alloy listed in a specification shall also have allowable 
stress values or mechanical property values, as appropri­
ate, in the ASME BPV Code. Though exceptions exist, these 
values are typically found in Section II, Part D or a Code 
Case for most Code-approved materials. 
(fJ Table Notes. Table notes are mandatory. 
(g) Main Body Notes. Notes within the main body of the 
text are for information only. 
(h) Terminology. If a specification contains a term that 
has not been defined in the ASME BPV Code, then it is ac­
ceptable to refer to the term's definition set forth by the 
corresponding standard's organization (see Mandatory 
Appendix II, II-200 for information on how to identify 
the organization). 
Material produced to an acceptable material specifica­
tion is not limited to country of origin. Before the material 
is ordered, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure 
that the intended construction Code permits materials 
certified to the desired specification. 
With the exception of ASTM International, ASME has 
not entered into copyright agreements with publishers 
of material specifications. Limits on usage appear on the 
specification's cover sheets. For sources from which an of­
ficial English-language version of a specification can be 
purchased, see Nonmandatory Appendix A.

1.2 Annex Al lists permitted variations in dimensions and 
mass (Note 1) in SI units. The values listed are not exact 
conversions of the values in Tables 1 to 31 inclusive but are, 
instead, rounded or rationalized values. Conformance to Annex 
Al is mandatory when the "M" specification designation is 
used. 
Norn 1-The term "weight" is used when inch-pound units are the 
standard; however, under SI, the preferred term is "mass." 
1.3 Annex A2 lists the dimensions of some shape profiles. 
1.4 Appendix Xl providesjnformation on coil as a source 
of structural products. 
1.5 Appendix X2 provides information on the variability of 
tensile properties in plates and structural shapes. 
1.6 Appendix X3 provides information on weldability. 
1.7 Appendix X4 provides information on cold bending of 
plates, including suggested minimum inside radii for cold 
bending. 
1.8 This general requirements specification also covers a 
group of supplementary requirements that are applicable to 
several of the above product specifications as indicated therein. 
Such requirements are provided for use where additional 
testing or additional restrictions are required by the purchaser, 
and apply only where specified individually in the purchase 
order.

1.9 In case of any conflict in requirements, the requirements 
of the applicable product specification prevail over those of this 
general requirements specification. 
1.10 Additional requirements that are specified in the pur­
chase order and accepted by the supplier are permitted, 
provided that such requirements do not negate any of the 
requirements of this general requirements specification or the 
applicable product specification. 
1.11 For purposes of determining conformance with this 
general requirements specification and the applicable product 
specification, values are to be rounded to the nearest unit in the 
right-hand place of figures used in expressing the limiting 
values in accordance with the rounding method of Practice 
E29. 
1.12 The text of this general requirements specification 
contains notes or footnotes, or both, that provide explanatory 
material. Such notes and footnotes, excluding those in tables 
and figures, do not contain any mandatory requirements. 
1.13 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with this 
specification. 
1.14 This general requirements specification and the appli­
cable product specification are expressed in both inch-pound 
units and SI units; however, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the struc­
tural product is furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.15 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.16 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 Plates (other than floor plates)-Flat, hot-rolled steel, 
ordered to thickness or weight [mass] and typically width and 
length, commonly classified as follows: 
3.1.1.1 When Ordered to Thickness: 
(1) Over 8 in. [200 mm] in width and 0.230 in. [6 mm] or 
over in thickness. 
(2) Over 48 in. [1200 mm] in width and 0.180 in. [4.5 mm] 
or over in thickness. 
3.1.1.2 When Ordered to Weight [Mass]: 
(1) Over 8 in. [200 mm] in width and 9.392 lb/ft 2 [47.10 
kg/m 2 ] or heavier. 
(2) Over 48 in. [1200 mm] in width and 7.350 lb/ft 2 [35.32 
kg/2n 2 ] or heavier. 
3.1.1.3 Discussion-Steel products are available in various 
thickness, width, and length combinations depending upon 
equipment and processing capabilities of various manufactur­
ers and processors. Historic limitations of a product based upon

=== Page 58 ===

SA-6/SA-6M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
dimensions (thickness, width, and length) do not take into 
account current production and processing capabilities. To 
qualify any product to a particular product specification re­
quires all appropriate and necessary tests be performed and that 
the results meet the limits prescribed in that product specifi­
cation. If the necessary tests required by a product specification 
cannot be conducted, the product cannot be qualified to that 
specification. This general requirement standard contains per­
mitted variations for the commonly available sizes. Permitted 
variations for other sizes are subject to agreement between the 
customer and the manufacturer or processor, whichever is 
applicable. 
3.1.1.4 Slabs, sheet bars, and skelp, though frequently 
falling in the foregoing size ranges, are not classed as plates. 
3.1.1.5 Coils are excluded from qualification to the appli­
cable product specification until they are decoiled, leveled or 
straightened, formed (if applicable), cut to length, and, if 
required, properly tested by the processor in accordance with 
ASTM specification requirements (see Sections 9-15, 18, and 
19 and the applicable product specification). 
3.1.2 Shapes (Flanged Sections): 
3.1.2.1 structural-size shapes-rolled :flanged sections hav­
ing at least one dimension of the cross section 3 in. [75 mm] or 
greater. 
3.1.2.2 bar-size shapes-rolled flanged sections having a 
maximum dimension of the cross section less than 3 in. [75 
mm]. 
3.1.2.3 "W" shapes-doubly-symmetric, wide-flange 
shapes with inside flange surfaces that are substantially paral­
lel. 
3.1.2.4 "HP" shapes-are wide-flange shapes generally 
used as bearing piles whose flanges and webs are of the same 
nominal thickness and whose depth and width are essentially 
the same. 
3.1.2.5 "S" shapes-<loubly-symmetric beam shapes with 
inside flange surfaces that have a slope of approximately 
162/3%. 
3.1.2.6 "M" shapes-doubly-symmetric shapes that cannot 
be classified as "W," "S," or "HP" shapes. 
3.1.2.7 "C" shapes-channels with inside flange surfaces 
that have a slope of approximately 16 2/3 %. 
3.1.2.8 "MC" shapes-channels that cannot be classified as 
"C" shapes. 
3.1.2.9 "L" shapes-shapes having equal-leg and unequal­
leg angles. 
3.1.3 sheet piling~rolled steel sections that are capable of 
being interlocked, forming a continuous wall when individual 
pieces are driven side by side. 
3.1.4 bars-rounds, squares, and hexagons, of all sizes; flats 
13 /64 in. (0.203 in.) and over [over 5 mm] in specified thickness, 
not over 6 in. [150 mm] in specified width; and flats 0.230 in. 
and over [over 6 mm] in specified thickness, over 6 to 8 in. 
[150 to 200 mm] inclusive, in specified width. 
3.1.5 exclusive-when used in relation to ranges, as for 
ranges of thickness in the tables of permissible variations in 
dimensions, is intended to exclude only the greater value of the 
6 
range. Thus, a range from 60 to 72 in. [1500 to 1800 mm] 
exclusive includes 60 in. [1500 mm], but does not include 72 
in. [1800 mm]. 
3.1.6 rimmed steel-steel containing sufficient oxygen to 
give a continuous evolution of carbon monoxide during 
solidification, resulting in a case or rim of metal virtually free 
of voids. 
3.1.7 semi-killed steel-incompletely deoxidized steel con­
taining sufficient oxygen to form enough carbon monoxide 
during solidification to offset solidification shrinkage. 
3.1.8 capped steel-rimmed steel in which the rimming 
action is limited by an early capping operation. Capping is 
carried out mechanically by using a heavy metal cap on a 
bottle-top mold or chemically by an addition of aluminum or 
ferrosilicon to the top of the molten steel in an open-top mold. 
3.1.9 killed steel-steel deoxidized, either by addition of 
strong deoxidizing agents or by vacuum treatment, to reduce 
the oxygen content to such a level that no reaction occurs 
between carbon and oxygen during solidification. 
3.1.10 mill edge-the normal edge produced by rolling 
between horizontal finishing rolls. A mill edge does not 
conform to any definite contour. Mill edge plates have two mill 
edges and two trimmed edges. 
3.1.11 universal mill edge-the normal edge produced by 
rolling between horizontal and vertical finishing rolls. Univer­
sal mill plates, sometimes designated UM Plates, have two 
universal mill edges and two trimmed edges. 
3.1.12 sheared edge-the normal edge produced by shear­
ing. Sheared edge plates are trimmed on all edges. 
3.1.13 gas cut edge-the edge produced by gas flame 
cutting. 
3.1.14 special cut edge-usually the edge produced by gas 
flame cutting involving special practices such as pre-heating or 
post-heating, or both, in order to minimize stresses, avoid 
thermal cracking and reduce the hardness of the gas cut edge. 
In special instances, special cut edge is used to designate an 
edge produced by machining. 
3.1.15 sketch-when used to describe a form of plate, 
denotes a plate other than rectangular, circular, or semi­
circular. 
3.1.16 normalizing-a heat treating process in which a steel 
plate is reheated to a uniform temperature above the upper 
critical temperature and then cooled in air to below the 
transformation range. 
3. 1. 17 plate-as-rolled-when used in relation to the location 
and number of tests, the term refers to the unit plate rolled from 
a slab or directly from an ingot. It does not refer to the 
condition of the plate. 
3 .1.18 fine grain practice-a steelmaking practice that is 
intended to produce a killed steel that is capable of meeting the 
requirements for fine austenitic grain size. 
3.1.18.1 Discussion-It normally involves the addition of 
one or more austenitic grain refining elements in amounts that 
have been established by the steel producer as being sufficient.

=== Page 59 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-6/SA-6M 
Austenitic grain refining elements include, but are not limited 
to, aluminum, columbium (niobium), titanium, and vanadium. 
3.1.19 structural product-a hot-rolled steel plate, shape, 
sheet piling, or bar. 
3.1.20 coil-hot-rolled steel in coiled form that is intended 
to be processed into a finished structural product. 
3.1.21 manufacturer-the organization that directly controls 
the conversion of steel ingots, slabs, blooms, or billets, by 
hot-rolling, into an as-rolled structural product or into coil; and 
for structural products produced from as-rolled structural 
products, the organization that directly controls, or is respon­
sible for, the operations involved in finishing the structural 
product. 
3.1.21.1 Discussion-Such finishing operations include lev­
eling or straightening, hot forming or cold forming (if 
applicable), welding (if applicable), cutting to length, testing, 
inspection, conditioning, heat treatment (if applicable), 
packaging, marking, loading for shipment, and certification. 
3.1.22 processor-the organization that directly controls, or 
is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of 
coil into a finished structural product. Such processing opera­
tions include decoiling, leveling or straightening, hot-forming 
or cold-forming (if applicable), welding (if applicable), cutting 
to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, heat treatment (if 
applicable), packaging, marking, loading for shipment, and 
certification. 
3 .1.22.1 Discussion-The processing operations need not be 
done by the organization that did the hot rolling of the coil. If 
only one organization is involved in the hot rolling and 
processing operations, that organization is termed the manu­
facturer for the hot rolling operation and the processor for the 
processing operations. If more than one organization is in­
volved in the hot rolling and processing operations, the 
organization that did the hot rolling is termed the manufacturer 
and an organization that does one or more processing opera­
tions is termed a processor. 
3.2 Refer to Terminology A941 for additional definitions of 
terms used in this standard.

5. Materials and Manufacture 
5 .1 The steel shall be made in a basic-oxygen or electric-arc 
furnace, possibly followed by additional refining in a ladle 
metallurgy furnace (LMF) or secondary melting by vacuum­
arc remelting (VAR) or electroslag remelting (ESR). 
5.2 The steel shall be killed. 
5.3 The steel shall be strand cast or cast in stationary molds. 
5.3.1 Strand Cast: 
5.3.1.1 When heats of the same nominal chemical compo­
sition are consecutively strand cast at one time, the heat 
number assigned to the cast product need not be changed until 
all of the steel in the cast product is from the following heat. 
5.3.1.2 When two consecutively strand cast heats have 
different nominal chemical composition ranges, the manufac­
turer shall remove the transition material by an established 
procedure that positively separates the grades. 
5.4 Structural products shall be produced from an as-rolled 
structural product or from coil. 
5.5 Where part of a heat is rolled into an as-rolled structural 
product and the balance of the heat is rolled into coil, each part 
shall be tested separately. 
5.6 Structural products produced from coil shall not contain 
splice welds, unless previously approved by the purchaser. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 Where the structural product is required to be heat 
treated, such heat treatment shall be performed by the 
manufacturer, the processor, or the fabricator, unless otherwise 
specified in the applicable product specification. 
NOTE 2-When no heat treatment is required, the manufacturer or 
processor has the option of heat treating the structural product by 
normalizing, stress relieving, or normalizing then stress relieving to meet 
the applicable product specification. 
6.2 Where the heat treatment is to be performed by other 
than the manufacturer, the order shall so state. 
6.2.1 Where the heat treatment is to be performed by other 
than the manufacturer, the structural products shall be accepted 
on the basis of tests made on test specimens taken from full 
thickness test coupons heat treated in accordance with the 
requirements specified in the applicable product specification 
or in the purchase order. If the heat-treatment temperatures are 
not specified, the manufacturer or processor shall heat treat the 
test coupons under conditions the manufacturer or processor

=== Page 60 ===

SA-6/SA-6M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
considers appropriate, provided that the purchaser is informed 
of the procedure followed in heat treating the test coupons. 
6.3 Where the heat treatment is to be performed by the 
manufacturer or the processor, the structural product shall be 
heat treated as specified in the applicable product specification, 
or as specified in the purchase order, provided that the heat 
treatment specified by the purchaser is not in conflict with the 
requirements of the applicable product specification. 
6.4 Where normalizing is to be performed by the fabricator, 
the structural product shall be either normalized or heated 
uniformly for hot forming, provided that the temperature to 
which the structural product is heated for hot forming does not 
significantly exceed the normalizing temperature. 
6.5 The use of cooling rates that are faster than those 
obtained by cooling in air to improve the toughness shall be 
subject to approval by the purchaser, and structural products so 
treated shall be tempered subsequently in the range from 1100 
to 1300°F [595 to 705°C]. 
7. Chemical Analysis 
7.1 Heat Analysis: 
7 .1.1 Sampling for chemical analysis and methods of analy­
sis shall be in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, and 
Terminology A751. 
7.1.2 For each heat, the heat analysis shall include determi­
nation of the content of carbon, manganese, phosphorus, sulfur, 
silicon, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, copper, vanadium, 
columbium (niobium); any other element that is specified or 
restricted by the applicable product specification for the 
applicable grade, class, and type; and any austenitic grain 
refining element whose content is to be used in place of 
austenitic grain size testing of the heat (see 8.3.2). Boron shall 
be reported if intentionally added. 
NoTE 3-For steels that do not have intentional boron additions for 
hardenability, the boron content will not normally exceed 0.0008 %. 
7.1.3 Except as allowed by 7.1.4 for primary heats, heat 
analyses shall conform to the heat analysis requirements of the 
applicable product specification for the applicable grade,· class, 
and type. 
7.1.4 Where vacuum-arc remelting or electroslag remelting 
is used, a remelted heat is defined as all ingots remelted from 
a single primary heat. If the heat analysis of the primary heat 
conforms to the heat analysis requirements of the applicable 
product specification for the applicable grade, class, and type, 
the heat analysis for the remelted heat shall be determined from 
one test sample taken from one remelted ingot, or the product 
of one remelted ingot, from the primary heat. If the heat 
analysis of the primary heat does not conform to the heat 
analysis requirements of the applicable product specification 
for the applicable grade, type, and class, the heat analysis for 
the remelted heat shall be determined from one test sample 
taken from each remelted ingot, or the product of each 
remelted ingot, from the primary heat. 
7.2 Product Analysis-For each heat, the purchaser shall 
have the option of analyzing representative samples taken from 
the finished structural product. Sampling for chemical analysis 
8 
and methods of analysis shall be in accordance with Test 
Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751. The product 
analyses so determined shall conform to the heat analysis 
requirements of the applicable product specification for the 
applicable grade, class, and type, subject to the permitted 
variations in product analysis given in Table A. If a range is 
specified, the determinations of any element in a heat shall not 
vary both above and below the specified range. Rimmed or 
capped steel is characterized by a lack of homogeneity in its 
composition, especially for the elements carbon, phosphorus, 
and sulfur. Therefore, the limitations for these elements shall 
not be applicable unless misapplication is clearly indicated. 
7 .3 Referee Analysis-For referee purposes, Test Methods, 
Practices, and Terminology A751 shall be used. 
7.4 Grade Substitution-Alloy steel grades that meet the 
chemical requirements of Table 1 of Specification A829/ 
A829M shall not be substituted for carbon steel grades. 
8. Metallurgical Structure 
8.1 Where austenitic grain size testing is required, such 
testing shall be in accordance with Test Methods E112 and at 
least 70 % of the grains in the area exaruined shall meet the 
specified grain size requirement. 
8.1.1 Discussion-Austenitic Grain Size-All requirements 
for austenitic grain size control in Section 8, Metallurgical 
Structure, refer to a size of austenite grains that form when and 
if the structural product is reheated to a temperature at or above 
the transformation temperature, Ac 3 , after the product has 
experienced the complete rolling operation and has cooled to 
ambient temperature. The requirements for austenitic grain size 
control in Section 8, including the results of the referenced 
testing methods, do not measure or control the prior austenitic 
grain size or the ferritic grain size of the structural product in 
the as-rolled condition. 
8.2 Coarse Austenitic Grain Size-Where coarse austenitic 
grain size is specified, one austenitic grain size test per heat 
shall be made and the austenitic grain size number so deter­
mined shall be in the range of 1 to 5 inclusive. 
8.3 Fine Austenitic Grain Size: 
8.3.1 Where fine austenitic grain size is specified, except as 
allowed in 8.3.2, one austenitic grain size test per heat shall be 
made and the austenitic grain size number so determined shall 
be 5 or higher. 
NoTE 4-Such austenitic grain size numbers may be achieved with 
lower contents of austenitic grain refining elements than 8.3.2 requires for 
austenitic grain size testing to be waived. 
8.3.2 Unless testing for fine austenitic grain size is specified 
in the purchase order, an austenitic grain size test need not be 
made for any heat that has, by heat analysis, one or more of the 
following: 
8.3.2.1 A total aluruinum content of 0.020 % or more. 
8.3.2.2 An acid soluble aluruinum content of 0.015 % or 
more. 
8.3.2.3 A content for an austenitic grain refining element 
that exceeds the minimum value agreed to by the purchaser as 
being sufficient for austenitic grain size testing to be waived, or

9. Quality
9.1 General—Structural products shall be free of injurious !
defects and shall have a workmanlike finish. =

SA-6/SA-6M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
NoTE 5-Unless otherwise specified, structural products are normally 
furnished in the as-rolled condition and are subjected to visual inspection 
by the manufacturer or processor. Non-injurious surface or internal 
imperfections, or both, may be present in the structural product as 
delivered and the structural product may require conditioning by the 
purchaser to improve its appearance or in preparation for welding, coating, 
or other further operations. 
More restrictive requirements may be specified by invoking supplemen­
tary requirements or by agreement between the purchaser and the supplier. 
Structural products that exhibit injurious defects during subsequent 
fabrication are deemed not to comply with the applicable product 
specification. (See 17 .2.) Fabricators should be aware that cracks may 
initiate upon bending a sheared or burned edge during the fabrication 
process; this is not considered to be a fault of the steel but is rather a 
function of the induced cold-work or the heat-affected zone. 
The conditioning requirements in 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4 limit the condition­
ing allowed to be performed by the manufacturer or processor. Condition­
ing of imperfections beyond the limits of 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4 may be 
performed by parties other than the manufacturer or processor at the 
discretion of the purchaser. 
9.2 Plate Conditioning: 
9.2.1 The grinding of plates by the manufacturer or proces­
sor to remove imperfections on the top or bottom surface shall 
be subject to the limitations that the area ground is well faired 
without abrupt changes in contour and the grinding does not 
reduce the thickness of the plate by (J) more than 7 % under 
the nominal thickness for plates ordered to weight per square 
foot or mass per square metre, but in no case more than 1/s in. 
[3 mm]; or (2) below the permissible minimum thickness for 
plates ordered to thickness in inches or millimetres. 
9.2.2 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) following the 
removal of imperfections on the top or bottom surface of plates 
by chipping, grinding, or arc-air gouging shall be subject to the 
following limiting conditions: 
9.2.2.l The chipped, ground, or gouged area shall not 
exceed 2 % of the area of the surface being conditioned. 
9.2.2.2 After removal of any imperfections preparatory to 
welding, the thickness of the plate at any location shall not be 
reduced by more than 30 % of the nominal thickness of the 
plate. (Specification A131/A131M restricts the reduction in 
thickness to 20 % maximum.) 
9.2.3 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) following the 
removal of injurious imperfections on the edges of plates by 
grinding, chipping, or arc-air gouging by the manufacturer or 
processor shall be subject to the limitation that, prior to 
welding, the depth of the depression, measured from the plate 
edge inward, is not more than the thickness of the plate or 1 in. 
[25 mm], whichever is the lesser. 
9.3 Structural Size Shapes, Bar Size Shapes, and Sheet 
Piling Conditioning: 
9.3.1 The grinding, or chipping and grinding, of structural 
size shapes, bar size shapes, and sheet piling by the manufac­
turer or processor to remove imperfections shall be subject to 
the limitations that the area ground is well faired without 
abrupt changes in contour and the depression does not extend 
below the rolled surface by more than (J) 1/32 in. [1 mm], for 
material less than 3/s in. [10 mm] in thickness; (2) 1/16 in. [2 
mm], for material 3fs to 2 in. [10 to 50 mm] inclusive in 
thickness; or (3) 1/s in. [3 mm], for material over 2 in. [50 mm] 
in thickness. 
9.3.2 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) following 
removal of imperfections that are greater in depth than the 
limits listed in 9.3.1 shall be subject to the following limiting 
conditions: 
9.3.2.1 The total area of the chipped or ground surface of 
any piece prior to welding shall not exceed 2 % of the total 
surface area of that piece. 
9.3.2.2 The reduction of thickness of the material resulting 
from removal of imperfections prior to welding shall not 
exceed 30 % of the nominal thickness at the location of the 
imperfection, nor shall the depth of depression prior to welding 
exceed 1 ¼ in. [32 mm] in any case except as noted in 9.3.2.3. 
9.3.2.3 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) following 
grinding, chipping, or arc-air gouging of the toes of angles, 
beams, channels, and zees and the stems and toes of tees shall 
be subject to the limitation that, prior to welding, the depth of 
the depression, measured from the toe inward, is not more than 
the thickness of the material at the base of the depression or ½ 
in. [12.5 mm], whichever is the lesser. 
9.3.2.4 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) and grinding 
to correct or build up the interlock of any sheet piling section 
at any location shall be subject to the limitation that the total 
surface area of the weld not exceed 2 % of the total surface 
area of the piece. 
9.4 Bar Conditioning: 
9.4.1 The conditioning of bars by the manufacturer or 
processor to remove imperfections by grinding, chipping, or 
some other means shall be subject to the limitations that the 
conditioned area is well faired and the affected sectional area'is 
not reduced by more than the applicable permitted variations 
.. (see Section 12). 
10 
9.4.2 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) following 
chipping or grinding to remove imperfections that are greater 
in depth than the limits listed in 9.4.1 shall be subject to the 
following conditions: 
9.4.2.1 The total area of the chipped or ground surface of 
any piece, prior to welding, shall not exceed 2 % of the total 
surface area of the piece. 
9.4.2.2 The reduction of sectional dimension of a round, 
square, or hexagon bar, or the reduction in thickness of a flat 
bar, resulting from removal of an imperfection, prior to 
welding, shall not exceed 5 % of the nominal dimension or 
thickness at the location of the imperfection. 
9.4.2.3 For the edges of flat bars, the depth of the condi­
tioning depression prior to welding shall be measured from the 
edge inward and shall be limited to a maximum depth equal to 
the thickness of the flat bar or ½ in. [12.5 mm], whichever is 
less. 
9.5 Repair by Welding:

=== Page 63 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-6/SA-6M 
A5.20/A5.20M, A5.23/A5.23M, A5.28/A5.28M, or A5.29/ 
A5.29M, whichever is applicable. For SMAW, low hydrogen 
electrodes shall be used. 
9.5.1.3 Electrodes and electrode-flux combinations shall be 
selected so that the tensile strength of the deposited weld metal 
(after any required heat treatment) is consistent with the tensile 
strength specified for the base metal being repaired. 
9.5.1.4 Welding electrodes and flux materials shall be dry 
and protected from moisture during storage and use. 
9.5.1.5 Prior to repair welding, the surface to be welded 
shall be inspected to verify that the imperfections intended to 
be removed have been removed completely. Surfaces to be 
welded and smiaces adjacent to the weld shall be dry and free 
of scale, slag, mst, moisture, grease, and other foreign material 
that would prevent proper welding. 
9.5.1.6 Welders and welding operators shall be qualified in 
accordance with the requirements of AWS Dl.1/Dl.lM or 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX, except 
that any complete joint penetration groove weld qualification 
also qualifies the welder or welding operator to do repair 
welding. 
9.5.1.7 Repair welding of structural products shall be in 
accordance with a welding procedure specification (WPS) that 
is in accordance with the requirements of AWS Dl.1/Dl.lM or 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX, with the 
following exceptions or clarifications: 
( 1) The WPS shall be qualified by testing a complete joint 
penetration groove weld or a surface groove weld. 
(2) The geometry of the surface groove weld need not be 
described in other than a general way. 
(3) An AWS Dl.1/Dl.lM prequalified complete joint 
penetration groove weld WPS is acceptable. 
( 4) Any material not listed in the prequalified base 
metal-filler metal combinations of AWS Dl.1/Dl.lM also is 
considered to be prequalified if its chemical composition and 
mechanical properties are comparable to those for one of the 
prequalified base metals listed in AWS Dl.1/Dl.lM. 
9.5.1.8 When so specified in the purchase order, the WPS 
shall include qualification by Charpy V-notch testing, with the 
test locations, test conditions, and the acceptance criteria 
meeting the requirements specified for repair welding in the 
purchase order. 
9.5.1.9 When so specified in the purchase order, the welding 
procedure specification shall be subject to approval by the 
purchaser prior to repair welding. 
9.5.2 Structural Products with a Specified Minimum Tensile 
Strength of 100 ksi [690 MPa] or Higher-Repair welding of 
structural products with a specified minimum tensile strength 
of 100 ksi [690 MPa] or higher shall be subject to the following 
additional requirements: 
9.5.2.1 When so specified in the purchase order, prior 
approval for repair by welding shall be obtained from the 
purchaser. 
9.5.2.2 The surface to be welded shall be inspected using a 
magnetic particle method or a liquid penetrant method to verify 
that the imperfections intended to be removed have been 
completely removed. When magnetic particle inspection is 
11 
employed, the surface shall be inspected both parallel and 
perpendicular to the length of the area to be repaired. 
9.5.2.3 When weld repairs are to be post-weld heat-treated, 
special care shall be exercised in the selection of electrodes to 
avoid those compositions that embrittle as a result of such heat 
treatment. 
9.5.2.4 Repairs on structural products that are subsequently 
heat-treated at the mill shall be inspected after heat treatment; 
repairs on structural products that are not subsequently heat­
treated at the mill shall be inspected no sooner than 48 h after 
welding. Such inspection shall use a magnetic particle method 
or a liquid penetrant method; where magnetic particle inspec­
tion is involved, such inspection shall be both parallel to and 
perpendicular to the length of the repair. 
9.5.2.5 The location of the weld repairs shall be marked on 
the finished piece. • 
9.5.3 Repair Quality-The welds and adjacent heat-affected 
zone shall be sound and free of cracks, the weld metal being 
thoroughly fused to all surfaces and edges without undercutting 
or overlap. Any visible cracks, porosity, lack of fusion, or 
undercut in any layer shall be removed prior to deposition of 
the succeeding layer. Weld metal shall project at least 1/J6 in. (2 
mm) above the rolled surface after welding, and the projecting 
metal shall be removed by chipping or grinding, or both, to 
make it flush with the rolled smiace, and to produce a 
workmanlike finish. 
9.5.4 Inspection of Repair-The manufacturer or processor 
shall maintain an inspection program to inspect the work to see 
that: 
9.5.4.1 Imperfections have been completely removed. 
9.5.4.2 The limitations specified above have not been ex­
ceeded.

Methods and Definitions A370. 
10.2 Yield strength shall be determined either by the 0.2 % 
offset method or by the 0.5 % extension under load method, 
unless otherwise stated in the material specification. 
10.3 Rounding Procedures-For purposes of determining 
conformance with the specification, a calculated value shall be 
rounded to the nearest 1 ksi [5 MPa] tensile and yield strength, 
and to the nearest unit in the right-hand place of figures used in 
expressing the limiting value for other values in accordance 
with the rounding method given in Practice E29. 
10.4 For full-section test specimens of angles, the cross­
sectional area used for calculating the yield and tensile 
strengths shall be a theoretical area calculated on the basis of 
the weight of the test specimen (see 12.1).

11.5.3.4 For bars other than those to be used for pins and 
rollers, the manufacturer or processor shall have the option of 
using test specimens that are machined to a thickness or 
diameter of at least ¾ in. [20 mm] for a length of at least 9 in. 
[230 mm]. 
11.5.3.5 Test specimens for bars to be used for pins and 
rollers shall conform to the requirements shown in Fig. 4 of 
Test Methods and Definitions A370 for the 0.500-in. [12.5-
mm] diameter test specimen. 
11.6 Elongation Requirement Adjustments: 
11.6.1 Due to the specimen geometry effect encountered 
when using the rectangular tension test specimen for testing 
thin material, adjustments in elongation requirements must be 
provided for thicknesses under 0.312 in. [8 mm]. Accordingly, 
the following deductions from the base elongation require­
ments shall apply: 
Nominal Thickness Range, 
in.(mm] 
0.299-0.311 (7.60-7.89] 
0.286-0.298 (7.30-7.59] 
0.273-0.285 (7.00-7.29] 
0.259-0.272 (6.60-6.99] 
0.246-0.258 (6.20-6.59] 
0.233-0.245 (5.90-6.19] 
0.219-0.232 [5.50-5.89] 
0.206-0.218 (5.20-5.49] 
0.193-0.205 [4.90-5.19] 
0.180-0.192 [4.60-4.89] 
0.166-0.179 [4.20-4.59] 
0.153-0.165 [3.90-4.19] 
0.140-0.152 [3.60-3.89]

A Elongation deductions for thicknesses less than 0.180 in. [4.60 mm] apply to 
plates and structural shapes only. 
11.6.2 Due to the specimen geometry effect encountered 
when using full-section test specimens for angles, the elonga­
tion requirements for structural-size angles shall be increased 
by six percentage points when full-section test specimens are 
used. 
11.6.3 Due to the inherently lower elongation that is obtain­
able in thicker structural products, adjustments in elongation 
requirements shall be provided. For structural products over 
3.5 in. [90 mm] in thickness, a deduction of 0.5 percentage 
point from the specified percentage of elongation in 2 in. [50 
mm] shall be made for each 0.5-in. [12.5-rnm] increment of 
thickness over 3.5 in. [90 mm], up to a maximum deduction of 
3.0 percentage points. Accordingly, the following deductions 
from the base elongation requirements shall apply: 
Nominal Thickness Range, Elongation 
in. [mm] Deduction, % 
3.600-3.999 [90.00-102.49] 0.6 
4.000-4.499 [102.50-114.99] 1.0

6.500-5.999 (140.00-152.49] 2.5 
6.000 and thicker [152.50 and thicker] 3.0 
11.6.4 The tensile property requirements tables in many of 
the product specifications covered by this general requirements 
specification specify elongation requirements in both 8-in. 
[200-mm] and 2-in. [50-mm] gage lengths. Unless otherwise 
14 
provided in the applicable product specification, both require­
ments are not required to be applied simultaneously and the 
elongation need only be determined in the gage length appro­
priate for the test specimen used. After selection of the 
appropriate gage length, the elongation requirement for the 
alternative gage length shall be deemed not applicable. 
11.7 Yield Strength Application: 
11.7.1 When test specimens do not exhibit a well-defined 
disproportionate yield point, yield strength shall be determined 
and substituted for yield point. 
11.7.2 The manufacturer or processor shall have the option 
of substituting yield strength for yield point if the test specimen 
exhibits a well-defined disproportionate yield point. 
11. 7.3 Yield strength shall be determined either by the 
0.2 % offset method or by the 0.5 % extension-under-load 
method. 
11.8 Product Tension Tests-This specification does not 
provide requirements for product tension testing subsequent to 
shipment (see 15.1). Therefore, the requirements of 11.1-11.7 
inclusive and Section 13 apply only for tests conducted at the 
place of manufacture prior to shipment. 
Norn 6-Compliance to this specification and the applicable product 
specification by a manufacturer or processor does not preclude the 
possibility that product tension test results might vary outside specified 
ranges. The tensile properties will vary within the same heat or piece, be 
it as-rolled, control-rolled, or heat-treated. Tension testing according to the 
requirements of this specification does not provide assurance that all 
products of a heat will be identical in tensile properties with the products 
tested. If the purchaser wishes to have more confidence than that provided 
by this specification testing procedures, additional testing or requirements, 
such as Supplementary Requirement S4, should be imposed. 
11.8.1 Appendix X2 provides additional information on the 
variability of tensile properties in plates and structural shapes 
12. Permitted Variations in Dimensions and Weight 
[Mass] 
12.1 One cubic foot of rolled steel is assumed to weigh 490 
lb. One cubic metre of rolled steel is assumed to have a mass 
of 7850 kg. 
12.2 Plates-The permitted variations for dimensions and 
weight [mass] shall not exceed the applicable limits in Tables 1 
to 15 [Annex Al, Tables Al.1 to Al.15] inclusive. 
12.3 Shapes: 
12.3.1 Annex A2 lists the designations and dimensions, in 
both inch-pound and SI units, of shapes that are most com­
monly available. Radii of fillets and toes of shape profiles vary 
with individual manufacturers and therefore are not specified. 
12.3.2 The permitted variations in dimensions shall not 
exceed the applicable limits in Tables 16 to 25 [Annex Al, 
Tables Al.16 to Al.25] inclusive. Permitted variations for 
special shapes not listed in such tables shall be as agreed upon 
between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
Norn 7-Permitted variations are given in Tables 16 to 25 [Annex Al, 
Tables Al.16 to Al.25] inclusive for some shapes that are not listed in 
Annex A2 (that is, bulb angles, tees, zees). Addition of such sections to 
Annex A2 will be considered by Subcommittee A0l.02 when and if a need 
for such listing is shown.

12.3.3 Shapes Having One Dimension of the Cross Section 
3 in. [75 mm] or Greater (Structural-Size Shapes)-The 
cross-sectional area or weight [mass] of each shape shall be 
within ±2.5 % of the theoretical or specified amounts except 
for shapes with a nominal weight of less than 100 lb/ft [149 
kg/m], in which the variation shall be within -2.5 % to +3.0 % 
of the theoretical cross-sectional area or the specified nominal 
weight [mass]. 
12.4 Sheet Piling-The weight [mass] of each steel sheet 
pile shall be within ±2.5 % of the theoretical or specified 
weight [mass]. The length of each steel sheet pile shall be not 
less than the specified length, and not more than 5 in. [125 mm] 
over the specified length. 
12.5 Hot-Rolled Bars-The permitted variations in dimen­
sions shall not exceed the applicable limits in Tables 26 to 31 
[Annex Al, Tables Al.26 to Al.31] inclusive. 
12.6 Conversion of Permitted Variations from Fractions of 
an Inch to Decimals-Permitted variations in dimensions for 
products covered by this specification are generally given as 
fractions of an inch and these remain the official permitted 
variations, where so stated. If the material is to be measured by 
equipment reporting dimensions as decimals, conversion of 
permitted variations froni fractions of an inch to decimals shall 
be made to three decimal places; using the rounding method 
prescribed in Practice E29. 
13. Retests 
13.1 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws, the manufacturer or processor shall have the 
option of discarding it and substituting another test specimen. 
13.2 If the percentage of elongation of any tension test 
specimen is less than that specified and any part of the fracture 
is more than ¾ in. [20 mm] from the center of the gage length 
of a 2-in. [50-mm] specimen or is outside the middle half of the 
gage length of an 8-in. [200-mm] specimen, as indicated by 
scribe scratches marked on the specimen before testing, a retest 
shall be allowed. 
13.3 Except as provided in 13.3.1, if the results from an 
original tension specimen fails to meet the specified 
requirements, but are within 2 ksi [14 MPa] of the required 
tensile strength, within 1 ksi [7 MPa] of the required yield 
strength or yield point, or within 2 percentage points of the 
required elongation, a retest shall be permitted to replace the 
failing test. A retest shall be performed for the failing original 
test, with the specimen being randomly selected from the heat. 
If the results of the retest meet the specified requirements, the 
heat or lot shall be approved. 
13.3.1 For structural products that are tested as given in 
Table C, both tests from each coil tested to qualify a heat are 
required to meet all mechanical property requirements. Should 
either test fail to do so, then that coil shall not be used to 
qualify the heat; however, the portion of that individual coil 
that is bracketed by acceptable tests (see 11.4.2.3) is considered 
to be qualified. 
13.4 Quenched and tempered steel plates shall be subject to 
any additional retest requirements contained in the applicable 
product specification. 
15 
13.5 When the full-section option of 11.3.3 is used and the 
elongation falls below the specified requirement, the manufac­
turer or processor shall have the option of making another test 
using a test specimen permitted in 11.5.2. 
14. Test Reports 
14.1 Test reports for each heat supplied are required and 
they shall report the following: 
14.1.1 The applicable product specification designation, 
including year-date and whichever of grade, class, and type are 
specified in the purchase order, to which the structural product 
is furnished. 
14.1.2 The heat number, heat analysis (see 7.1), and nomi­
nal sizes. 
Norn 8-If the amount of copper, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, or 
silicon is less than 0.02 %, the heat analysis for that element may be 
reported as <0.02 %. If the amount of columbium (niobium) or vanadium 
is less than 0.008 %, the heat analysis for that element may be reported as 
<0.008 %. 
14.1.3 For structural products that are tested as given in 
Table B, two tension test results appropriate to qualify the 
shipment (see 11.4), except that only one tension test result 
need be reported if the shipment consists of a single piece or 
plate-as-rolled. 
14.1.3.1 In reporting elongation values, both the percentage 
increase and the original gage length shall be stated. 
14.1.3.2 Yield to tensile ratio when such a requirement is 
contained in the product specification. 
14.1.4 For structural products that are required to be heat 
treated, either by the applicable product specification or by the 
purchase order, all heat treatments, including temperature 
ranges and times at temperature, unless the purchaser and the 
supplier have agreed to the supply of a heat treatment proce­
dure in place of the actual temperatures and times. 
14.1.4.1 Subcritical heat treatment to soften thermally cut 
edges need not be reported, except for structural products 
having a specified minimum tensile strength of 95 ksi [655 
MPa] or higher, unless such subcritical heating is accomplished 
at temperatures at least 75°F [40°C] lower than the minimum 
tempering temperature. 
14.1.5 The results of any required austenitic grain size tests 
(see 8.2 or 8.3, whichever is applicable). 
14.1.6 The results of any other test required by the appli­
cable product specification, the applicable supplementary 
requirements, and the purchase order. 
14.2 The thickness of the structural product tested is not 
necessarily the same as an individual ordered thickness, given 
that it is the heat that is tested, rather than each ordered item. 
Tests from specified thicknesses in accordance with 11.4 and 
encompassing the thicknesses in a shipment shall be sufficient 
for qualifying the structural product in the shipment. Such test 
thicknesses are not required to be within previously tested and 
shipped thicknesses from the same heat. 
14.3 For structural products produced from coil that are 
supplied in the as-rolled condition or have been heat treated by 
stress relieving only, the test report shall state "Produced from

=== Page 68 ===

SA-6/SA-6M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Coil." Both test results shall be reported for each qualifying 
coil, and the location within the coil for each test shall be 
stated. 
14.4 For structural products produced from coil, both the 
manufacturer and the processor shall be identified on the test 
report. 
14.5 When full-section test specimens have been used for 
the qualification of angles, that information shall be stated on 
the test report. 
14.6 A signature is not required on the test report; however, 
the document shall clearly identify the organization submitting 
the report. Notwithstanding the absence of a signature, the 
organization submitting the report is responsible for the content 
of the report. 
14.7 For structural products finished by other than the 
original manufacturer, the supplier of the structural product 
shall also provide the purchaser with a copy of the original 
manufacturer's test report. 
14.8 A test report, certificate of inspection, or similar 
document printed from or used in electronic form from an 
electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission shall be re­
garded as having the same validity as a counterpart printed in 
the certifier's facility. The content of the EDI transmitted 
document shall meet the requirements of the applicable product 
specification and shall conform to any existing EDI agreement 
between the purchaser and the supplier. Notwithstanding the 
absence of a signature, the organization submitting the EDI 
transmission shall be responsible for the content of the repmt. 
NoTE 9-The industry definition as invoked here is: EDI is the 
computer to computer exchange of business information in a standard 
format such as ANSI ASC Xl2. 
15. Inspection and Testing 
15.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
free entry, at all times, while work on the contract of the 
purchaser is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's 
works that concern the manufacture of the structural product 
ordered. The manufacturer shall afford the inspector all rea­
sonable facilities to be satisfied that the structural product is 
being furnished in accordance with this general requirements 
specification, the applicable product specification, and the 
purchase order. All tests (except product analysis) and inspec­
tion shall be made at the place of manufacture prior to 
shipment, unless otherwise specified, and shall be conducted so 
as not to interfere with the operation of the manufacturer's 
works. 
15.2 Where structural products are produced from coil, 15.1 
shall apply to the processor instead of the manufacturer, and 
the place of process shall apply instead of the place of 
manufacture. Where structural products are produced from coil 
and the processor is different from the manufacturer, the 
inspector representing the purchaser shall have free entry at all 
times while work on the contract of the purchaser is being 
performed to all parts of the manufacturer's works that concern 
the manufacture of the structural product ordered. 
16 
16. Retreatment 
16.1 If any heat-treated structural product fails to meet the 
mechanical property requirements of the applicable product 
specification, the manufacturer or the processor shall have the 
option of heat treating the structural product again. All me­
chanical property tests shall be repeated and the structural 
product shall be reexamined for surface defects when it is 
resubmitted for inspection. 
17. Rejection 
17 .1 Any rejection based upon product analysis made in 
accordance with the applicable product specification shall be 
reported to the supplier and samples that represent the rejected 
structural product shall be preserved for two weeks from the 
date of notification of such rejection. In case of dissatisfaction 
with the results of the tests, the supplier shall have the option 
of making claim for a rehearing within that time. 
17.2 The purchaser shall have the option of rejecting struc­
tural product that exhibits injurious defects subsequent to its 
acceptance at the manufacturer's or processor's works, and so 
notifying the manufacturer or processor. 
18. Identification of Structural Products 
18.1 Required Plate Markings: 
18.1.1 Except as allowed by 18.1.4.2 and 18.6, plates shall 
be legibly marked with the following: applicable ASTM 
designation (see 1.1) (year-date not required); "G" or "MT" if 
applicable (see 18.1.2); applicable grade; heat number; size and 
thickness; and name, brand, or trademark of the manufacturer 
(for plates produced from an as-rolled structural product) or the 
processor (for plates produced from coil). 
18.1.2 Plates that are required to be heat treated, but have 
not been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the manufacturer 
or processor, with the letter "G" (denoting green) following the 
required ASTM designation mark, except that "G" marking is 
not necessary if such plates are for shipment, for the purpose of 
obtaining the required heat treatment, to an organization under 
the manufacturer's control. Such plates shall have been quali­
fied for shipment on the basis of test specimens that have been 
so heat treated. Plates that are required to be heat treated, and 
have been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the party that 
performed the heat treatment, with the letter "MT" (denoting 
material treated) following the required ASTM designation 
mark. 
18.1.3 Except as allowed by 18.1.4.2 and 18.6, the required 
markings for plates shall be by steel die stamping, paint 
marking, or by means of permanently affixed, colorfast, 
weather-resistant labels or tags. It shall be the responsibility of 
the supplier that all required markings be intact and fully 
legible upon receipt by the purchaser. 
18.1.4 Location of Markings: 
18.1.4.1 The required markings for plates shall be in at least 
one place on each finished plate. 
18.1.4.2 For secured lifts of all sizes of plates 3/s in. [10 mm] 
(or 5 /16 in. [8 mm] for material specified for bridge construction 
end use) or under in thickness, and for secured lifts of all 
thicknesses of plates 36 in. [900 mm] or under in width, the 
manufacturer or processor shall have the option of placing such

=== Page 69 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-6/SA-6M 
markings on only the top piece of each lift, or of showing such 
markings on a substantial tag attached to each lift, unless 
otherwise specified. 
18.2 Shapes: 
18.2.1 Except as allowed by 18.2.2 and 18.6, shapes shall be 
marked with the heat number, size of section, length, and mill 
identification marks on each piece. Shapes with the greatest 
cross-sectional dimension greater than 6 in. [150 mm] shall 
have the manufacturer's name, brand, or trademark shown in 
raised letters at intervals along the length. In addition, shapes 
shall be identified with the ASTM designation (year-date not 
required) and grade, either by marking each piece individually, 
by permanently affixing a colorfast, weather-resistant label or 
tag, or, if bundled, by attaching a substantial tag to the bundle. 
18.2.2 Bundling for shipment of small shapes with the 
greatest cross-sectional dimension not greater than 6 in. [150 
mm] is permissible. Each lift or bundle shall be marked or 
substantially tagged showing the identification information 
listed in 18.2.1. 
18.2.3 It shall be permissible for the manufacturer to make 
a full size bundle at the end of a heat by adding product from 
a consecutively rolled heat of the same nominal chemical 
composition. The manufacturer shall identify a bundle consist­
ing of product from two heats with the number of the first heat 
rolled or identify both heats. The manufacturer shall maintain 
records of the heats contained in each bundle. 
18.3 Steel Sheet Piling-Steel sheet piling shall be marked 
with the heat number, size of section, length, and mill identi­
fication marks on each piece, either by marking, or by 
permanently affixing colorfast, weather-resistant label or tag. 
The manufacturer's name, brand, or trademark shall be shown 
in raised letters at intervals along the length. 
18.4 Bars-Bars of all sizes, when loaded for shipment, 
shall be properly identified with the name or brand of 
manufacturer, purchaser's name and order number, the ASTM 
designation number (year-date not required), grade number 
where appropriate, size and length, weight [mass] of lift, and 
the heat number for identification. Unless otherwise specified, 
the method of marking is at the manufacturer's option and shall 
be made by hot stamping, cold stamping, painting, or marking 
tags attached to the lifts of bars. Bars are not required to be 
die-stamped. 
18.4.1 It shall be permissible for the manufacturer to make 
a full size bundle at the end of a heat by adding product from 
a consecutively rolled heat of the same nominal chemical 
composition. The manufacturer shall identify a bundle consist­
ing of product from two heats with the number of the first heat 
rolled or identify both heats. The manufacturer shall maintain 
records of the heats contained in each bundle. 
17 
18.5 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements of 18.1 -
18.4 inclusive, the manufacturer or processor shall have the 
option of using bar coding as a supplementary identification 
method. 
NoTE 10-Bar coding should be consistent with AIAG Standards. 
18.6 Subdivided Material: 
18.6.1 Except as allowed by 18.6.2, pieces separated from 
a master structural product by an organization other than the 
original manufacturer shall be identified with the ASTM 
designation (year-date not required), grade, heat number, and 
the heat treatment identification, if applicable, along with the 
trademark, brand, or name of the organization subdividing the 
structural product. The identification methods shall be in 
accordance with the requirements of 18.1 - 18.4 inclusive, 
except that the raised letters method for shapes and steel sheet 
piling is not required. If the original manufacturer's identifi­
cation remains intact, the structural product need not be 
additionally identified by the organization supplying the struc­
tural product. 
18.6.2 It shall be permissible for pieces from the same heat 
of structural product to be bundled or placed in secured lifts, 
with the identification specified in 18.6.1 placed on the top 
piece of each lift or shown on a substantial tag attached to each 
bundle or lift. 
19. Packaging, Marking, and Loading for Shipment 
19.1 Packaging, marking, and loading for shipment shall be 
in accordance with Practices A 700. 
19.2 When Level A is specified, and when specified in the 
contract or order, and for direct procurement by or direct 
shipment to the U.S. government, preservation, packaging, and 
packing shall be in accordance with the Level A requirements 
of MIL-STD-163. 
19.3 When specified in the contract or order, and for direct 
procurement by or direct shipment to the U.S. government, 
marking for shipment, in addition to requirements specified in 
the contract or order, shall be in accordance with MIL-STD-
129 for military agencies and with Fed. Std. No. 123 for civil 
agencies.

TABLE A1.15 Permitted Variations in Waviness for Standard 
Flatness Plates 
NoTE !-Waviness denotes the maximum deviation of the surface of 
the plate from a plane parallel to the surface of the point of measurement 
and contiguous to the surface of the place at each of the two adjacent wave 
peaks, when the plate is resting on a flat horizontal surface, as measured 
in an increment of less than 4000 mm of length. The permitted variation 
in waviness is a function of the permitted variation from a flat surface as 
obtained from Table Al.13 or Table Al.14, whichever is applicable. 
NoTE 2-Plates must be in a horizontal position on a flat surface when 
waviness is measured.

Xl. COIL AS A SOURCE OF STRUCTURAL PRODUCTS 
Xl.1 Continuous wide hot strip rolling mills are normally 
equipped with coilers. Regardless of the different types of 
systems employed during or following the rolling operations, it 
is common for the steel to be reeled into the coiler at 
temperatures in the stress-relieving range. In general, such 
temperatures are higher as the steel thickness increases. The 
coils subsequently cool to ambient temperature with outer and 
inner laps cooling more rapidly than central laps. The differ-
63 
ence in cooling rate can result in measurable differences in the 
mechanical properties throughout a coil. Data confirm reduced 
yield and tensile strength with increased percent elongation for 
the steel with slower cooling rates from the coiling temperature 
to ambient. Such differences are in addition to the effects on 
mechanical properties caused by differences in heat analysis 
and chemical segregation.

X2. l The tension testing requirements of this specification 
are intended only to characterize the tensile properties of a heat 
of steel for determination of conformance to the requirements 
of the applicable product specification. Such testing procedures 
are not intended to define the upper or lower limits of tensile 
properties at all possible test locations within a heat of steel. It 
is well known and documented that tensile properties will vary 
within a heat or individual piece of steel as a function of 
chemical composition, processing, testing procedure and other 
factors. It is, therefore, incumbent on designers and engineers 
to use sound engineering judgement when using tension test 
results shown on mill test reports. The testing procedures of 
this specification have been found to provide structural prod­
ucts adequate for normal structural design criteria. 
X2.2 A survey of the variation to be expected in tensile 
properties obtained from plates and structural shapes was 
conducted by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). 
The results of this survey are contained in a Contributions to 
the Metallurgy of Steel entitled "The Variation of Product 
Analysis and Tensile Properties-Carbon Steel Plates and 
Wide Flange Shapes" (SU/18, SU/19 and SU/20), published in 
September 197 4. The data are presented in tables of probability 
that tensile properties at other than the official location may 
differ from those of the reported test location. Another survey 
sponsored by the AISI entitled "Statistical Analysis of Struc­
tural Plate Mechanical Properties" was published in January 
2003. That survey analyzed the results of variability testing on 
more modem as-rolled steels that were generally of higher 
minimum yield strength steels and also compared those results 
statistically to the previous surveys. 
X2.3 This specification contains no requirements applicable 
to product tension tests; conformance to the applicable product 
specification is determined on the basis of tests performed at 
the place of manufacture or processing prior to shipment, 
unless otherwise specified. 
X2.4 A task group of ASTM Subcommittee A0l.02 has 
determined, based on review of the earlier AISI data, that the 
variation in tensile prope1ties of plates and structural shapes 
can be expressed as a function of specified requirements: one 
standard deviation equals approximately 4 % of required ten­
sile strength, 8 % of required yield strength, and 3 percentage 
points of required elongation. The January 2003 survey re­
sulted in similar findings. 
X2.5 Acceptance criteria for product testing based upon 
these values, either below the minimum or above the maximum 
allowed by the applicable product specification, are generally 
acceptable to manufacturers. Such tolerances could be consid­
ered by users of structural products as a reasonable basis for 
acceptance of structural products that, due to their inherent 
variability, deviate from the applicable product specification 
requirements when subjected to product tension testing. 
X3. WELDABILITY OF STEEL 
X3. l Weldability is a term that usually refers to the relative 
ease with which a metal can be welded using conventional 
practice. Difficulties arise in steel when the cooling rates 
associated with weld thermal cycles produce microstructures 
(for example, martensite) that are susceptible to brittle fracture 
or, more commonly, hydrogen-induced (or cold) cracking. 
(Solidification or hot cracking is a relatively rare phenomenon 
that will not be addressed here. See Randall for further 
information.) 
X3.2 The relative sensitivity of steels to forming cold 
cracking microstructures is called hardenability and can be 
measured in a number of ways. Perhaps the most popular 
method of assessing this is by the carbon equivalent (CE) 
formula, which attempts to equate the relative hardening 
contributions of a steel's constituent elements (for example, 
64 
manganese, vanadium) to an equivalent amount of carbon, 
which is the most significant hardening agent. The most 
popular formula is the International Institute of Welding (IIW) 
equation presented in S31.2, which has been found suitable for 
predicting hardenability in a wide range of commonly used 
carbon-manganese and low alloy steels. 
X3.3 It should be noted, however, that for the current 
generation oflow carbon ( <0.10 % ) low alloy steels that derive 
strength from a combination of microalloys and thermal 
processing methods the use of other formulae may more 
accurately assess hardenability and cold cracking sensitivity. 
X3.4 For a vast number of common structural applications it 
is unnecessary to specify the use of CE limits. However, in

=== Page 117 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-6/SA-6M 
order to obtain a higher level of confidence in avoiding cold 
cracking, the chemistry controls in S3 l are available. A 
purchaser who specifies the use of S31. should be aware that 
there are several factors involved in the judicious selection of 
a maximum CE value, such as the following: 
X3 .4.1 Actual production joint restraint/base metal 
thickness(es), 
X3.4.2 Filler metal and base metal strength compatibility, 
X3.4.3 Deposited weld metal diffusible hydrogen content, 
X3.4.4 Preheat and interpass temperatures, 
X3.4.5 Filler metal and base metal cleanliness, and 
X3.4.6 Heat input. 
X3.5 Though it is widely believed that low CE steels are 
immune to weld cracking problems, failure to consider these 
factors and others have resulted in weld or base metal HAZ 
(heat affected zone) cracks in such steels.11 
X3.6 It is important to note that carbon equivalence is only 
a qualitative assessment of potential welding problems, and 
should never be solely relied on to ensure weld integrity. The 
proper use of welding specifications, coupled with the knowl­
edge of actual construction conditions, must also be used. 
X4. RADIUS FOR COLD BENDING 
X4.1 Suggested minimum inside bend radii for cold form­
ing are referenced to Group Designations A to F inclusive as 
defined in Table X4. l. The suggested radii listed in Table X4.2 
should be used as minimums in typical shop fabrication. 
Material that does not form satisfactorily when fabricated in 
accordance with Table X4.2 may be subject to rejection 
pending negotiation with the steel supplier. When tighter bends 
are required, the manufacturer should be consulted. 
X4.2 The bend radius and the radius of the male die should 
be as liberal as the finished part will permit. The width across 
the shoulders of the female die should be at least eight times 
the plate thickness. Higher strength steels require larger die 
openings. The surface of the dies in the area of radius should 
be smooth. 
X4.2.1 Since cracks in cold bending commonly originate 
from the outside edges, shear burrs and gas cut edges should be 
removed by grinding. Sharp comers on edges and on punched 
or gas cut holes should be removed by chamfering or grinding 
to a radius. 
X4.2.2 If possible, parts should be formed such that the 
bend line is perpendicular to the direction of final rolling. If it 
is necessary to bend with the bend line parallel to the direction 
of final rolling, a more generous radius is suggested (1 ½ times 
applicable value given in Table X4.2 for bend lines perpen­
dicular to the direction of rolling).

1.5 Appendix X4 provides information on cold bending of 
plates, including suggested minimum inside radii for cold 
bending. 
1.6 These materials are intended to be suitable for fusion 
welding. When the steel is to be welded, it is presupposed that 
a welding procedure suitable for the grade of steel and intended 
use or service will be utilized. 
1.7 In case of any conflict in requirements, the requirements 
of the applicable product specification prevail over those of this 
general requirements specification. 
1.8 Additional requirements that are specified in the pur­
chase order and accepted by the supplier are permitted, 
provided that such requirements do not negate any of the 
requirements of this general requirements specification or the 
applicable product specification. 
1.9 For purposes of determining conformance with this 
general requirements specification and the applicable product 
specification, values are to be rounded to the nearest unit in the 
right-hand place of figures used in expressing the limiting 
values in accordance with the rounding method of Practice 
E29. 
1. 10 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.11 This general requirements specification and the appli­
cable product specification are expressed in both inch-pound 
units and SI units; unless the order specifies the applicable "M" 
specification designation (SI units), the plates are to be 
furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.12 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 as-rolled-for plates, the condition of a plate that has 
been hot-rolled and will not be or has not yet been heat treated. 
3.1.1.1 Discussion-The term as-rolled by itself is not 
meant to refer to plates that have been hot-rolled using control­
rolling (CR), direct quench (DQT), thermo-mechanical control 
rolling (TMCP), recrystalization control rolling (RCR), or any 
similar methods that ate intended to produce a set of properties 
that are not normally achievable were they not employed. The 
term as-rolled is to be distinguished from the established term 
70 
plate-as-rolled that does not define the actual condition of a 
plate, but defines the singular product of a slab or ingot that has 
been hot-rolled 
3.1.2 coil-hot-rolled steel in coil form for processing into 
finished plates. 
3.1.3 exclusive-when used in relation to ranges, as for 
ranges of thicknesses in the tables of permissible variations in 
dimensions, the term is intended to exclude only the greater 
value of the range. Thus, a range from 60 to 72 in. [1500 to 
1800 mm] exclusive includes 60 in. [1500 mm], but does not 
include 72 in. [1800 mm]. 
3.1.4 heat treatment terms-see 3.1.11, and Terminology 
A941. 
3.1.5 hot forming-a forming operation producing penna­
nent deformation, performed after the plate has been heated to 
the temperature required to produce grain refinement. 
3.1.6 hot-rolled (hot rolling)-for plates, the process de­
scribed for a plate that has been rolled from a slab or ingot 
whose starting temperature is suitably above the recrystalliza­
tion temperature of the metal to be rolled. 
3.1.6.1 Discussion-Hot-rolled may be used in conjunction 
with any rolling process to more effectively describe a specific 
condition, for example; hot-rolled as-rolled; hot-rolled control­
rolled, etc. 
3.1.7 manufacturer-the organization that directly controls 
the conversion of steel ingots or slabs, by hot rolling, into 
plate-as-rolled or into coil; and for plates produced from 
plate-as-rolled, the organization that directly controls, or is 
responsible for, one or more of the operations involved in 
finishing the plates. Such finishing operations include leveling, 
cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, heat treat­
ment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for shipment, 
and certification. 
3.1.7.1 Discussion-The finishing operations need not be 
done by the organization that did the hot rolling of the plate. 
For plates produced from coil, see also 3.1.2. 
3.1.8 mill edge-the normal edge produced by rolling be­
tween horizontal finishing rolls. A mill edge does not conform 
to any definite contour. Mill edge plates have two mill edges 
and two trimmed edges. 
3.1.8.1 Discussion-Mill edge plates may at times be side­
trimmed on one or both sides at the discretion of the manu­
facturer. 
3.1.9 plate identifier-the alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric 
designation used to identify the plate. 
3.1.10 plates-flat hot-rolled steel, ordered to thickness or 
weight and typically to width and length, commonly available 
by size as follows: 
Width, in. [mm] 
Over 8 [200] 
Over 48 [1200] 
Thickness, in. [mm] 
over 0.229 [6.0 mm and over] 
over 0.179 [4.6 mm and over] 
3.1.10.1 Discussion-Steel plates are available in various 
thickness, width, and length combinations dependent upon 
equipment and processing capabilities of various manufactur­
ers and processors. Historic limitations of a plate based upon 
dimensions (thickness, width, and length) do not take into

=== Page 123 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-20/SA-20M 
account current production and processing capabilities. To 
qualify any plate to a particular product specification requires 
that all appropriate and necessary tests be performed and that 
the results meet the limits prescribed in that product specifi­
cation. If the necessary tests required by a product specification 
can not be conducted, the plate can not be qualified to that 
specification. This general requirements specification contains 
permitted variations for the commonly available sizes. Permit­
ted variations for other sizes are subject to agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer or processor, whichever is 
applicable. 
3.1.11 precipitation heat treatment-a subcritical tempera­
ture thermal treatment performed to cause precipitation of 
submicroscopic constituents, and so forth, to result in enhance­
ment of some desirable property. 
3.1.12 processor-the organization that directly controls, or 
is responsible for, operations involved in the processing of coil 
into finished plates. Such processing operations include 
decoiling, leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, 
conditioning, heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, 
marking, loading for shipment, and certification. 
3.1.12.1 Discussion-The processing operations need not be 
done by the organization that did the hot rolling of the coil. If 
only one organization is involved in the hot rolling and 
processing operations, that organization is termed the manu­
facturer for the hot rolling operation and the processor for the 
processing operations. If more than one organization is in­
volved in the hot rolling and processing operations, the 
organization that did the hot rolling is termed the manufacturer 
and the organization that does one or more processing opera­
tions is termed a processor. 
3.2 Refer to Terminology A941 for additional terms used in 
this standard.

Table 1. 
7.3 Referee Analysis-For referee purposes, Test Methods, 
Practices, and Terminology A751 shall be used. 
8. Metallurgical Structure 
8.1 Where austenitic grain size testing is required, such 
testing shall be a McQuaid Ehn test in accordance with Test 
Methods El12 and at least 70 % of the grains in the area 
examined shall meet the specified grain size requirement.

grain size is specified one austenitic grain size test per heat 
shall be made and the grain size number so determined shall be 
in the range of 1 to 5 inclusive. 
8.3 Fine Austenitic Grain Size: 
8.3.1 Except as allowed in 8.3.2, and when fine austenitic 
grain size is specified, or when the producer elects to determine 
the grain size, one McQuaid Ehn test per heat shall be made 
and the austenitic grain size number so determined shall be 5 
or higher, and the chemical requirements of 8.3.2 do not apply. 
NoTE 1-Such austenitic grain size numbers may be achieved with 
lower contents of austenitic grain refining elements than 8.3.2 requires for 
austenitic grain size testing to be waived. 
8.3.2 Unless testing for fine austenitic grain size is specified 
in the purchase order or the producer elects to test for fine 
austenitic grain size, the austenitic grain size test need not be 
made for any heat that has, by heat analysis, one or more of the 
following: 
8.3.2.1 A total aluminum content of 0.020 % or more. 
8.3.2.2 An acid soluble aluminum content of 0.015 % or

8.3.2.3 A content for an austenitic grain refining element 
that exceeds the minimum value agreed to by the purchaser as 
being sufficient for austenitic grain size testing to be waived. 
8.3.2.4 Contents for the combination of two or more auste­
nitic grain refining elements that exceed the applicable mini­
mum values agreed to by the purchaser as being sufficient for 
austenitic grain size testing to be waived.

8.3.2.2, 8.3.2.3, or 8.3.2.4 shall be included in the test report. 
9. Quality 
9.1 General-Plates shall be free of injurious defects and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. 
9.2 Surface Impeifections: 
9.2.1 For plates produced from plate-as-rolled, all injurious 
surface imperfections shall be removed by the manufacturer. 
For plates produced from coil, all injurious surface imperfec­
tions shall be removed by the processor. 
9.2.1.1 Shallow imperfections shall be ground to sound 
metal; the ground area shall be well faired and the thickness of 
the ground plate shall not be reduced below the minimum 
thickness permitted. 
9 .2.1.2 All surface imperfections, the removal of which will 
reduce the plate thickness below the minimum thickness 
permitted, shall be cause for rejection of the plate, except that, 
73 
by agreement with the purchaser, the metal so removed may be 
replaced with weld metal (see 9.4). 
9.3 Edge Impeifections: 
9.3.1 Laminar-type discontinuities 1 in. [25 mm] and less in 
length visible to the unaided eye on an edge of a plate as 
prepared for shipment by the manufacturer or processor are 
acceptable and do not require exploration. 
9.3.2 All larger discontinuities shall be explored to deter­
mine their depth and extent. Discontinuities shall be considered 
continuous when located in the same plane within 5 % of the 
plate thickness and separated by a distance less than the length 
of the smaller of two adjacent discontinuities. 
9.3.3 Indications visible to the unaided eye on the cut edges 
of a plate as prepared for shipment by the manufacturer or 
processor shall not exceed the limits given in Columns 1 and 2 
of Table Al.14 [A2.14]. 
9.3.4 Larger indications shall be removed by the manufac­
turer or processor by grinding, provided that the resultant 
cavity does not exceed the limits given in Columns 3 and 4 of 
Table Al.14 [A2.14]. 
9.3.5 Indications of greater magnitude shall be cause for 
rejection of the plate, except that, by agreement with the 
purchaser, the defects may be removed and replaced with weld 
metal (see 9.4). 
9.3.6 Indications on the edges of a plate cut during the 
fabrication shall be cause for rejection of the plate at the 
discretion of the purchaser if the magnitude exceeds the limits 
given in Columns 5 and 6 of Table Al .14 [ A2. l 4]. The defects 
may be removed and replaced with weld metal (see 9.4). 
9.3.7 Fabricators should be aware that edge cracks may 
initiate upon bending a sheared or burned edge during the 
fabrication process. This is not considered to be a fault of the 
steel, but is rather a function of the induced cold work or heat 
affected zone. 
9.4 Repair by Welding: 
9.4.1 Repair welding shall be permitted only with the 
approval of the purchaser. 
9.4.2 Preparation for repair welding shall include inspection 
to confirm complete removal of the defect.

qualified in accordance with Section IX of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and repair welding 
shall be done by welders or welding operators meeting the 
qualification requirements of Section IX. 
9.4.4 The weld metal shall have the A-number analysis 
corresponding to the equivalent ASME P-number of the plate, 
except that A-1 or A-2 analysis weld metal may be employed 
for P-1 plates. Other weld metals may be employed that are 
compatible with the plate being repaired, if so approved by the 
purchaser. Such weld metals shall be qualified in accordance 
with the requirements of Section IX of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
9.4.5 If Charpy impact tests of the plate are required, the 
welding procedure qualification tests shall also include Charpy 
impact tests of the weld, the heat-affected zone, and the plate, 
and the test results shall be reported to the purchaser. 
9 .4.6 If the plate is subjected to normalizing, quenching and 
tempering, hot forming, or post-weld heat treating, the welding

SA-20/SA-Z0M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
procedure qualification test plates and the weld repaired plate 
shall be subjected to the thermal heat treatment as specified by 
the purchaser. 
9.4.7 In addition, repair welds shall meet the requirements 
of the construction code specified by the purchaser. 
10. Test Methods 
10.1 All tests shall be conducted in accordance with Test 
Methods and Definitions A370. 
10.2 Yield strength shall be determined by either the 0.2 % 
offset method or the 0.5 % extension under load method, unless 
otherwise stated in the applicable product specification. 
10.3 Rounding Procedures-For purposes of determining 
conformance with the applicable product specification, a cal­
culated value shall be rounded to the nearest 1 ksi [5 MPa] for 
tensile and yield strengths, and to the nearest unit in the 
right-hand place of figures used in expressing the limiting 
value for other values, in accordance with the rounding method 
given in Practice E29. 
11. Tension Tests 
11.1 Number of Test Coupons: 
11.1.1 Plates Produced from As-Rolled Plates-For other 
than quenched and tempered plates, one tension test coupon 
shall be taken from each plate-as-rolled. Two tension test 
coupons shall be taken from each quenched and tempered 
plate, as heat treated. If plates are furnished by the manufac­
turer or processor in accordance with 11.4.2 and qualified by 
using test specimens taken from heat-treated test coupons 
(including normalized, normalized and tempered, and 
quenched and tempered), one tension test coupon shall be 
taken from each plate-as-rolled (see Terminology A941 for the 
definition of plate-as-rolled). 
11.1.2 Plates Produced from Coil and Furnished without 
Heat Treatment or with Stress Relieving Only-Except as 
allowed by 11.1.2.1 and 11.1.4, a minimum of three tension 
coupons shall be taken from each coil as follows: 
11.1.2. l The first test coupon shall be taken immediately 
prior to the first plate to be qualified to the applicable product 
specification, the second test coupon shall be taken from the 
approximate center lap, and the third test coupon shall be taken 
immediately after the last plate to be qualified to the applicable 
product specification. If, during decoiling, the amount of 
material decoiled is less than that required to reach the next 
standard test location, a test for qualification of that particular 
portion of the coil shall be made from a test coupon taken from 
a location adjacent to the innermost portion decoiled. 
11.1.2.2 All plates between any two test locations that meet 
the requirements of the applicable product specification are 
acceptable. 
11. l.2.3 All plates between a test location that fails to meet 
the requirements of the applicable product specification and an 
adjacent test location that meets the requirements of the 
applicable product specification are rejectable, except that the 
processor has the option to malce other tests after cutting back 
the coil in either direction. 
11.1.3 Plates Produced from Coil and Furnished Heat 
Treated by Other than Stress Relieving-For other than 
74 
quenched and tempered plates, one tension test coupon shall be 
taken from each coil. Two tension test coupons shall be taken 
from each quenched and tempered plate, as heat treated. 
11.1.4 Plates Produced from Coil and Qualified Using Test 
Specimens Taken from Test Coupons Heat Treated by Other 
than Stress Relieving-One tension test coupon shall be taken 
from each coil. 
11.2 Orientation of Test Specimens-The longitudinal axis 
of the tension test specimens shall be transverse to the final 
rolling direction of the plate. 
11.3 Location of Test Coupons-Tension test coupons shall 
be taken from a corner of the plate. For quenched and tempered 
plates, the two tension test coupons shall be taken from 
opposite ends of the plate. 
11.4 Tests from Heat-Treated Plates: 
11.4.1 If heat treatment is performed by the manufacturer or 
processor, the test specimens shall be taken from the plate in 
the heat-treated condition or from full-thickness coupons 
simultaneously heat treated with the plate. 
11.4.2 If heat treatment is to be performed by the fabricator, 
the plates shall be accepted on the basis of tests made on test 
specimens taken from full-thickness coupons heat treated in 
accordance with the requirements specified in the applicable 
product specification or the purchase order. If the heat­
treatment temperatures are not specified, the manufacturer or 
processor shall heat treat the coupons under conditions it 
considers appropriate. The purchaser shall be informed of the 
procedure followed in heat treating the specimens. 
11.4.3 If approved by the purchaser, the procedures of 
11.4.2 may be implemented on plates heat treated by the 
manufacturer or processor, except that for plates that are 
quenched and tempered, all testing required the specification or 
the purchase order must be performed after plate heat 
treatment, in accordance with 11.1.1 and 11.4.4, and the results 
reported. 
11.4.4 For plates that are heat treated with a cooling rate 
faster than still-air cooling from the austenitizing temperature, 
one of the following shall apply in addition to other require­
ments specified herein: 
11.4.4.1 The gage length of the tension test specimen shall 
be talcen at least IT from any as-heat treated edge, where Tis 
the thickness of the plate, and shall be at least ½ in. [12.5 mm] 
from flame-cut or heat-affected-zone surfaces. 
11.4.4.2 A steel thermal buffer pad, 1 Tby lTby at least 3T, 
shall be joined to the plate edge by a partial penetration weld 
completely sealing the buffered edge prior to heat treatment. 
11.4.4.3 Thermal insulation or other thermal barriers shall 
be used during the heat treatment adjacent to the plate edge 
where the test specimens are to be removed. It shall be 
demonstrated that the cooling rate of the tension test specimen 
is no faster than, and not substantially slower than, that attained 
by the method described in 11.4.4.2. 
11 .4.4.4 When test coupons cut from the plate but heat 
treated separately are used, the coupon dimensions shall be not 
less than 3T by 3T by T and each tension test specimen cut 
from it shall meet the requirements of 11.4.4.1.

=== Page 127 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-20/SA-Z0M 
11.4.4.5 If cooling rate data for the plate and cooling rate 
control devices for the test coupons are available, the test 
coupons may be heat treated separately in the device, provided 
that this method is approved by the purchaser. 
11.5 Test Specimen Preparation: 
11.5.1 Tension test specimens for plates¾ in. [20 mm] and 
under in thickness shall be the full thickness of the plates. The 
test specimens shall conform to the requirements for either the 
1 ½-in. [ 40-mm] wide or the ½-in. [12.5-mm] wide rectangular 
tension test specimen of Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
The 1 ½-in. [ 40-mm] wide test specimen may have both edges 
parallel. The ½-in. [12.5-mm] wide specimen may have a 
maximum nominal thickness of¾ in. [20 mm]. 
11.5.2 For plates up to 4 in. [100 mm], inclusive, in 
thickness, tension test specimens may be the full thickness of 
the plate and conform to the requirements for the 1 ½-in. 
[ 40-mm] wide rectangular tension test specimen of Test Meth­
ods and Definitions A370 if adequate testing machine capacity 
is available. 
11.5.3 For plates over¾ in. [20 mm] in thickness, except as 
permitted in 11.5.2, tension test specimens shall conform to the 
requirements for the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] diameter test speci­
men of Test Methods and Definitions A370. For plates between 
3/4 in. [20 mm] and 1-1/2 in. [40 mm] inclusive in thickness, the 
axis of the test specimen shall be located at 1/2 T, the center of 
the thickness. For plates over 1-1/2 in. [40 mm], the axis of the 
test specimen shall be located at l/4T, midway between the center 
of the thickness and the top or the bottom surface of the plate. 
11.6 Elongation Requirement Adjustments: 
11.6.1 Due to the specimen geometry effect encountered 
when using the rectangular tension test specimen for testing 
thin plate, adjustments in elongation requirements must be 
provided for thicknesses under 0.312 in. [8 mm]. Accordingly, 
the following deductions shall be made from the base elonga­
tion requirements in the applicable product specification: 
Elongation 
Deduction,% Plate Nominal Thickness Range, in. [mm] 
0.299-0.311 [7.60-7.89] 0.5 
0.286-0.298 [7.30-7.59] 1.0 
0.273-0.285 [7.00-7.29] 1.5 
0.259-0.272 [6.60-6.99] 2.0 
0.246-0.258 [6.20-6.59] 2.5 
0.233-D.245 [5.90-6.19] 3.0 
0.219-0.232 [5.50-5.89] 3.5 
0.206-0.218 [5.20-5.49] 4.0 
0.193-0.205 [4.90-5.19] 4.5 
less than 0.193 [4.90] 5.0 
11.6.2 Due to the inherently lower elongation that is obtain­
able in thicker plate, adjustments in elongation requirements in 
2-in. [50-mm] gage length shall be provided for thicknesses 
over 3.5 in. [90 mm]. Accordingly, the following deductions 
shall be made from the base elongation requirements in 2 in. 
[50 mm] prescribed in the applicable product specification: 
Elongation 
Deduction, % Plate Nominal Thickness Range, in. [mm] 
3.501-3.999 [90.00-102.49] 0.5 
4.000-4.499 [102.50-114.99] 1.0 
4.500-4.999 [115.00-127.49] 1.5 
5.000-5.499 [127.50-139.99] 2.0 
5.500-5.999 [140.0-152.49] 2.5 
6.000 and thicker [152.50 and thicker] 3.0 
11.6.3 A characteristic of certain types of alloy steels is a 
local disproportionate increase in the degree of necking down 
or contraction of the test specimens during the tension test, 
resulting in a decrease in the percentage of elongation as the 
75 
gage length is increased. The effect is not so pronounced in 
thicker plates. For such material, if so stated in the applicable 
product specification for plates up to¾ in. [20 mm], inclusive, 
in thickness, if the percentage of elongation of an 8-in. 
[200-mm] gage length test specimen falls not more than 3 
percentage points below the amount prescribed, the elongation 
shall be considered satisfactory if the percentage of elongation 
in 2 in. [50 mm] across the break is not less than 25 %. 
11.6.4 The tensile requirements tables in many of the 
product specifications covered by this general requirements 
specification specify elongation requirements in both 8-in. 
[200-mm] and 2-in. [50-mm] gage lengths. Unless otherwise 
provided in the applicable product specification, both require­
ments are not required to be applied simultaneously, and the 
elongation need only be determined in the gage length appro­
priate for the test specimen used. After selection of the 
appropriate gage length, the elongation requirement for the 
alternative gage length shall be deemed not applicable. 
11. 7 This specification does not provide requirements for 
product tension testing subsequent to shipment (see 15.1). 
Therefore, the requirements of 11.1 through 11.6 and Section 
16 apply only for tests conducted at the place of manufacture 
prior to shipment. Compliance to Specification A20/20M and 
the applicable product specification does not preclude the 
possibility that product tension test results may vary outside 
specified ranges. The tensile properties will vary within the 
same plate-as-rolled or piece, be it as-rolled, control-rolled, or 
heat-treated. The purchaser should, therefore, be aware that 
tension testing in accordance with the requirements of Speci­
fication A20/ A20M does not provide assurance that all prod­
ucts of a plate-as-rolled will be identical in tensile properties 
with the products tested; If the purchaser wishes to have more 
confidence than that provided by Specification A20/ A20M 
testing procedures, additional testing or requirements, such as 
Supplementary Requirement S4, should be imposed. 
11.8 Appendix X2 provides additional information on the 
variability of tensile properties in plates for pressure vessels. 
12. Notch-Toughness Tests 
12.1 Charpy V-Notch Tests: 
12.1.1 Number of Tests-If Charpy V-Notch tests are 
specified, except for quenched and tempered plates, and except 
as allowed by 12.1.1.1 and 12.1.1.2, one impact test (3 
specimens) for each specified orientation (see 12.1.2) shall be 
made from each plate-as-rolled. For quenched and tempered 
plates, one impact test shall be made from each plate, as heat 
treated. 
12.1.1.1 Plates Ordered Without the Heat Treatment Speci­
fied by the Applicable Product Specification-Coupons for 
Charpy V-notch tests shall be taken in accordance with the 
same requirements as given for tensile test coupons in 11.4.2 
and 11.4.3. 
12.1.1.2 Plates Produced from Coil-If Charpy V-notch 
tests are specified, the number of impact tests required shall be 
the same as the number specified for tension tests in 11.1.2 or 
11.1.3, whichever is applicable. The test coupons shall be taken 
from the material after decoiling and leveling.

=== Page 128 ===

SA-20/SA-Z0M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
12.1.2 Orientation of Test Specimens-The long axis of the 
test specimens shall be oriented either longitudinal (parallel to 
the final direction of rolling) or transverse (transverse to the 
final direction of rolling), as specified in the applicable product 
specification or the purchase order. 
12.1.3 Location of Test Coupons-The impact test coupons 
shall be taken adjacent to the tension test coupons. The impact 
test coupons shall be subject to the same requirements as those 
specified for tension tests in 11.4, except that the provisions of 
11.4.4.1 apply to the area under the notch of the impact test 
specimen instead of to the gage length of the tension test 
specimen. 
12.1.4 Test Method-Impact testing shall be performed in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370 using 
Charpy V-notch (Type A) specimens as shown in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370. Except as allowed by 12.1.4.1, full-size 
specimens (0.394 by 0.394 in. [10 by 10 mm]) shall be used if 
the plate thickness permits, and their central axis shall corre­
spond as near as practical to the ¼ t plane in the plate thickness 
t. If the plate thickness is insufficient to obtain full-size 
specimens, the largest possible subsize specimens shall be 
used. 
12.1.4.1 For plates that normally have absorbed energy 
values in excess of 180 ft-lbf [245 J] if tested using full-size 
specimens at the specified testing temperature, subsize 0.394 
by 0.264 in. [10 by 6.7 mm] specimens may be used in lieu of 
full-size specimens; however, if this option is used, the 
acceptance value shall be 75 ft-lbf [100 J] minimum for each 
test specimen and the lateral expansion in mils [micrometres] 
shall be reported. 
12.1.5 Test Temperature-The test temperature shall be as 
specified by the product specification, if applicable, or by the 
purchaser, except that the manufacturer or processor shall have 
the option of using a lower test temperature. The actual test 
temperature used shall be reported with the test results. 
12.1.6 Acceptance Criteria-The acceptance criteria shall 
be as specified by the product specification, if applicable, or the 
purchaser. 
12.1.6.1 If the acceptance criteria is based upon energy 
absorption of a full-size specimen, the acceptance criteria for 
the various subsize specimens shall be as given in TableAl.16 
[A2.16], except as otherwise provided in 12.1.4.1. 
12.1.6.2 If the acceptance criterion is based upon lateral 
expansion opposite the notch, the acceptance value shall be the 
same for all sizes of test specimens. 
12.1.7 Marking-The letters "LTV" shall be stenciled or 
stamped on each plate following the class number, grade, etc. 
12.1.8 Variability-The impact properties of steel can vary 
within the same plate-as-rolled or piece, be it as-rolled, 
control-rolled, or heat-treated. The purchaser should, therefore, 
be aware that testing of one plate-as-rolled does not provide 
assurance that all locations within a plate-as-rolled will be 
identical in toughness with the location tested. Normalizing or 
quenching and tempering the product will reduce the degree of 
variation. 
12.1.8.1 Appendix X3 provides additional information on 
the variability of Charpy V-notch test properties in plates for 
pressure vessels.

12.2 Drop-Weight Tests: 
12.2.1 Where specified, one drop-weight test, consisting of 
a set of two test specimens, shall be made to the same 
frequency stated in 12.1.1 in accordance with Test Method 
E208. 
12.2.2 The test coupons shall be obtained adjacent to a 
tension test coupon. For plates produced from coil, the test 
coupon locations shall be the same as for Charpy V-notch tests. 
(See 12.1.) The provisions of 12.1.3 shall also apply. 
12.2.3 The testing temperature shall be as specified in the 
applicable product specification or the purchase order. 
12.2.4 Acceptance shall be on the basis of no-break perfor­
mance of both test specimens at the specified testing tempera­
ture. 
12.2.5 The plates shall be marked as required in 12.1.7, 
except that the letters "LTD" shall be used instead of "LTV." 
13. Identification of Plates 
13.1 Required Markings: 
13.1.1 Except as allowed by 13.4, plates shall be legibly 
marked with the following information: applicable ASTM 
designation (see 1.1) (year of issue not required); "G" or" MT" 
if applicable (see 13.1.2); applicable grade, type, and class; 
heat number; plate identifier; and name, brand, or trademark of 
the manufacturer (for plates produced in discrete cut lengths of 
flat product) or the processor (for plates produced from coil and 
for subdivided plates (see 13.4)). 
13.1.2 Plates that are required to be heat treated, but have 
not been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the manufacturer 
or processor, with the letter "G" ( denoting green) following the 
required ASTM designation mark, except that "G" marking is 
not necessary if such plates are for shipment, for the purpose of 
obtaining the required heat treatment, to an organization under 
the manufacturer's control. Plates that are required to be heat 
treated, and have been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the 
party that performed the heat treatment, with the letters "MT" 
( denoting material treated) following the required ASTM 
designation mark. 
Norn 2-Any stress relief of test specimens intended to simulate 
post-weld heat treatment is not included in the above heat treatment. 
13.2 Types of Marking: 
13.2.1 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates over ¼ in. [6 mm] in thickness shall be by steel die 
stamping, unless paint marking is specified in the purchase 
order. 
13.2.2 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates ¼ in. [6 mm] and under in thickness shall be by paint 
marking or by steel die stamping using low-stress (either 
round-nose or interrupted-dot) impressions. 
13.3 Location of Markings: 
13.3.1 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates with a maximum lengthwise or crosswise dimension 
more than 72 in. [1800 mm] shall be in at least two places on 
each finished plate, at least 12 in. [300 mm] from the edges of 
the plate. 
13.3.2 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates with a maximum lengthwise and crosswise dimension of

=== Page 129 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-20/SA-ZOM 
72 in. [1800 mm] or less shall be in at least one place on each 
finished plate, approximately midway between the center and 
an edge of the plate. 
13.4 Subdivided Plates: 
13.4.1 By agreement between the purchaser and the manu­
facturer or processor, each subdivided plate (a plate separated 
from a master plate) shall be legibly marked with the name, 
brand, or trademark of the organization that subdivided the 
plate plus a code traceable to the required markings, provided 
that the information required in 13.1, cross referenced to that 
code, is furnished with the plates. 
13.4.2 By agreement between the purchaser and the manu­
facturer or processor, subdivided plates that are from the same 
master plate and placed in secured lifts shall have the infor­
mation required in 13.1 paint marked on the top piece of each 
lift or shown on a substantial tag attached to each lift. 
13.5 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements of 13.1 to 
13.4 inclusive, the manufacturer or processor shall have the 
option of using bar coding as a supplementary identification 
method. 
Norn 3-Bar coding should be consistent with AIAG Standard B 1. 
14. Permissible Variations in Dimensions or Mass 
14.1 One cubic foot of rolled steel shall be assumed to 
weigh 490 lb, unless otherwise stated in the applicable product 
specification. One cubic metre of rolled steel is assumed to 
have a mass of 7850 kg, unless otherwise stated in the 
applicable product specification. 
14.2 For carbon steel plates the permissible variations for 
dimensions shall not exceed the applicable limits stated in 
Annex Al, Table Al.I to Table Al.9, and Table Al.13 [Annex 
A2, Table A2.1 to Table A2.9, and Table A2.13]. 
14.3 For alloy steel plates the permissible variations for 
dimensions shall not exceed the applicable limits stated in 
Annex 1, Table Al.I to Table Al.4, Table Al.8, and Table 
Al.IO to Table Al.13 [Annex 2, Table A2.l to Table A2.4, 
Table A2.8 and Table A2.10 to Table A2.13]. 
14.4 Permitted vaiiations on length and width for plates 
supplied on other than strip mills as mill edge shall be at the 
discretion of the manufacturer unless otherwise agreed to with 
the purchaser. For mill edge carbon steel, high-strength low­
alloy, and alloy plates produced on strip mills, the permitted 
variation in width shall not exceed the applicable limit stated in 
Table Al.17 [A2.16]. For mill edge carbon steel, high-strength 
low-alloy, and alloy plates produced on mill other than strip 
mills the permitted variation in width stated in Table Al.17 
[A2.16] may be specified only upon agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. Mill edge plates as delivered 
shall be capable of being trimmed by the purchaser to the 
required final rectangular size ordered. 
14.5 Conversions of Permitted Variations from Fractions of 
an Inch to Decimals-Pennitted variations in dimensions for 
products covered by this specification are generally given as 
fractions of inch and these remain the official permitted 
variations, where so stated. If the material is to be measured by 
equipment reporting dimensions as decimals, conversion of 
77 
permitted variations from fractions of an inch to decimals shall 
be made to three decimal places; using the rounding method 
prescribed in Practice E29. 
15. Inspection and Testing 
15.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry at all times while work on the contract of the purchaser 
is being pe1formed, to all parts of the manufacturer's works 
that concern the manufacture of the plate ordered. The manu­
facturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities to be 
satisfied that the plate is being furnished in accordance with 
this general requirements specification, the applicable product 
specification, and the purchase order. All tests (except product 
analysis) and inspection shall be made at the place of manu­
facture prior to shipment, unless otherwise specified, and shall 
be so conducted as not to inte1fere unnecessarily with the 
operation of the manufacturer's works. 
15.2 If plates are produced from coil, 15.1 shall apply to the 
"processor" instead of to the "manufacturer" and the "place of 
process" shall apply instead of the "place of manufacture." If 
plates are produced from coil and the processor is different 
from the manufacturer, the inspector representing the purchaser 
shall have free entry, at all times while work on the contract of 
the purchaser is being performed, to all parts of the manufac­
turer's works that concern the manufacture of the plate 
ordered. 
16. Retests 
16.1 Tension Test-In addition to the prov1s1ons of Test 
Methods and Definitions A370, the following retest provisions 
shall apply: 
16.1.1 If any test specimen shows defective machining, or 
develops flaws, it may be discarded and another test specimen 
substituted. 
16.1.2 If the percentage of elongation of any tension test 
specimen is less than that specified, and any part of the fracture 
is more than ¾ in. [20 mm] from the center of the gage length 
of a 2-in. [50-mm] test specimen or is outside the middle half 
of the gage length of an 8-in. [200-mm] test specimen as 
indicated by scribe marks on the test specimen before testing, 
one retest shall be allowed. 
16.1.3 If the results from an original tension test specimen 
fail to meet the specified requirements but are within 2 ksi [10 
MPa] of the required tensile strength or within 1 ksi [5 MPa] 
of the required yield strength or yield point, or within 2 
percentage points of the required elongation or reduction of 
area, one retest shall be pennitted to replace the failing test. 
16.1.4 The results of the retest shall meet the specified 
requirements. 
16.2 Charpy V-Notch Tests: 
16.2.1 The retest provisions of Test Methods and Defini­
tions A370 shall apply, except that the 5 ft·lbf [7 J] absolute 
minimum for an individual specimen shall not apply if two 
thirds of the specified minimum average is less than 5 ft-lbf [7 
J]. 
16.2.2 If Charpy V-notch impact test lateral expansion 
values are specified, if the value of one specimen falls below 
the specified minimum value and not below 2/3 of the specified

=== Page 130 ===

SA-20/SA-Z0M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
minimum value, and if the average of the three specimens 
equals or exceeds the specified minimum value, a retest of 
three additional specimens may be made. Each of the three 
retest specimens shall equal or exceed the specified minimum 
value. 
16.2.3 If the required values are not obtained on Charpy 
V-notch retests as specified in 16.2.1 and 16.2.2, or if the 
values in the initial test are below the values required for retest, 
no further retests are permitted unless the plate is heat treated 
or reheat treated. After heat treatment or reheat treatment, a set 
of three specimens shall be tested and each shall equal or 
exceed the specified minimum value. 
16.2.4 If the option of 12.1.4.1 is used and the test result 
falls below the 7 5 ft- lbf [ 100 J] minimum specified, another test 
may be made using full-size test specimens. 
17. Retreatment 
17 .1 If any heat-treated plate fails to meet the mechanical 
requirements of the applicable product specification, the manu­
facturer or processor shall have have the option of heat treating 
the plate again. All mechanical-property tests shall be repeated 
and the plate surface shall be reexamined for surface defects 
when it is resubmitted for inspection. 
18. Rejection 
18.1 Any rejection based upon product analysis made in 
accordance with the applicable product specification shall be 
reported to the supplier and samples that represent the rejected 
plate shall be preserved for 2 weeks from the date of notifica­
tion of such rejection. In case of dissatisfaction with the results 
of the tests, the supplier shall have the option of making claim 
for a rehearing within that time. 
18.2 Plates that show injurious defects subsequent to their 
acceptance at the manufacturer's or processor's works may be 
rejected. In such cases, the manufacturer or processor shall be 
notified. 
19. Test Reports 
19.1 The manufacturer or processor shall report the results 
of all tests required by the applicable product specification, the 
applicable supplementary requirements, and the purchase or­
der. The heat number, the plate identifier of the plate tested, and 
the nominal plate thickness shall be shown on the test report. 
The year-date of the specification to which the plates are 
furnished shall be included in the test report. 
19.1.1 In reporting elongation values, both the percentage 
increase and the original gage length shall be stated. 
19.2 For plates rolled from a strand-cast slab with a reduc­
tion ratio in the range from 2.0: 1 to 3.0: 1, exclusive, the 
specific practices (see 5.3.4 and 5.3.6) that were used by the 
manufacturer shall be reported, and the test reports shall state 
that the limitations of 5.3 have been met. 
19.3 All heat treatment, exclusive of subcritical heating to 
soften thermally cut edges, shall be reported, including tem­
perature ranges and times at temperature. This exclusion does 
not apply to those plates with specified minimum tensile 
strengths of 95 ksi [655 MPa] or higher, unless such subcritical 
78 
heating is accomplished at temperatures at least 75°F [40°C] 
below the minimum tempering temperature. The reports shall 
state whether the plates only, the test coupons only, or both 
plates and test coupons were heat treated. 
19 .4 If Charpy V-notch tests are specified, the test specimen 
size used shall be reported. 
19.5 If so specified in the purchaser order, the manufacturer 
shall also furnish a certificate of compliance stating that the 
plates have been manufactured, inspected, and tested in accor­
dance with the requirements of the applicable product specifi­
cation. For plates produced from coil, the processor shall 
furnish the required certification. 
19.6 For plates produced from coil and furnished without 
heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the results of all 
tests required by 11.1.2 shall be reported for each qualifying 
coil. 
19.7 Plates that are required to be heat treated, but have not 
been so heat treated, shall be certified by the responsible 
manufacturer on the basis of tests made on heat treated 
coupons and such tests shall be made and reported. For plates 
where the heat treatment of the coupons consists of quench and 
tempering, the manufacturer or processor responsible for the 
heat treatment of the plate shall repeat any required mechanical 
tests after plate heat treatment and they shall be the basis for 
final certification of the plate. 
19.8 A signature is not required on the test report; however, 
the document shall clearly identify the organization submitting 
the report. Notwithstanding the absence of a signature, the 
organization submitting the report is responsible for the content 
of the report. 
19.9 Copies of the original manufacturer's test report shall 
be included with any subsequent test report. 
19 .10 A test report, certificate of compliance, or similar 
document printed from or used in electronic form from an 
electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission shall be re­
garded as having the same validity as a counterpart printed in 
the certifier's facility. The content of the EDI transmitted 
document must meet the requirements of the invoked ASTM 
standard(s) and conform to any existing EDI agreement be­
tween the purchaser and the supplier. Notwithstanding the 
absence of a signature, the organization submitting the EDI 
transmission is responsible for the content of the report. 
20. Packaging, Marking, and Loading for Shipment 
20.1 Packaging, marking, and loading for shipment shallbe 
in accordance with those procedures recommended by Guide 
A700. 
20.2 For USA Government Procurement-Marking for ship­
ment of material for civil agencies shall be in accordance with

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following standardized supplementary requirements are for use if desired by the purchaser, 
Those that are considered suitable for use with a product specification are listed in the product 
specification. Other tests may be performed by agreement between the manufacturer or processor and 
the purchaser. These supplementary requirements shall apply only if specified in the purchase order, 
in which event the specified tests shall be made by the manufacturer or processor before shipment of 
the plates. 
Sl. Vacuum Treatment 
S 1.1 The steel shall be made by a process that includes 
vacuum degassing while molten. Unless otherwise agreed upon 
with the purchaser, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer 
to select suitable process procedures. 
S2. Product Analysis 
S2.1 A product analysis shall be made of each plate as 
rolled. The specimens for analysis shall be taken adjacent to or 
from a broken tension test specimen. 
S3. Simulated Post-Weld Heat Treatment of Mechanical 
Test Coupons 
S3.1 Prior to testing, the test coupons representing the plate 
for acceptance purposes for mechanical properties shall be 
thermally treated to simulate a post-weld heat treatment below 
the critical temperature (Ac 3 ), using the heat treatment param­
eters (such as temperature range, time, and cooling rates) 
specified in the purchase order. For tests using specimens taken 
from such heat treated test coupons, the test results shall meet 
the requirements of the applicable product specification. Test­
ing need only be performed and reported in the simulated 
post-weld heat treated condition. 
S4. Additional Tension Test 
S4.1 Other Than Quenched-and-Tempered Plates-In addi­
tion to the required single tension test, a second tension test 
shall be made using a test specimen taken from a test coupon 
taken from a corner of the plate-as-rolled on the end opposite 
the single test specimen and in a direction parallel to the single 
test specimen. The results obtained using this second test 
specimen shall meet the requirements of the applicable product 
specification. 
S4.2 Quenched-and-Tempered Plates 2 in. [50 mm] or 
Greater in Thickness-In addition to the required tension tests, 
two additional test coupons shall be taken from the bottom 
corner of the plate. One shall be taken at the center of the plate 
thickness and the other immediately beneath the surface. 
Mandatory conformance of these additional tests with the 
specified properties shall be a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
SS. Charpy V-Notch Impact Test 
S5.l Charpy V-notch impact tests shall be conducted in 
accordance with 12.1. 
79 
S5.2 The orientation of the test specimens, whether longi­
tudinal or transverse to the direction of rolling, shall be as 
specified in the purchase order. 
S5.3 The test temperature and the required acceptance 
criteria, if other than those required in 12.1, shall be as 
specified in the purchase order. 
S5.4 The recorded results shall include test specimen 
orientation, test specimen size, test temperature, absorbed 
energy values, and, if specified in the purchase order for other 
than Class VI plates, lateral expansion opposite the notch. The 
percent shear fracture appearance shall also be recorded if 
specified in the purchase order. 
S6. Drop-Weight Test (for Plates 0.625 in. [16 mm] and 
Over in Thickness) 
S6.l Drop-weight tests shall be made in accordance with the 
requirements of Test Method E208. The specimens shall 
represent the plates in the final condition of heat treatment. 
Agreement shall be reached between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer or processor as to the number of plates to be 
tested and whether a maximum NDT temperature is mandatory 
or if the test results are for information only. 
S7. High-Temperature Tension Tests 
S7.1 A sho1i-time elevated temperature tension test shall be 
made to represent each plate or each heat of steel as indicated 
by the purchaser. The specimens for testing shall be obtained as 
required for the room temperature tension tests specified in the 
body of this general requirements specification. The high­
temperature tests shall be made in accordance with the require­
ments of Test Methods E21. Mandatory conformance of such 
additional tests with the specified properties shall be a matter 
for agreement between the manufacturer or processor and the 
purchaser. 
SS. Ultrasonic Examination in Accordance with A435/ 
A435M 
S8.1 All plates shall be ultrasonically examined in accor­
dance with the requirements of Specification A435/ A435M. 
S9. Magnetic Particle Examination 
S9.l All plate edges shall be examined by magnetic par­
ticles in accordance with the procedures covered in Guide 
E709. The acceptability of defects revealed by this examina­
tion shall be judged in accordance with the requirements for 
quality in 9.3.

SlO. Charpy V-Notch Impact Transition Curve Sl9. Restricted Chemical Requirements 
S 10.1 Sufficient impact tests of the same specimen size shall 
be made from the plate test material to establish a transition 
curve. The test temperature range shall be wide enough to 
establish the upper and lower shelf energies, with sufficient 
testing at intermediate temperatures to permit plotting a rea­
sonable smooth curve. A plot of the data is not required. The 
manufacturer shall report the specimen orientation, test 
temperature, and absorbed energy for each specimen tested. 
Lateral expansion and percent shear shall also be reported 
when specified in the purchase order. The number of plates 
tested and the specimen orientation shall be the same as in 12.1 
unless otherwise specified in the purchase order. 
Sll. Ultrasonic Examination in Accordance with A577/ 
A577M 
Sll.1 All plates shall be ultrasonically examined in accor­
dance with the requirements of Specification A577 I A577M. 
S12. Ultrasonic Examination in Accordance with A578/ 
A578M 
Sl2.1 All plates shall be ultrasonically examined in accor­
dance with the requirements of Specification A578/A578M. 
The acceptance level shall be as specified in the RUrchase order. 
S13. NDT Temperature Determination 
S13.1 The NDT temperature shall be established in accor­
dance with Test Method E208 using coupons from a single 
plate. The number of plates to be so tested shall be subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer or 
processor. 
Sl5. Reduction of Area Measurement 
S 15 .1 A reduction of area measurement shall be taken while 
making the required tension test. Reduction of area shall be 
determined only-on the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] round specimen as 
shown in Fig. 5 of Test Methods and Definitions A370. The 
minimum acceptance limit shall be 40 % . 
S16. Thermal Stress Relief of Mechanical Test Coupons 
S16.1 Test coupons representing the plates shall be ther­
mally stress relieved by gradually and uniformly heating them 
to a temperature between 1100 and 1200°F [595 and 650°C], or 
a temperature range otherwise agreed upon between the 
manufacturer or processor and the purchaser, holding at tem­
perature for at least 1 h/in. [2.4 min/mm] of thickness and 
cooling in still air to a temperature not exceeding 600°F 
[315°C]. 
S17. Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized Steel 
S 17 .1 Material shall be vacuum carbon-deoxidized, in 
which case the silicon content at the time of vacuum deoxi­

A3. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW MATERIALS 
A3.l Proposals for the introduction of new plate materials 
to be covered by the general requirements in this specification, 
either by the addition of new grades within existing 
specifications, or by the creation of a new specification shall be 
subject to the following conditions: 
A3.l.1 The application for the addition of a new grade to a 
specification or a new specification shall be made to the chair 
of the subcommittee. Applications for new specifications 
remain subject to the approval of Committee A0l. Revisions to 
existing specifications for such reasons as chemistry or thick­
ness limitation are not subject to this annex. 
A3.l.2 The application shall contain documentation citing 
the requisite need for the new material and its intended use as 
outlined in Form and Style for ASTM Standards, BS. Scope.3 
That documentation may be in the form of a letter from a user, 
fabricator, another standards development organization, or 
producer stating the purpose and intended use for said new 
mate1ial. The Subcommittee may consider other evidence of 
need for the proposal. Additional background information as 
may be pertinent to the introduction of tlie new material may 
also be presented with the proposal. 
A3.l.3 The application shall be accompanied by test data as 
required by the applicable specification. Test data from a 
minimum of three test lots, as defined by the specification, each 
from a different heat, shall be furnished and shall include: 
A3.l.3.l Chemical data reflecting a suitable representation 
of tlie required chemistry range requested. 
A3.l.3.2 Mechanical property data representing the pro­
posed requirements in the delivered condition from each of the 
heats supplied. 
NoTE A3. l-To assist the balloting process, data from plates represent­
ing the maximum proposed thickness should be provided recognizing that 
in some cases the standard may be "limited only by the capacity of the 
composition to meet the specified mechanical property requirements." 
A3.l.3.3 Mechanical property data in the simulated Post­
Weld Heat Treatment (PWHT) condition if the product speci­
fication lists Supplementary Requirement S3. 
A3.l.3.4 Evidence of weldability if the material is intended 
for welded construction as may be referenced in the Scope 
section of the new or existing standard. 
NoTE A3.2-Such evidence is at the discretion of the submitter. 
Common methodology may include but not be limited to a single ASME 
Section IX qualification such as is referenced in 9 .4 of this specification. 
A3.l.4 Other properties that are not specification require­
ments that further describe the material, including physical 
properties, are not mandatory. However, to the extent that such 
information may assist the Subcommittee in evaluating the 
proposal they may be included. Omission of such non-essential 
documentation shall not be a cause for rejection of the 
application by the subcommittee. 
A3.l.5 The application shall state whether or not a patent 
covers ilie new material. 
APPENDIXES 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. COILED STEEL 
Xl.1 Continuous wide hot strip rolling mills are nonnally 
equipped with coilers. Regardless of the different types of 
systems employed during or following the rolling operations, it 
is common for the steel to be reeled into the coiler at 
temperatures in the stress-relieving range. In general, such 
temperatures are higher as the steel thickness increases. The 
coils subsequently cool to ambient temperature with outer and 
inner laps cooling more rapidly than central laps. The differ-
98 
ence in cooling rate can result in measurable differences in the 
mechanical properties throughout a coil. Data confirm reduced 
yield and tensile strength, and increased percent elongation, for 
the product wiili slower cooling rates from the coiling tem­
perature to ambient. Such differences are in addition to the 
effects on mechanical properties caused by differences in heat 
analysis and chemical segregation.

X2. VARIATION OF TENSILE PROPERTIES IN PLATE-AS-ROLLED 
X2.1 The tension requirements of this general requirements 
specification are intended only to characterize the tensile 
properties of a plate-as-rolled for determination of confor­
mance to the requirements of the applicable product specifica­
tions. Such testing procedures are not intended to define the 
upper or lower limits of tensile properties at all possible test 
locations within a plate-as-rolled. It is well known and docu­
mented that tensile properties vary within a plate-as-rolled or 
individual piece of steel as a function of chemical composition, 
processing, testing procedure, and other factors. It is, therefore, 
incumbent on designers and engineers to use sound engineer­
ing judgement when using tension test results shown on mill 
test reports. The testing procedures of this general require­
ments specification have been found to provide plate adequate 
for normal pressure vessel design criteria. 
X2.2 A survey of the variation to be expected in tensile 
properties obtained from plates and strnctural shapes was 
conducted by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). 
The results of this survey are contained in a Contributions to 
the Metallurgy of Steel entitled "The Variation of Product 
Analysis and Tensile Properties-Carbon Steel Plates, and 
Wide Flange Shapes" (SU/18, SU/19, and SU/20), published in 
September 197 4. The data are presented in tables of probability 
that tensile properties at other than the official location may 
differ from those of the reported test location. 
X2.3 This general requirements specification contains no 
requirements applicable to product tension tests; conformance 
to the applicable product specification is determined on the 
basis of tests performed at the place of manufacture or 
processing prior to shipment, unless otherwise specified. 
X2.4 A Task Group of ASTM Subcommittee AOl.11 has 
determined, based on review of the AISI data (SU20), that the 
variation in tensile properties within a plate-as-rolled can be 
expressed as a function of specified requirements; one standard 
deviation equals approximately 3 % of required tensile 
strength, 5 % of required yield strength, and 3 percentage 
points of required elongation. 
X3. VARIATION IN CHARPY V-NOTCH TESTS 
X3. l A survey of the variation to be expected in Charpy 
V-Notch test results obtained from three common fine grain 
plate steels was conducted by the American Iron and Steel 
Institute (AISI). 7 The results of the survey are contained in a 
Contributions to the Metallurgy of Steel entitled, "The Varia­
tions of Charpy V-Notch Impact Test Properties in Steel 
Plates," (SU/24), published January 1979. The survey data 
consists of test values obtained from six locations in addition to 
the locations specified in 12.1.3 of this specification. The plate 
conditions tested involved as-rolled, normalized, and quench 
and tempered. Sufficient full-size specimens were taken from 
each sample so that three longitudinal and three transverse 
specimens could be broken at three test temperatures defined 
for each grade. The data is presented in tables of probability 
that impact properties at other than the official location which 
may differ from those of the reported test location. Additional 
data of the same type, but utilizing samples from thicker plates, 
was published by AISI as SU/27. 
X4. RADIUS FOR COLD BENDING 
X4. l Suggested minimum inside bend radii for cold form­
ing are referenced to group Designations A through F as 
defined in Table X4.1. The suggested radii listed in Table X4.2 
should be used as minimums in typical shop fabrication. 
Material that does not form satisfactorily when fabricated in 
accordance with Table X4.2 may be subject to rejection 
pending negotiation with the steel supplier. When tighter bends 
are required, the manufacturer should be consulted. 
X4.2 The bend radius and the radius of the male die should 
be as liberal as the finished part will permit. The width across 
the shoulders of the female die should be at least 8 times the 
plate thickness. Higher strength steels require larger die open­
ings. The surface of the dies in the area of radius should be 
smooth. 
99 
X4.3 Since cracks in cold bending commonly originate 
from the outside edges, shear burrs and gas cut edges should be 
removed by grinding. Sharp corners on edges and on punched 
or gas cut holes should be removed by chamfering or grinding 
to a radius. 
X4.4 If possible, parts should be formed such that the bend 
line is perpendicular to the direction of final rolling. If it is 
necessary to bend with the bend line parallel to the direction of 
final rolling, a more generous radius is suggested (11/2 times 
applicable value given in Table X4.2 for bend lines perpen­
dicular to the direction of rolling).

can Iron and Steel Institute (AISI):

4. Chemical Composition 
4.1 Limits: 
4.1.1 The chemical composition shall conform to the re­
quirements specified in the purchase order or the individual 
product specifications. For convenience, the grades commonly 
specified for carbon steel bars are shown in Table 1 and for 
alloy steel bars in Table 2. Bars may be ordered to these grade 
designations and when so ordered shall conform to the speci-
. fied limits by heat analysis. 
4.1.2 When compositions other than those shown in Tables 
1 and 2 are required, the composition limits shall be prepared 
using the ranges and limits shown in Table 3 for carbon steel 
and Table 4 for alloy steel. 
4.2 Heat or Cast Analysis: 
4.2.l The chemical composition of each heat or cast shall be 
determined by the manufacturer in accordance with Test 
Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751. 
4.2.2 The heat or cast analysis shall conform to the require­
ments specified in the product specification or purchase order. 
These can be the heat chemical range and limit for a grade 
designated in Tables 1 and 2, or another range and limit in 
accordance with 4.1.2, or with requirements of the product 
specification. 
Norn 2-Heat analysis for lead is not determinable since lead is added 
to the ladle stream while each ingot is poured. When specified as an added 
element to a standard steel, the percentage of lead is reported as 0.15 to 
0.35 incl, which is the range commonly specified for this element. 
4.2.3 If requested or required, the heat analysis shall be 
reported to the purchaser or his representative. 
4.2.4 Reporting of significant figures and rounding shall be 
in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology 
A751. 
4.3 Product Analysis: 
4.3.1 Merchant quality carbon bar steel is not subject to 
rejection for product analysis unless misapplication of a heat is 
clearly indicated. 
4.3.2 Analyses may be made by the purchaser from finished 
bars other than merchant quality representing each heat of 
open-hearth, basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace steel. The 
chemical composition thus determined shall not vary from the 
limits specified in the applicable specification by more than the 
amounts prescribed in Table 5 and Table 6, but the several 
determinations of any element, excluding lead, in a heat may 
not vary both above and below the specified range. Rimmed or 
capped steel is characterized by a lack of homogeneity in its 
composition, especially for the elements carbon, phosphorus, 
and sulfur; therefore, when rimmed or capped steel is specified 
or required, the limitations for these elements shall not be 
applicable. Because of the degree to which phosphorus and 
sulfur segregate, the limitations for these elements shall not be 
applicable to rephosphorized or resulfurized steels. 
4.3.3 Samples for product analysis shall be taken by one of 
the following methods: 
4.3.3.1 Applicable to small sections whose cross-sectional 
area does not exceed 0.75 in.2 [500 mm 2 ] such as rounds, 
squares, hexagons, and the like. Chips are taken by milling or 
machining the full cross section of the piece. Drilling is not a 
feasible method for sampling sizes 0.75 in. 2 and smaller. 
4.3.3.2 Applicable to products where the width of the cross 
section greatly exceeds the thickness, such as bar size shapes 
and light flat bars. Chips are taken by drilling entirely through 
the steel at a point midway between the edge and the middle of 
the section, or by milling or machining the entire cross section. 
4.3.3.3 Applicable to large rounds, squares semifinished, 
etc. Chips are taken at any point midway between the outside 
and the center of the piece by drilling parallel to the axis or by 
milling or machining the full cross section. In cases where 
these methods are not practicable, the piece may be drilled on 
the side, but chips are not taken until they represent the portion 
midway between the outside and the center. 
4.3.3.4 When the steel is subject to tension test 
requirements, the tension test specimen can also be used for 
product analysis. In that case, chips for product analysis can be 
taken by drilling entirely through the tension test specimens or 
by the method described in 4.3.3.1. 
4.3.4 When chips are taken by chilling, the diameter of the 
drill used shall conform to the following: 
Area of Sample Cross Section, Approximate Drill Diameter, 
in. 2 [cm 2 ] in. [mm] 
16 [1 OD] or less ½ [12.5] 
Over 16 [100] 1 [25.0] 
4.3.5 The minimum number of samples to be taken from 
material representing the same heat or lot before rejection by 
the purchaser shall be as follows: 
104 
Minimum Number 
of Samples 
15 tons [15 Mg] and under 4 
Over 15 tons [15 Mg] 6 
4.3.6 In case the number of pieces in a heat is less than the 
number of samples required, one sample from each piece shall 
be considered sufficient. 
4.3.7 In the event that product analysis determinations are 
outside the permissible limits as prescribed in 4.3.2, additional 
samples shall be analyzed and the acceptability of the heat 
negotiated between the purchaser and the producer. 
4.4 Referee Analysis-In case a referee analysis is required 
and agreed upon to resolve a dispute concerning the results of 
a chemical analysis, the referee analysis shall be performed in 
accordance with the latest issue of Test Methods, Practices, and 
Terminology A751, unless otherwise agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
5. Grain Size Requirement 
5.1 Austenitic Grain Size-All requirements for austenitic 
grain size control in Section 5 refer to the size of the austenite 
grain which forms during a subsequent bar reheating operation 
at or above the recrystallization temperature. These require­
ments do not apply to, nor do they in any way control, the p1ior 
austenite grain size or the ferrite grain size of the bar in the 
as-rolled condition. 
5.1.1 When a coarse austenitic grain size is specified, the 
steel shall have a grain size number of 1 to 5 exclusive as

8 When silicon is required, the following ranges and limits are commonly specified: 0.1 0 %, max, 0.1 0 % to 0.20 %, 0.15 % to 0.35 %, 0.20 % to 0.40 %, or 0.30 % to 
0.60%. 
c Copper can be specified when required as 0.20 % minimum. 
0 When lead is required as an added element to a standard steel, a range of 0.15 to 0.35 % inclusive is specified. Such a steel is identified by inserting the letter "L" between 
the second and third numerals of the grade designation, for example, 10 L 45. A cast or heat analysis is not determinable when lead is added to the ladle stream. 
"When boron treatment for killed steels is specified, the steels can be expected to contain 0.0005 to 0.003 % boron. If the usual titanium additive is not permitted, the 
steels can be expected to contain up to 0.005 % boron. 
FThe elements bismuth, calcium, selenium, or tellurium may be added as agreed upon between purchaser and supplier. 
G Unless prohibited by the purchaser, the manganese content may exceed 0.60 % on heat analysis to a maximum of 0.75 %, provided the carbon range on heat analysis 
has the minimum and maximum reduced by 0.01 % for each 0.05 % manganese over 0.60 %. 
determined in accordance with Test Methods El12. Confor­
mance to this grain size of 70 % of the grains in the area 
examined shall constitute the basis of acceptance. One test per 
heat shall be made. 
5.1.2 When a fine austenitic grain size is specified, the steel 
shall have a grain size number of 5 or higher as determined in 
accordance with Test Methods El12. Conformance to this 
grain size of 70 % of the area examined shall constitute the 
basis of acceptance. One test per heat shall be made unless the 
provisions of 5.1.2.1 or 5.1.2.2 are exercised. 
5.1.2.1 When aluminum is used as the grain refining 
element, the fine austenitic grain size requirement shall be 
deemed to be fulfilled if, on heat analysis, the aluminum 
content is not less than 0.020 % total aluminum or, alternately, 
0.015 % acid soluble aluminum. The aluminum content shall 
be reported. The grain size test specified in 5.1.2 shall be the 
referee test. 
106 
5.1.2.2 By agreement between purchaser and supplier, co­
lumbium or vanadium, or both, may be used for grain refining 
instead of or with aluminum. When columbium or vanadium is 
used as a grain refining element, the fine austenitic grain size 
requirement shall be deemed to be fulfilled if, on heat analysis, 
the columbium or vanadium content is as follows (the content 
of the elements shall be reported with the heat analysis): 
Steels having 0.25 % carbon or less: 
Cb 0.025 min 
V 0.05 min 
Steels having over 0.25 % carbon: 
Cb 0.Q15 min 
V 0.02 min

| Norte 1—Small quantities of certain elements are present in alloy steels, which are not specified or required. These elements are considered as incidental :
and may be present to the following maximum amounts: copper, 0.35 %; nickel, 0.25 %; chromium, 0.20 % and molybdenum, 0.06 %.
Note 2—Where minimum and maximum sulfur content is shown it is indicative of resulfurized steel. i
Note 3—The chemical ranges and limits shown in Table 2 are produced to product analysis tolerances shown in Table 6. |
| Norse 4—Standard alloy steels can be produced with a lead range of 0.15 to 0.35 %. Such steels are identified by inserting the letter “L” between the
second and third numerals of the AISI number, for example, 41 L 40. A cast or heat analysis is not determinable when lead is added to the ladle stream. :

A Silicon may be specified by the purchaser as 0.10 % maximum. The need for 0.10 % maximum generally relates to severe cold-formed parts. 
8 The purchaser may also require the following maximums: copper 0.30 %; aluminum 0.050 %; oxygen 0.0015 %. 
c These steels can be expected to contain 0.0005 to 0.003 % boron. If the usual titanium additive is not permitted, the steels can be expected to contain up to 0.005 % 
boron. 
5.1.2.3 When provisions of 5.1.2.1 or 5.1.2.2 are exercised, 
a grain size test is not required unless specified by the 
purchaser. Unless otherwise specified, fine austenitic grain size 
shall be certified using the analysis of grain refining element(s). 
5.1.2.4 Referee Test-In the event that the chemical analysis 
of columbium 8 or vanadium does not meet the requirements of 
108 
5.1.2.2, the grain size test shown in 5.1.2 shall be the referee 
test unless an alternative test method is agreed upon between 
the manufacturer and the purchaser.

6. Mechanical Property Requirements 
6.1 Test Specimens: 
6.1.1 Selection-Test specimens shall be selected in accor­
dance with the requirements of the applicable product specifi­
cation or in accordance with Supplement I of the latest issue of 
Test Methods and Definitions A370, in the sequence named. 
6.1.2 Preparation-Unless otherwise specified in the appli­
cable product specification, test specimens shall be prepared in 
accordance w1th the latest issue of Test Methods and Defini­
tions A370, and especially Supplement I thereof. 
6.2 Methods of Mechanical Testing-All mechanical tests 
shall be conducted in accordance with the latest issue of Test 
Methods and Definitions A370, and especially Supplement I 
thereof, on steel bar products. 
6.3 Retests: 
6.3.1 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws, the specimen may be discarded and another 
substituted. 
6.3.2 If the percentage elongation of any tension specimen 
is less than that specified and any part of the fracture is more 
than ¾ in. [20 mm] from the center of a 2 in. [50 mm] 
specimen, or is outside the middle half of the gage length of an 
8 in. [200 mm] specimen as indicated by scribe scratches 
marked on the specimen before testing, a retest shall be 
allowed. 
6.3.3 For "as-wrought" material, if the results for any 
original tension specimen are within 2000 psi [14 MPa] of the 
required tensile strength, within 1000 psi [7 MPa] of the 
required yield point, or within 2 % of the required elongation, 
retesting shall be permitted. If the original testing required only 
one test, the retest shall consist of two random tests from the 
heat or lot involved. If the original testing required two tests of 
which one failed by the amounts listed in this paragraph, the 
retest shall be made on one random test from the heat or lot. If 
the results on the retest specimen or specimens meet the 
specified requirements, the heat or test lot will be accepted. If 
the results of one retest specimen do not meet the specified 
requirements, the material is subject to rejection. 
6.3.4 For thermally treated bars, if the results of the me­
chanical tests do not conform to the requirements specified, 
two more tests may be selected for each bar failing, and each 
of these retests shall conform to the requirements of the 
product specification. 
6.3.5 If a bend specimen fails, due to conditions of bending 
more severe than required by the specification, a retest shall be 
permitted from the heat or test lot involved for which one 
random specimen for each original specimen showing failure 
shall be used. If the results on the retest specimen meet the 
requirements of the specification, the heat or test lot will be 
accepted. 
7. Dimensions, Mass, and Permissible Variations 
7 .1 Hot-Wrought Bars-The permissible variations for di­
mensions of hot-wrought carbon and alloy steel bars shall not 
exceed the applicable limits stated in Annex Al for inch-pound 
values and Annex A2 for metric values. 
8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
8.1 The material shall be free of injurious defects and shall 
have a workmanlike finish. 
9. Rework and Retreatment 
109 
9.1 For thermally treated bars only, the manufacturer may 
retreat a lot one or more times, and retests shall be made in the 
same manner as the original tests. Each such retest shall 
conform to the requirements specified. 
10. Inspection 
10.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry, at all times while work on the contract of the purchaser

1.1 This specification covers carbon steel shapes, plates, 
and bars of structural quality for use in riveted, bolted, or 
welded construction of bridges and buildings, and for general 
structural purposes. 
1.2 Supplementary requirements are provided for use where 
additional testing or additional restrictions are required by the 
purchaser. Such requirements apply only when specified in the 
purchase order. 
1.3 When the steel is to be welded, a welding procedure 
suitable for the grade of steel and intended use or service is to 
be utilized. See Appendix X3 of Specification A6/A6M for 
information on weldability. 
1.4 The text of this specification contains notes or footnotes, 
or both, that provide explanatory material. Such notes and 
footnotes, excluding those in tables and figures, do not contain 
any mandatory requirements. 
1.5 For structural products produced from coil and fur­
nished without heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the 
additional requirements, including additional testing require­
ments and the reporting of additional test results, of Specifi­
cation A6/ A6M apply. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system is to 
be used independently of the other, without combining values 
in any way. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the

[Identical with ASTM Specification A47/A 47M-99(2018)'1, except for the deletion of welded repair references in 11.2 and 11.3, and mandatory 
certification in 14.1.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers ferritic malleable castings 
for general engineering usage at temperatures from normal 
ambient to approximately 400°C (750°F). 
1.2 No precise quantitative relationship can be stated 
between the properties of the iron in various locations of 
the same casting and those of a test specimen cast from 
the same iron (see Appendix Xl). 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconfonnance 
with the specification.

7.2 Tension Test Specimens: 
7 .2.1 The tension test specimens shall be cast to the 
form and dimensions shown in Fig. 1 or Fig. 2, in the same 
kind of molding material used for the production castings. 
At least three such specimens shall be cast from a represen­
tative ladle of iron either from each batch-melted heat or, 
in continuous melting, from each 4 h pour period during 
which the purchaser's castings were poured, or as otherwise 
agreed upon between manufacturer and purchaser. 
7.2.2 All test specimens shall be suitably identified 
with the designation of either the batch-melted heat or the 
pour period of a continuous heat. 
7 .2.3 All test specimens shall be heat treated in the 
same production furnaces and in the same cycles as the 
castings they represent. However, in those instances 
wherein the critical sections of the production castings 
differ appreciably from that of the central portion of the 
test specimens, the time cycle for tempering the test speci­
mens may be altered from that of the production lot in 
order to obtain similar microstructures or hardness, or both, 
in both specimen and castings. In such cases the hardness 
of the specimens shall be tested and reported along with 
the tensile test results. 
7.2.4 The tension test is usually performed on unma­
chined specimens. However, for referee work, the speci­
men may be machined from the standard cast bar to the 
dimensions shown in Fig. 3. 
7.3 Tension Test Method: 
7.3.1 The gage length of the standard tension speci­
men shall be 2.00 ± 0.ol in. [50.0 ± 0.3 mm]. 
7 .3.2 The diameter used to compute the cross-sec­
tional area shall be the average between the largest and 
smallest diameters in that section of the 2 in. [50 mm] 
gage length having the smallest diameter and shall be mea­
sured to the nearest 0.001 in. [0.2 mm]. No cast bar having 
a mean diameter less than 0.590 in. [15.0 mm] shall be 
accepted for test. 
7.3.3 After reaching a stress equivalent to approxi­
mately half of the anticipated yield stress, the speed of the 
moving head of the testing machine shall not exceed 
0.50 in./min [12.5 mm/min] through the breaking load. 
7.3.4 While the values for yield point and yield 
strength are not identical, they are sufficiently close for 
most applications of ferritic malleable irons to be used 
interchangeably. They may be determined by any of the 
approved techniques described in the paragraphs on Deter­
mination of Yield Strength and Yield Point of Test Methods 
E 8. If determined as yield strength, that stress producing 
an extension under load of 0.01 in. [0.25 mm] over the 
2 in. [50 mm] gage length (for example, 0.5% extension) 
or an offset of 0.2% shall be taken as the yield stress, 
which shall be converted to yield strength by dividing by 
the original cross-sectional area of the gage length found 
in accordance with 7.3.2. It shall be reported to the nearest 
100 psi [MPa]. In referee work, yield strength shall be 
determined as the stress that produces an extension under 
load of 0.5% of the gage length. 
7 .3.5 The tensile strength shall be the maximum load 
carried by the specimen during the test divided by the 
original cross-sectional area of the gage length, as found 
in accordance with 7.3.2. It shall be reported to the nearest 
100 psi [MPa]. 
7 .3.6 The elongation is the increase in gage length 
after fracture of a tensile specimen, measured to the nearest 
0.01 in. [0.25 mm], expressed as a percentage of the origi­
nal gage length. It shall be reported to the nearest 0.5%. 
7.4 Retesting: 
7.4.1 If, after testing, a specimen shows evidence of 
a defect, another tension test may be made on a companion 
specimen. Also, a retest shall be permitted whenever frac­
ture occurs outside the central 50% of the gage length. 
7 .4.2 If the results of a valid test fail to conform to 
the requirements of this specification, two retests shall be 
made. If either retest fails to meet the specification, the 
castings represented by these test specimens shall be 
rejected. A valid test is one wherein the test specimen has 
been properly prepared and appears to be sound and on 
which the approved test procedure has been followed. 
131 
7.4.3 If sufficient companion test bars are unavail­
able, the manufacturer shall have the option of testing a 
specimen cut from a representative casting. Therefore, as 
stated in Xl.3, the mechanical properties of such tension 
test specimen removed from a production casting will not 
necessarily correspond to those of a standard separately 
cast test specimen, the values in Table 1 do not apply. 
Instead, the mechanical properties of the test specimen 
from the casting must equal or exceed the average of those 
from similar test specimens removed from the same loca­
tion from two castings of the same design where separately 
cast test bars meet the requirements of Table 1. 
7 .4.4 If the first test results indicate that a reheat 
treatment is needed to meet the test requirements, the entire 
lot of castings and the representative test specimens shall 
be reheat treated together. Testing shall then be repeated 
in accordance with 7.4.1-7.4.3. 
7 .4.5 The results of all tests, including retests, shall 
be posted in permanent record, which shall state any abnor­
malities observed during the test and in the fractured ends. 
Such records shall be kept for at least 1 year after shipment 
of the production castings and shall be available for exami­
nation by the purchaser or by his authorized representative. 
7 .4.6 If not covered in the purchase agreement, the 
frequency of tension testing shall be in accordance with 
7.2.1 and sufficiently often to ensure uniformity of product 
and compliance with minimum test requirements.

=== Page 184 ===

SA-47 /SA-47M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
7.4.7 Tension test results, obtained in accordance 
with the above subsections, must conform to the values of 
Table 1 for acceptance under this specification except as 
provided in 7.4.3. 
7 .4.8 When agreed upon between manufacturer and 
purchaser, tested specimens or unbroken test bars shall be 
preserved by the manufacturer for a period of three months 
after the date of the test report. 
1.5 Hardness Test- If the purchase agreement requires 
hardness testing, the acceptable hardness range shall be 
stated and a test location clearly shown on the covering 
drawing(s). 
7.5.1 Hardness Test Method - The Brinell method 
of hardness testing in accordance with Test Method E 10 
shall be employed whenever possible. 
7.5.2 For castings of such size or shape that do not 
permit Brinell testing with the standard 3000-kgf load, the 
500 kgf may be employed, the hardness number being 
reported as HB 10/500/15. In very unusual cases where it 
is impossible to use the Brinell method, the Rockwell 
test may be substituted, using Test Methods E 18 with 
an appropriate Rockwell scale. Conversions of hardness 
values from one method to another according to Standard 
E 140, which does not specifically cover cast irons, are 
approximate only and, therefore, are generally inadvisable. 
7.5.3 Sufficient material shall be removed from the 
cast surface to ensure that the measured surface is represen­
tative. 
7 .5.4 Sampling procedures and the frequency of 
hardness testing shall be fully detailed on the purchase 
agreement. Otherwise, hardness tests shall be performed 
at the discretion of the producer. 
7 .5.5 Castings failing to conform to the required 
hardness range may be reheat treated and retested. If after 
reheat treating they still fail the hardness requirements, 
they shall be rejected. 
7.5.6 Typical hardness maximums for this grade of 
malleable iron are listed in Table 2. 
8. Microstructure Requirements 
8.1 The microstructure of the malleable iron shall con­
sist of temper carbon nodules distributed through a ferritic 
matrix and shall be free of excessive pearlite, massive 
carbides, and primary. graphite. 
8.2 When agreed upon by the purchaser and producer, 
the maximum decarburization at any as-cast surface after 
heat treatment may be stipulated in writing, as measured 
by visual depletion of combined carbon after polishing, 
etching in nital, and viewing at lOOX. 
132 
8.3 In reference work, the metallographic practice rec­
ommended in Test Method A 247 shall be followed. 
9. Soundness Requirements 
9.1 All castings, on visual examination, shall be sound 
and free of obvious shrinkage and porosity. 
9.2 If the purchaser requires soundness tests to be per­
formed, it shall be so stated in the purchase agreement, and 
the method and soundness requirements shall be detailed. 
10. Dimensional Requirements 
10.1 The castings shall conform to the dimensions 
given on drawings furnished by the purchaser, or to the 
dimensions established by the pattern equipment supplied 
by the purchaser, or as agreed upon in specific cases to 
gages supplied by the purchaser. Variations in any solid 
dimensions will be permitted, as shown in Table 3, unless 
otherwise agreed upon by the foundry and purchaser. 
11. Workmanship, Finish and Appearance 
11.1 The surface of the casting shall be inspected visu­
ally, particularly in critical areas, for such surface defects 
as cracks, hot tears, adhering sand and scale, cold shuts, 
and gas holes. 
11.2 No repairing or plugging of any kind shall be 
permitted unless written permission is granted by the pur­
chaser. Welding or brazing is not permitted under any 
circumstances. 
11.3 DELETED 
12. Responsibility for Inspection 
12.1 Unless otherwise specified in the contract or pur­
chase order, the manufacturer shall be responsible for car­
rying out all the tests and inspections required by this 
specification, using his own or other reliable facilities, and 
he shall maintain complete records of all such tests and 
inspections. Such records shall be available for review by 
the purchaser. 
12.2 The purchaser reserves the right to perform any 
inspection set forth in the specification where such inspec­
tions are deemed necessary to ensure that supplies and 
services conform to the prescribed requirements. 
13. Rejection and Rehearing 
13.1 Any casting or lot of castings failing to comply 
with the requirements of this specification may, where 
possible, be reprocessed, retested, and reinspected. If the

=== Page 185 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-47 /SA-47M 
tests and inspections on the reprocessed casting(s) show 
compliance with this specification, the castings shall be 
acceptable; if they do not, they shall be rejected. 
13.2 If the purchaser should find that a casting or lot . 
of castings fails to comply with this specification subse­
quent to receipt at his facility, he shall so notify the manu­
facturer promptly and in no case later than six weeks after 
receipt of the shipment, stating clearly his basis for rejec­
tion. In case of dissatisfaction with the purchaser's claim, 
the manufacturer may apply for a hearing before final 
rejection of the shipment. 
14. Certification 
14.1 A manufacturer's certification or compliance 
statement that the casting or lot of castings was made, 
sampled, tested, and inspected in accordance with this spec­
ification, including a report of test results signed by an 
authorized agent of the manufacturer, shall be furnished at 
the time of shipment, and such certification or compliance 
statement shall be the basis for acceptance of the casting 
or lot of castings.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
Sl. Special Conditions 
Sl.1 If agreed upon in writing by the foundry and 
purchaser, the malleable iron castings may be required to 
meet special conditions, hardness or other property dimen­
sions, surface quality, or a combination of conditions. 
S2. Test Lugs 
S2.1 If requested in writing or if included on the pat­
tern(s) or pattern drawing(s), test lugs may be cast on all 
castings of sufficient size to permit their incorporation. 
The size of such lugs shall be proportional to the thickness 
of the casting. On castings over 24 in. [600 mm] in length, 
a test lug shall be cast near each end such as not to interfere 
with any subsequent processing of the castings. The pur­
chase order shall stipulate whether the foundry's inspector 
or the purchaser's inspector shall break, inspect, and pass 
judgment on the fracture quality of these test lugs. 
S3. Destructive Tests 
S3.1 At the option of the purchaser or his representa­
tive, a casting of each design ordered may be tested to 
destruction, or otherwise broken up, to determine the pres­
ence of any manufacturing condition that might be detri­
mental to the serviceability of the casting. 
136 
S4. Special Tension Specimens 
S4.1 If tension specimens are to be machined from 
castings, their location in the casting, the specimen dimen­
sions, and the required properties shall be agreed upon in 
writing by the foundry and purchaser. 
SS. Zinc-Coated Castings 
SS.1 When specified in the contract or purchase order, 
castings shall be zinc-coated by the hot-dip process in 
accordance with Specification A 153. Castings shall be of 
a composition that will preclude the possibility of galvaniz­
ing embrittlement, or shall be either cooled from the anneal 
or subsequently heat treated so as to be immunized against 
such embrittlement. If regalvanizing is required, proce­
dures for regalvanizing castings and determining the effect 
on the casting performance must be agreed upon between 
the purchaser and the seller. 
S6. Marking of Casting for Government 
Procurement 
S6.1 When castings are specified for government pro­
curement, the location of the permanent markings specified 
in 15.1, as well as any special marking for mechanical or 
physical properties (either permanent or temporary), shall 
be as indicated on the government drawings or sketches.

APPENDIX 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF 
CASTINGS 
Xl.1 The mechanical properties of malleable iron cast­
ings are influenced by a number of factors, including the 
cooling rate during solidification, chemical composition, 
the heat treatment, the design of the casting, section thick­
ness, and the location and effectiveness of gates, risers, 
and chills. 
Xl.2 Because of the complexity of these factors in 
influencing the properties of the final product, no precise 
quantitative relationship can be stated between the proper­
ties of the iron in various locations of the same casting or 
between the properties of a casting and those of a test 
specimen cast from the same iron. When such a relationship 
is important and must be known for a specific application, 
it may be determined by appropriate experimentation. 
Xl.3 The specimen specified in 7 .2.1 as the. standard 
tensile test bar for malleable iron has a ¾ in. [16 mm] 
diameter test section that reasonably represents a typical 
section of the general run of malleable iron castings. Fur­
thermore, the initial freezing of malleable irons as homoge­
neous white iron, together with the heat treatment that is 
inherent in the manufacture of malleable iron, tends to 
reduce the section-sensitivity effect. Therefore, where 
experimentation into precise properties within a given cast­
ing would be infeasible, this standard test bar, made like 
any typical casting, should provide a practical approxima­
tion of the properties that can be expected in average sound 
malleable iron casting. 
Xl.4 If malleable iron castings are welded, the micro­
structure of the iron is markedly affected, particularly in 
the heat-affected zone. Therefore, since this may adversely 
affect the properties of the casting, the welding of malleable 
iron castings should be done under strict metallurgical 
control, followed by appropriate post-weld heat treatment, 
to minimize the substantial reductions in ductility, impact 
resistance, and machinability that could result, particularly 
in the vicinity of the weldment. Nevertheless, it is generally 
considered inadvisable to join castings to similar castings 
or to other materials, by fusion welding out in the field, 
or in manufactured assemblies, without fully testing the 
entire completed part.

SA-53/SA-53M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Pipe, Steel, Black and Hot-Dipped, Zinc-Coated, Welded and 
Seamless 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers seamless and welded black 
and hot-dipped galvanized steel pipe in NPS 1/s to NPS 26 [DN 
6 to DN 650] (Note 1), inclusive, with nominal wall thickness 
(Note 2) as given in Table X2.2 and Table X2.3. It shall be 
permissible to furnish pipe having other dimensions provided 
that such pipe complies with all other requirements of this 
specification. Supplementary requirements of an optional na­
ture are provided and shall apply only when specified by the 
purchaser. 
NoTE 1-The dimensionless designators NPS (nominal pipe size) [DN 
(diameter nominal)] have been substituted in this specification for such 
traditional terms as "nominal diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
NoTE 2--The term nominal wall thickness has been assigned for the 
purpose of convenient designation, existing ill name only, and is used to 
distinguish it from the actual wall thickness, which may vary over or 
under the nominal wall thickness. 
1.2 This specification covers the following types and 
grades: 
1.2.1 Type F-Fumace-butt-welded, continuous welded 
Grade A, 
1.2.2 Type &-Electric-resistance-welded, Grades A and B, 
and 
1.2.3 Type S-Seamless, Grades A and B. 
NoTE 3-See Appendix Xl for definitions of types of pipe. 
1.3 Pipe ordered under this specification is intended for 
mechanical and pressure applications and is also acceptable for 
ordinary uses in steam, water, gas, and air lines. It is suitable 
for welding, and suitable for forming operations involving 
coiling, bending, and flanging, subject to the following quali­
fications: 
1.3.1 Type Fis not intended for flanging. 
1.3.2 If Type S or Type Eis required for close coiling or 
cold bending, Grade A is the preferred grade; however, this is 
not intended to prohibit the cold bending of Grade B pipe. 
1.3.3 Type E is furnished either nonexpanded or cold 
expanded at the option of the manufacturer. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.5 The following precautionary caveat pertains only to the 
test method portion, Sections 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, and 15 of this 
specification: This standard does not purport to address all of 
the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory requirements prior to use. 
1.6 The text of this specification contains notes or footnotes, 
or both, that provide explanatory material. Such notes and 
footnotes, excluding those in tables and figures, do not contain 
any mandatory requirements.

1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

7.1 Tension Test: 
7 .1.1 For tension tests other than transverse weld tension 
tests, the yield strength corresponding to a permanent offset of 
0.2 % of the gage length or to an extension of 0.5 % of the gage 
length under load, the tensile strength, and the elongation in 2

U = specified minimum tensile strength, psi [MPa]. 
8 See Table X4.1 or Table X4.2, whichever is applicable, for the minimum 
elongation values that are required for various combinations of tension test 
specimen size and specified minimum tensile strength. 
7 .2 Bend Test: 
7.2.1 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] or smaller, a sufficient length 
of pipe shall be capable of being bent cold through 90° around 
a cylindrical mandrel, the diameter of which is twelve times the 
specified outside diameter of the pipe, without developing 
cracks at any portion and without opening the weld. 
7.2.2 If ordered for close coiling, the pipe shall stand being 
bent cold through 180° around a cylindrical mandrel, the 
diameter of which is eight times the specified outside diameter 
of the pipe, without failure. 
7.2.3 Double-extra-strong pipe over NPS 1 V4 [DN 32] need 
not be subjected to the bend test. 
7 .3 Flattening Test: 
7.3.1 The flattening test shall be made on welded pipe over 
NPS 2 [DN 50] in extra-strong weight or lighter. 
7.3.2 Seamless Pipe: 
7.3.2.1 Although testing is not required, pipe shall be 
capable of meeting the flattening test requirements of Supple­
mentary Requirement S 1, if tested. 
7.3.3 Electric-Resistance-Welded Pipe: 
7.3.3.1 A test specimen at least 4 in. [100 mm] in length 
shall be flattened cold between parallel plates in three steps, 
with the weld located either 0° or 90° from the line of direction 
of force as required by 7.3.3.2 or 7.3.3.3, whichever is 
applicable. During the first step, which is a test for ductility of 
the weld, except as allowed by 7.3.5, 7.3.6, and 7.3.7, no cracks 
or breaks on the inside or outside surface at the weld shall be 
present before the distance between the plates is less than two 
thirds of the specified outside diameter of the pipe. As a second 
step, the flattening shall be continued as a test for ductility 
away from the weld. During the second step, except as allowed 
by 7.3.6 and 7.3.7, no cracks or breaks on the inside or outside 
surface away from the weld shall be present before the distance 
between the plates is less than one third of the specified outside 
diameter of the pipe but is not less than five times the specified 
wall thickness of the pipe. During the third step, which is a test 
for soundness, the flattening shall be continued until the test 
specimen breaks or the opposite walls of the test specimen 
meet. Evidence of laminated or unsound material or of incom­
plete weld that is revealed by the flattening test shall be cause 
for rejection. 
142 
7.3.3.2 For pipe produced in single lengths, the flattening 
test specified in 7.3.3.1 shall be made using a test specimen

=== Page 195 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-53/SA-53M 
taken from each end of each length of pipe. The tests from each 
end shall be made alternately with the weld at 0° and at 90° 
from the line of direction of force. 
7.3.3.3 For pipe produced in multiple lengths, the flattening 
test specified in 7.3.3.1 shall be made as follows: 
(1) Test specimens taken from, and representative of, the 
front end of the first pipe intended to be supplied from each 
coil, the back end of the last pipe intended to be supplied from 
each coil, and each side of any intermediate weld stop location 
shall be flattened with the weld located at 90° from the line of 
direction of force. 
(2) Test specimens taken from pipe at any two locations 
intermediate to the front end of the first pipe and the back end 
of the last pipe intended to be supplied from each coil shall be 
flattened with the weld located at 0° from the line of direction 
of force. 
7.3.3.4 For pipe that is to be subsequently reheated through­
out its cross section and hot formed by a reducing process, the 
manufacturer shall have the option of obtaining the flattening 
test specimens required by 7.3.3.2 or 7.3.3.3, whichever is 
applicable, either prior to or after such hot reducing. 
7.3.4 Continuous-Welded Pipe-A test specimen at least 4 
in. [100 mm] in length shall be flattened cold between parallel 
plates in three steps. The weld shall be located at 90° from the 
line of direction of force. During the first step, which is a test 
for ductility of the weld, except as allowed by 7.3.5, 7.3.6, and 
7.3.7, no cracks or breaks on the inside, outside, or end 
surfaces at the weld shall be present before the distance 
between tl1e plates is less than three fourths of the specified 
outside diameter of the pipe. As a second step, the flattening 
shall be continued as a test for ductility away from the weld. 
During the second step, except as allowed by 7.3.6 and 7.3.7, 
no cracks or breaks on the inside, outside, or end smfaces away 
from the weld shall be present before the distance between the 
plates is less than 60 % of the specified outside diameter of the 
pipe. During the third step, which is a test for soundness, the 
flattening shall be continued until the test specimen breaks or 
the opposite walls of the test specimen meet. Evidence of 
laminated or unsound material or of incomplete weld that is 
revealed by the flattening test shall be cause for rejection. 
7.3.5 Surface imperfections in the test specimen before 
flattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening 
test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements 
in Section 12. 
7.3.6 Superficial ruptures as a result of surface imperfec­
tions shall not be cause for rejection. 
7.3.7 For pipe with a D-to-t ratio less than 10, because the 
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the 
inside surface at the 6 and 12 o'clock locations, cracks at such 
locations shall not be cause for rejection. 
8. Hydrostatic Test 
8.1 The hydrostatic test shall be applied, without leakage 
through the weld seam or the pipe body. 
8.2 Plain-end pipe shall be hydrostatically tested to the 
applicable pressure given in Table X2.2, and threaded-and­
coupled pipe shall be hydrostatically tested to the applicable 
pressure given in Table X2.3. It shall be pennissible, at the 
discretion of the manufacturer, to perform the hydrostatic test 
on pipe with plain ends, with threads only, or with threads and 
couplings; and it shall also be permissible to test pipe in either 
single lengths or multiple lengths. 
NoTE 4-The hydrostatic test pressures given herein are inspection test 
pressures, are not intended as a basis for design, and do not have any direct 
relationship to working pressures. 
8.3 The minimum hydrostatic test pressure required to 
satisfy the requirements specified in 8.2 need not exceed 2500 
psi [17 200 kPa] for pipe NPS 3 [DN 80] or smaller or 2800 
psi [19 300 kPa] for pipe larger than NPS 3 [DN 80]; however, 
the manufacturer has the option of using higher test pressures. 
For all sizes of seamless pipe and electric-resistance-welded 
pipe, the hydrostatic test pressure shall be maintained for at 
least 5 s. 
9. Nondestructive Electric Test 
9.1 Type E Pipe: 
_9. l. l Except for pipe produced on a hot-stretch reducing 
111111, the weld seam of each length of electric-resistance­
welded pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] or larger shall be tested with a 
nondestructive electric test in accordance with Practices E213 
E273, E309, or E570. Each length of electric-resistance~ 
welded pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] or larger and produced on a 
hot-stretch-reducing mill shall be tested with a nondestructive 
electric test that inpsects the full volume of the pipe in 
accordance with Practices E213, E309, or E570. 
9.1.2 Ultrasonic and Electromagnetic Inspection-Any 
equipment utilizing the ultrasonic or electromagnetic principles 
and capable of continuous and uninterrupted inspection of the 
weld seam shall be used. The equipment shall be checked with 
an applicable reference standard as described in 9.1.3 at least 
once every working tum or not more than 8 h to demonstrate 
its effectiveness and the inspection procedures. The equipment 
shall be adjusted to produce well-defined indications when the 
reference standard is scanned by the inspection unit in a 
manner simulating the inspection of the product. 
9.1.3 Reference Standards-The length of the reference 
standards shall be determined by the pipe manufacturer, and 
they shall have the same specified diameter and thickness as 
the product being inspected. Reference standards shall contain 
machined notches, one on the inside surface and one on the 
outside surface, or a drilled hole, as shown in Fig. 1, at the 
option of the pipe manufacturer. The notches shall be parallel 
to the weld seam, and shall be separated by a distance sufficient 
to produce two separate and distinguishable signals. The 1 /s-in. 
[3.2-mm] hole shall be drilled through the wall and perpen­
dicular to the surface of the reference standard as shown in Fig. 
1. Care shall be taken in the preparation of the reference 
standard to ensure freedom from fins or other edge roughness, 
or distortion of the pipe. 
Norn 5-The calibration standards shown in Fig. 1 are convenient 
standards for calibration of nondestmctive testing equipment. The dimen­
sions of such standards are not to be construed as the minimum sizes of 
imperfections detectable by such equipment. 
143

tance lilnit signals in percent of the height of signals produced 
by reference standards. Imperfections in the weld seam that

in Table 3 shall be considered a defect unless the pipe 
manufacturer can demonstrate that the imperfection does not 
reduce the effective wall thickness beyond 12.5 % of the 
specified wall thickness. 
9.2 Type S Pipe-As an alternative to the hydrostatic test at 
the option of the manufacturer or if specified in the purchase 
order, the full body of each seamless pipe shall be tested with 
a nondestructive electric test in accordance with Practice E213, 
E309, or E570. In such cases, each length so furnished shall 
include the mandatory marking of the letters "NDE." Except as 
allowed by 9.2.6.2, it is the intent of this nondestructive electric 
test to reject pipe with imperfections that produce test signals 
equal to or greater than those produced by the applicable 
calibration standards. 
9.2.1 If the nondestructive electric test has been performed, 
the lengths shall be marked with the letters "NDE." The 
certification, if required, shall state Nondestructive Electric 
Tested and shall indicate which of the tests was applied. Also, 
the letters NDE shall be appended to the product specification 
number and grade shown on the certification. 
9 .2.2 The following information is intended to facilitate the 
use of this specification: 
9.2.2.1 The calibration standards defined in 9.2.3 through 
9.2.5 are convenient standards for calibration of nondestructive 
testing equipment. The dimensions of such standards are not to 
be construed as the minimum sizes of imperfections detectable 
by such equipment. 
9.2.2.2 The ultrasonic testing referred to in this specification 
is capable of detecting the presence and location of significant 
longitudinally or circumferentially oriented imperfections; 
however, different techniques need to be employed for the 
detection of differently oriented imperfections. Ultrasonic test­
ing is not necessarily capable of detecting short, deep imper­
fections. 
9.2.2.3 The eddy current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
discontinuities, especially of the short abrupt type. 
9.2.2.4 The flux leakage examination referred to in this 
specification is capable of detecting the presence and location 
of significant longitudinally or transversely oriented disconti­
nuities. The provisions of this specification only require 
longitudinal calibration for flux leakage. Different techniques 
need to be employed for the detection of differently oriented 
imperfections. 
9.2.2.5 The hydrostatic test referred to in 8.2 has the 
capability of finding imperfections of a size permitting the test 
fluid to leak through the tube wall and may be either visually 
seen or detected by a loss of pressure. Hydrostatic testing is not 
necessarily capable of detecting very tight through-the-wall 
imperfections or imperfections that extend an appreciable 
distance into the wall without complete penetration. 
144 
9.2.2.6 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of imperfections that are 
capable of being detected in the specific application of these 
examinations is directed to discuss this with the manufacturer 
of the tubular product. 
9.23 For ultrasonic testing, the calibration reference 
notches shall be at the option of the manufacturer, and shall be 
any one of the three common notch shapes shown in Practice 
E213. The depth of notch shall not exceed 12.5 % of the 
specified wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], 
whichever is the greater.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-53/SA-53M 
9.2.4 For eddy current testing, the calibration pipe shall 
contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following calibration standards to establish a minimum sensi­
tivity level for rejection. 
9.2.4.1 Drilled Hole-The calibration pipe shall contain 
three holes spaced 120° apart or four holes spaced 90° apart, 
sufficiently separated longitudinally to ensure separately dis­
tinguishable responses. The holes shall be drilled radially and 
completely through the pipe wall, care being taken to avoid 
distortion of the pipe while drilling. Dependent upon the 
nominal pipe size, the calibration pipe shall contain the 
following hole: 
NPS DN Diameter of Drilled Hole 
:51/2 :,; 15 0.039 In. [1.0 mm] 
> ½ :5 1¼ > 15 :,; 32 0.055 in. [1.4 mm]

> 2:,; 5 > 50:,; 125 0.087 in. [2.2 mm] 
>5 > 125 0.106 in. [2.7 mm] 
9.2.4.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool or 
file with a ¼ in. [6 mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe. The notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater. 
9.2.4.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
pipe axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to a depth not 
exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
9.2.4.4 Compatibility-The calibration standards in the cali­
bration pipe shall be compatible with the testing equipment and 
the method being used. 
9.2.5 For flux leakage testing, the longitudinal calibration 
reference notches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a 
radial plane parallel to the pipe axis. For specified wall 
thicknesses less than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], outside and inside 
notches shall be used. For specified wall thicknesses equal to or 
greater than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], only an outside notch shall be 
used. The notch depth shall not exceed 12.5 % of the specified 
wall thickness, or 0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater. 
The notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25 mm], and the notch 
width shall not exceed the notch depth. Outside diameter and 
inside diameter notches shall be located sufficiently apart to 
allow separation and identification of the signals. 
9.2.6 Pipe containing one or more imperfections that pro­
duce a signal equal to or greater than the signal produced by the 
calibration standard shall be rejected or the area producing the 
signal shall be rejected. 
9.2.6.1 Test signals produced by imperfections that cannot 
be identified, or produced by cracks or crack-like 
imperfections, shall result in rejection of the pipe, unless it is 
repaired and retested. To be accepted, the pipe shall pass the 
same specification test to which it was originally subjected and 
the remaining wall thickness shall not have been decreased 
below that permitted by the specification. It shall be permis­
sible to reduce the outside diameter at the point of grinding by 
the amount so removed. 
9.2.6.2 It shall be permissible to evaluate test signals pro­
duced by visual imperfections in accordance with the provi­
sions of Section 12. A few examples of such imperfections are 
straightener marks, cutting chips, scratches, steel die stamps, 
stop marks, or pipe reducer ripple. 
9.2.7 The test methods described in Section 9 are not 
necessarily capable of inspecting the end portion of pipes. This 
condition is referred to as end effect. The length of the end 
effect shall be determined by the manufacturer and, if specified 
in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
10. Permissible Variations in Weight (Mass) and 
Dimensions 
10.1 Weight (Mass)-The weight (mass) of the pipe shall 
not vary more than± 10 % from its specified weight (mass), as 
derived by multiplying its measured length by its specified 
weight (mass) per unit length, as given in Table X2.2 or Table 
X2.3, or as calculated using the relevant equation in ASME 
B36.10M. 
No'!B 6-For pipe NPS 4 [DN 100] or smaller, the weight (mass) 
tolerance is applicable to the weights (masses) of the customary lifts of 
pipe as produced for shipment by the mill. For pipe larger than NPS 4 [DN 
100], where individual lengths are weighed, the weight (mass) tolerance is 
applicable to the individual lengths. 
10.2 Diameter-For pipe NPS 1 ½ [DN 40] or smaller, the 
outside diameter at any point shall not vary more than ± 1/64 in. 
[0.4 mm] from the specified outside diameter. For pipe NPS 2 
[DN 50] or larger, the outside diameter shall not vary more 
than ± 1 % from the specified outside diameter. 
10.3 Thickness-The minimum wall thickness at any point 
shall be not more than 12.5 % under the specified wall 
thickness. The minimum wall thickness on inspection shall 
conform to the requirements given in Table X2.4. 
11. End Finish 
11.1 If ordered with plain ends, the pipe shall be furnished 
to the following practice, unless otherwise specified. 
11.1.1 NPS 1½ [DN 40] or Smaller-Unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order, end finish shall be at the option 
of the manufacturer. 
11.1.2 Larger than NPS l½ [DN 40]: 
11.1.2.1 Pipe of standard-weight or extra-strong weight, or 
in wall thickness less than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], other than 
double extra-strong weight pipe, shall be plain-end beveled 
with ends beveled to an angle of 30°, +5°, -0°, measured from 
a line drawn perpendicular to the axis of the pipe, and with a 
root face of 1/16 in. ± 1/32 in. [1.6 mm ± 0.8 mm]. 
145 
11.1.2.2 Pipe with a specified wall thickness greater than 
0.500 in. [12.7 mm], and all double extra-strong weight pipe, 
shall be plain-end square cut. 
11.2 If ordered with threaded ends, the pipe ends shall be 
provided with a thread in accordance with the gaging practice 
and tolerances of ANSI B 1.20.1. For standard-weight pipe NPS 
6 [DN 150] or smaller, refer to Table X3.l for threading data. 
For standard-weight pipe NPS 8 [DN 200] or larger and all 
sizes of extra-strong weight pipe and double extra-strong 
weight pipe, refer to Table X3.2 for threading data. Threaded

SA-53/SA-53M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
pipe NPS 4 [DN 100] or larger shall have thread protectors on 
the ends not protected by a coupling. 
11.3 If ordered with couplings, one end of each length of 
pipe shall be provided with a coupling manufactured in 
accordance with Specification A865/ A865M. The coupling 
threads shall be in accordance with the gaging practice of ANSI 
B 1.20.1. The coupling shall be applied handling-tight, unless 
power-tight is specified in the purchase order. Couplings are to 
be made of steel. Taper-tapped couplings shall be furnished on 
all threaded pipe NPS 2½ [DN 65] or larger. For pipe smaller 
than NPS 2½ [DN 65], it is regular practice to furnish 
straight-tapped couplings for standard-weight pipe and taper­
tapped couplings for extra-strong and double extra-strong 
weight pipe. If taper-tapped couplings are required for 
standard-weight pipe smaller than NPS 2½ [DN 65], it is 
recommended that line pipe threads in accordance with API 
Specification 5B be ordered. The taper-tapped couplings pro­
vided on line pipe in such sizes may be used on mill-threaded 
standard-weight pipe of the same size. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient num­
ber of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable 
assurance that they have been properly evaluated with respect 
to depth. 
12.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 12.5 % 
of the specified wall thickness or encroach on the minimum 
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with defects 
shall be given one or more of the following dispositions: 
12.2.1 The defect shall be removed by grinding, provided 
that the remaining wall thickness is within specified limits, 
12.2.2 Type S pipe and the parent metal of Type E pipe, 
except within ½ in. [13 mm] of the fusion line of the 
electric-resistance-weld seam, are permitted to be repaired in 
accordance with the welding provisions of 12.5. Repair weld­
ing of Type F pipe and the weld seam of Type E pipe is 
prohibited. 
12.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect shall be cut 
off within the limits of requirement on length, or rejected. 
12.3 At the purchaser's discretion, pipe shall be subjected to 
rejection if surface defects repaired in accordance with 12.2 are 
not scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is 
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall 
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
12.4 For the removal of imperfections and defects by 
grinding, a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the 
wall thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by 
this specification. It shall be permissible to reduce the outside 
diameter at the point of grinding by the amount so removed. 
12.5 Weld repair shall only be permitted with the approval 
of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification A530/ 
A530M. 
12.6 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight. 
12.7 The pipe shall contain no dents greater than 10 % of 
the pipe diameter or ¼ in. [6 mm], whichever is smaller, 
146 
measured as the gap between the lowest point of the dent and 
a prolongation of the original contour of the pipe. Cold-formed 
dents deeper than 1/s in. [3 mm] shall be free of sharp-bottomed 
gouges; it shall be permissible to remove the gouges by 
grinding, provided that the remaining wall thickness is within 
specified limits. The length of the dent in any direction shall 
not exceed one half the specified outside diameter of the pipe. 
13. Number of Tests 
13.1 Except as required by 13.2, one of each of the tests 
specified in Section 7 shall be made on test specimens taken 
from one length of pipe from each lot of each pipe size. For 
continuous-welded pipe, each lot shall contain no more than 25 
tons [23 Mg] of pipe for pipe sizes NPS 1 ½ [DN 40] and 
smaller, and no more than 50 tons [ 45 Mg] of pipe for pipe 
sizes larger than NPS 1 ½ [DN 40]. For seamless and electric­
resistance-welded pipe, a lot shall contain no more than one 
heat, and at the option of the manufacturer shall contain no 
more than 500 lengths of pipe (as initially cut after the final 
pipe-forming operation, prior to any further cutting to the 
required ordered lengths) or 50 tons [45 Mg] of pipe. 
13.2 The number of flattening tests for electric-resistance­
welded pipe shall be in accordance with 7.3.3.2 or 7.3.3.3, 
whichever is applicable. 
13.3 Except as allowed by 9.2, each length of pipe shall be 
subjected to the hydrostatic test (see Section 8). 
14. Retests 
14.1 Except for flattening tests of electric-resistance-welded 
pipe, if the results of a mechanical test for a lot fail to conform 
to the applicable requirements specified in Section 7, the lot 
shall be rejected unless tests of additional pipe from the 
affected lot of double the number originally tested are subse­
quently made and each such test conforms to the specified 
requirements. Only one retest of any lot will be permitted. Any 
individual length of pipe that conforms to the test requirements 
is acceptable. Any individual length of pipe that does not 
conform to the test requirements may be resubmitted for test 
and will be considered acceptable if tests taken from each pipe 
end conform to the specified requirements. 
14.2 Electric-Resistance-Welded Pipe Produced in Single 
Lengths-If any flattening test result fails to conform to the 
requirements specified in 7.3.3, the affected single length shall 
be rejected unless the failed end is subsequently retested using 
the same weld orientation as the failed test and a satisfactory 
test result is obtained before the pipe's length is reduced by 
such testing to less than 80 % of its length after the initial 
cropping. 
14.3 Electric-Resistance-Welded Pipe Produced in Multiple 
Lengths-If any flattening test result fails to conform to the 
requirements specified in 7.3.3, the affected multiple length 
shall be rejected or flattening tests shall be made using a test 
specimen taken from each end of each individual length in the 
failed multiple length. For each pipe end, such tests shall be 
made with the weld alternately at 0° and 90° from the line of 
direction of force. Individual lengths are considered acceptable 
if the test results for both pipe ends conform to the specified 
requirements.

15. Test Methods 
15.1 The test specimens and the tests required by this 
specification shall conform to those described in the latest issue 
of Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
15.2 Each longitudinal tension test specimen shall be taken 
from a pipe end and shall not be flattened between the gage 
marks. 
15.3 Test specimens for bend tests and flattening tests shall 
be taken from pipe. Test specimens for flattening tests shall be 
smooth on the ends and free from burrs. 
15.4 Tests shall be conducted at room temperature. 
16. Lengths 
16.1 Unless otherwise specified, pipe lengths shall be in 
accordance with the following regular practices: 
16.1.1 Except as allowed by 16.1.2 and 16.1.4, pipe lighter 
than extra-strong weight shall be in single-random lengths of 
16 to 22 ft [4.88 to 6.71 m], with not more than 5 % of the total 
number of threaded lengths furnished being jointers (two 
pieces coupled together). 
16.1.2 For plain-end pipe lighter than extra-strong weight, it 
shall be permissible for not more than 5 % of the total number 
of pipe to be in lengths of 12 to 16 ft [3.66 to 4.88 m]. 
16.1.3 Pipe of extra-strong weight or heavier shall be in 
random lengths of 12 to 22 ft [3.66 to 6.71 m], except that it 
shall be permissible for not more than 5 % of the total of pipe 
to be in lengths of 6 to 12 ft [1.83 to 3.66 m]. 
16.1.4 For extra-strong weight or lighter pipe ordered in 
double-random lengths, the minimum lengths shall be not less 
than 22 ft [6.71 m] and the minimum average length for the 
order shall be not less than 35 ft [10.67 m]. 
16.1.5 For pipe heavier than extra-strong weight ordered in 
lengths longer than single random, the lengths shall be as 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
16.1.6 If pipe is furnished threaded and coupled, the length 
shall be measured to the outer face of the coupling. 
17. Galvanized Pipe 
17 .1 Galvanized pipe ordered under this specification shall 
be coated with zinc inside and outside by the hot-dip process. 
The zinc used for the coating shall be any grade of zinc 
conforming to Specification B6. The galvanized pipe shall be 
free from uncoated areas, blisters, flux deposits, and gross 
dross inclusions. Lumps, projections, globules, or heavy de­
posits of zinc which will interfere with the intended use of the 
material will not be permitted. 
17.2 Weight (Mass) per Unit Area of Coating-The weight 
(mass) per unit area of zinc coating shall be not less than 1.8 
oz/ft 2 [0.55 kg/m 2 ] as determined from the average results of 
the two specimens taken for test in the manner prescribed in 
17.5 and not less than 1.6 oz/ft2 [0.49 kg/m 2 ] for each of these 
specimens. The weight (mass) per unit area of coating, ex­
pressed in ounces per square foot [kilograms per square metre] 
shall be calculated by dividing the total weight (mass) of zinc, 
inside plus outside, by the total area, inside plus oµtside, of the 
surface coated. Each specimen shall have not less than 1.3 
oz/ft2 [0.40 kg/m 2 ] of zinc coating on each surface, calculated 
by dividing the total weight (mass) of zinc on the given surface 
( outside or inside) by the area of the surface coated ( outside or 
inside). 
17.3 Weight (Mass) per Unit Area of Coating Test-The 
weight (mass) per unit area of zinc coating shall be determined 
by stripping tests in accordance with Test Method A90/ A90M. 
17.4 Test Specimens-Test specimens for determination of 
weight (mass) per unit area of coating shall be cut approxi­
mately 4 in. [100 mm] in length. 
17.5 Number of Tests-Two test specimens for the determi­
nation of weight (mass) per unit area of coating shall be taken, 
one from each end of one length of galvanized pipe selected at 
random from each lot of 500 lengths, or fraction thereof, of 
each size. 
17.6 Retests-If the weight (mass) per unit area of coating 
of any lot does not conform to the requirements specified in 
17 .2, retests of two additional pipes from the same lot shall be 
made, each of which shall conform to the specified require­
ments. 
17. 7 If pipe ordered under this specification is to be 
galvanized, the tension, flattening, and bend tests shall be made 
on the base material before galvanizing, if practicable. If 
specified, results of the mechanical tests on the base material 
shall be reported to the purchaser. If it is impracticable to make 
the mechanical tests on the base material before galvanizing, it 
shall be permissible to make such tests on galvanized samples, 
and any flaking or cracking of the zinc coating shall not be 
considered cause for rejection. If galvanized pipe is bent or 
otherwise fabricated to a degree that causes the zinc coating to 
stretch or compress beyond the limit of elasticity, some flaking 
of the coating is acceptable. 
18. Inspection 
18.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry, at all times while work on the contract of the purchaser 
is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's works 
that concern the manufacture of the pipe ordered. The manu­
facturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities to be 
satisfied that the pipe is being furnished in accordance with this 
specification. All tests ( except product analysis) and inspection 
shall be made at the place of manufacture prior to shipment, 
unless otherwise specified, and shall be so conducted as not to 
interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the works. 
19. Rejection 
19.1 The purchaser is permitted to inspect each length of 
pipe received from the manufacturer and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of this specification based upon the inspection 
and test method as outlined in the specification, the length shall 
be rejected and the manufacturer shall be notified. Disposition 
of rejected pipe shall be a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
19.2 Pipe found in fabrication or in installation to be 
unsuitable for the intended use, under the scope and require­
ments of this specification, shall be set aside and the manufac­
turer notified. Such pipe shall be subject to mutual investiga­
tion as to the nature and severity of the deficiency and the 
147

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the purchase order. 
The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test than is provided in the supplementary 
requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, retest and retreatment 
provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. 
Sl. Flattening Test, Seamless Pipe 
Sl.1 A test specimen at least 2½ in. [60 mm] in length shall 
be flattened cold between parallel plates in two steps. During 
the first step, which is a test for ductility, except as allowed by 
S 1.3, S 1.4, and S 1.5, no cracks or breaks on the inside, outside, 
or end surfaces shall be present before the distance between the 
plates is less than the value of H calculated as follows: 
H = (1 +e)tl(e+t!D) 
where: 
H = distance between flattening plates, in. [mm], 
e = deformation per unit length (constant for a given grade 
of steel, 0.09 for Grade A, and 0.07 for Grade B), 
t = specified wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
D = specified outside diameter, in. [mm] 
The H values have been calculated for standard-weight and 
extra-heavy weight pipe from NPS 2V2 to NPS 24 [DN 65 to 
DN 600], inclusive, and are given in Table X2.1. 
Sl.2 During the second step, which is a test for soundness, 
the flattening shall be continued until the test specimen breaks 
or the opposite sides of the test specimen meet. Evidence of 
laminated or unsound material that is revealed during the entire 
flattening test shall be cause for rejection. 
Sl.3 Surface imperfections in the test specimen before 
flattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening 
test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements 
in Section 12. 
S 1.4 Superficial ruptures as a result of surface imperfections 
shall not be cause for rejection. 
Sl.5 For pipe with a D-to-t ratio less than 10, because the 
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the 
inside surface at the 6 and 12 o'clock locations, cracks at such 
locations shall not be cause for rejection. 
Sl.6 One test shall be made on test specimens taken from 
one length of pipe from each lot of each pipe size. A lot shall 
contain no more than one heat, and at the option of the 
manufacturer shall contain no more than 500 lengths of pipe 
(as initially cut after the final pipe-forming operation, prior to 
any further cutting to the required ordered lengths) or 50 tons 
[ 45 Mg] of pipe. 
S 1. 7 If the results of a test for a lot fail to conform to the 
applicable requirements, the lot shall be rejected unless tests of 
additional pipe from the affected lot of double the number 
originally tested are subsequently made and each such test 
conforms to the specified requirements. Only one retest of any 
lot will be permitted. Any individual length of pipe that 
conforms to the test requirements is acceptable. Any individual 
length of pipe that does not conform to the test requirements 
may be resubmitted for test and will be considered acceptable 
if tests taken from each pipe end conform to the specified 
requirements.

Xl. DEFINITIONS OF TYPES OF PIPE 
Xl.1 Type F, Furnace-Butt-Welded Pipe, Continuous-
Welded Pipe-Pipe produced in multiple lengths from 
coiled skelp and subsequently cut into individual lengths, 
having its longitudinal butt joint forge welded by the mechani­
cal pressure developed in rolling the hot-formed skelp through 
a set of round pass welding rolls. 
Xl.2 Type E, Electric-Resistance-Welded Pipe-Pipe pro­
duced in single lengths, or in multiple lengths from coiled 
skelp and subsequently cut into individual lengths, having a 
149 
longitudinal butt joint wherein coalescence is produced by the 
heat obtained from resistance of the pipe to the flow of electric 
current in a circuit of which the pipe is a part, and by the 
application of pressure. 
Xl.3 Type S, Seamless Pipe-Pipe made without a welded 
seam. It is manufactured by hot working steel and, if necessary, 
by subsequently cold finishing the hot-worked tubular product 
to produce the desired shape, dimensions, and properties.

A The minimum test pressure for outside diameters and wall thicknesses not listed shall be computed by the formula given below. The computed test pressure shall be 
used in all cases, except as follows: 
( 1) For specified wall thicknesses greater than the heaviest specified wall thickness listed in this table for the applicable specified outside diameter, the test pressure 
shall be the highest value listed for the applicable specified outside diameter and grade. 
(2) For pipe smaller than NPS 2 [DN 50] with a specified wall thickness less than the lightest specified wall thickness listed in this table for the applicable specified outside 
diameter and grade. 
(3) For all sizes of Grade A and B pipe smaller than NPS 2 [DN 50], the test pressures were assigned arbitrarily. Test pressures for intermediate specified outside 
diameters need not exceed those given in this table for the next larger listed size. 
P=2St!D 
where: 
P minimum hydrostatic test pressure, psi [kPa], 
S 0.60 times the specified minimum yield strength, psi [kPa], 
t specified wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
D specified outside diameter, in. [mm].

TABLE X2.4 Table of Minimum Permissible Wall Thicknesses on Inspection for Pipe Specified Wall Thicknesses 
NoTE 1-The following equation, upon which this table is based, shall be applied to calculate minimum permissible wall thickness from specified wall 
thickness: 
ts X 0.875 = tm 
where: 
t. = specified wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
tm = minimum pennissible wall thickness, in. [mm]. 
The wall thickness is expressed to three [two] decimal places, the fourth [third] decimal place being carried forward or dropped in accordance with 
Practice E29. 
NoTE 2-This table is a master table covering wall thicknesses available in the purchase of different classifications of pipe, but it is not meant to imply 
that all of the walls listed therein are obtainable under this specification.

SA-105 /SA-105M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Carbon Steel Forgings for Piping Applications 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers forged carbon steel piping 
components for ambient- and higher-temperature service in 
pressure systems. Included are flanges, fittings, valves, and 
similar parts ordered either to dimensions specified by the 
purchaser or to dimensional standards such as the MSS, 
ASME, and API specifications referenced in Section 2. Forg­
ings made to this specification are limited to a maximum 
weight of 10 000 lb [ 4540 kg]. Larger forgings may be ordered 
to Specification A266/A266M. Tubesheets and hollow cylin­
drical forgings for pressure vessel shells are not included 
within the scope of this specification. Although this specifica­
tion covers some piping components machined from rolled bar 
and seamless tubular products (see 5.2), it does not cover raw 
material produced in these product forms. 
1.2 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when 
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply 
only when specified individually by the purchaser in the order. 
1.3 Specification A266/ A266M covers other steel forgings 
and Specifications A675/A675M and A696 cover other steel 
bars. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and SI units. However, unless the order specifies the applicable 
"M" specification designation (SI units), the material shall be 
furnished to inch-pound units. The values stated in either SI 
units or inch-pound units are to be regarded separately as 
standard. Within the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. 
The values stated in each system may not be exact equivalents; 
therefore, each system shall be used independently of the other. 
Combining values from the two systems may result in non­
conformance with the standard. 
Norn 1-Toe dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. 
2. Referenced Documents 
2.1 In addition to those reference documents listed in 
Specification A961/A961M, the following list of standards 
apply to this specification:

where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm, %, and 
T = actual thickness of specimen, in. 
this positioning, the test specimen shall be positioned as near as 
possible to the prescribed location. 
8.3 Tension Tests: 
8.3.1 One tension test shall be made for each heat of 
as-forged components. 
8.3.2 One tension test shall be made from each heat-treating 
charge. If more than one heat is included in such a charge, each 
heat shall be tested. 
8.3.2.1 When forgings of different shapes are included in the 
same heat-treating charge, the test specimen shall be obtained 
from the heaviest cross-section of the thickest forging, except 
for hubbed flanges (see 8.3.3). The test specimen shall repre­
sent all forgings from the same heat and heat-treating charge 
whose maximum thicknesses do not exceed the thickness of the 
test forging. 
8.3.2.2 When the heat-treating temperatures are the same 
and the furnaces (either batch or continuous type), are con­
trolled within ±25 °F [±14 °C] and equipped with recording 
pyrometers so that complete records of heat treatment are 
available, then one tension test from each heat is required 
instead of one test from each heat in each heat-treatment 
charge. The test specimen material shall be included with a 
furnace charge. 
8.3.3 Testing shall be performed as specified in Specifica­
tion A961/A961M. The largest feasible round specimen shall 
be used except when hollow cylindrically shaped parts are 
machined from seamless tubulars, When hollow cylindrically 
shaped parts are machined from seamless tubular materials, 
strip tests may be used. The tension test specimen shall be 
obtained from a production forging, or from an integral 
prolongation representative of the hub location of a flange, or 
the heaviest cross section of a fitting, valve, or other part within 
the scope of this specification. 
8.3.4 Forgings too small to permit obtaining a subsize 
specimen of 0.250 in. [6.35 mm] diameter or larger parallel to 
the dimension of maximum working, and produced in equip­
ment unsuitable for the production of a separately forged test 
bar such as an automatic or semi-automatic press, may be 
accepted on the basis of hardness only. One percent of the 
forgings per lot, where a lot is the product from a heat, or, if 
heat treated, the product of a heat per furnace charge, or ten 
forgings, whichever is the lesser number, shall be selected at 
random, prepared, and tested using the standard Brinell test. 
The locations of the indentations shall be at the option of the 
manufacturer but shall be selected to be representative of the 
forging as a whole. One indentation per forging shall be 
required but additional indentations may be made to establish 
the representative hardness. The hardness of all forgings so 
tested shall be 137 to 197 HBW inclusive. 
8.4 Hardness Tests: 
8.4.1 Two hardness tests shall be made for each heat of 
as-forged components. When more than one forging is pro­
duced from each heat, a minimum of two forgings shall be 
tested with one reading from each forging. When only one 
forging is produced, it shall be tested in two locations. 
8.4.2 Except when only one forging is produced, a mini­
mum of two forgings shall be hardness tested per batch or 
continuous run as defined in 8.3.2.2 to ensure that forgings are 
within the hardness limits given in Table 2. When only one 
forging is produced, it shall be hardness tested in two locations 
to ensure it is within the hardness limits given in Table 2. 
166 
8.4.3 Testing shall be as specified in Specification A961/ 
A961M. The purchaser may verify that the requirement has 
been met by testing at any location on the forging, provided 
such testing does not render the forging useless. 
9. Hydrostatic Tests 
9.1 Such tests shall be conducted by the forging manufac­
turer only when Supplementary Requirement S57 in Specifi­
cation A961/A961M is specified. 
10. Retreatment 
10.1 If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform to 
the requirement specified, the manufacturer may heat treat or 
reheat treat the forgings as applicable and repeat the test 
specified in Section 8.

Protection 
11.1 The requirements of Specification A961/A961M apply 
to forgings and finished parts. 
12. Repair by Welding 
12.l Repair of defects by the manufacturer is permissible 
for forgings made to dimensional standards such as those of 
ASME or for other parts made for stock; by the manufacturer. 
Prior approval of the purchaser is required to repair-weld 
special forgings made to the purchaser's requirements. 
12.2 Weld repairs shall be made by a process that does not 
produce undesirably high levels of hydrogen in the welded 
areas. 
12.3 All forgings repaired by welding shall be post-weld 
heat treated between 1100 °F [593 °C] and the lower transfor­
mation temperature for a minimum of ½ h/in. [½ h/25.4 mm] 
of maximum section thickness, or alternatively annealed, 
normalized and tempered, or quenched and tempered. If the 
forging was not previously heat treated, the original tempering 
temperature was exceeded, or the forging was fully heat treated 
in the post weld cycle, then the forging shall be tested in 
accordance with Section 8 on completion of the cycle. 
12.4 The mechanical properties of the procedure­
qualification weldment shall, when tested in accordance with 
Section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
conform with the requirements listed in Table 2 for the thermal 
condition of repair-welded forgings. 
13. Rejection and Rehearing 
13.1 Each forging that develops mJunous defects during 
shop working or application shall be rejected and the manu­
facturer notified. 
14. Certification 
14.1 Identification Marking-For forgings made to specified 
dimensions, when agreed upon by the purchaser, and for 
forgings made to dimensional standards, application of identi­
fication marks as required in Specification A961/A961M shall 
be the certification that the forgings have been furnished in 
accordance with the requirements of this specification. 
14.2 Test Reports-The manufacturer shall also provide the 
following, where applicable: 
14.2.1 Type heat treatment, Section 6, 
14.2.2 Tensile property results, Section 8 (Table 2), report 
the yield strength and tensile strength, in ksi [MPa], elongation 
and reduction in area, in percent; and, if longitudinal strip 
tension specimens are used, report the width of the gauge 
length,

ported results shall be to the same number of significant figures 
as the limits specified in Table 1 for that element. 
14.2.4 Hardness results, Section 8 (Table 2), a minimum of 
two readings, and 
14.2.5 Any supplementary testing required by the purchase 
order. 
15. Product Marking 
15.1 In addition to marking requirements of Specification 
A961/A961M, the following additional marking requirements 
shall apply: 
15.1.1 If the forgings have been quenched and tempered, the 
letters "QT" shall be stamped on the forgings following this 
specification number. 
15.1.2 Forgings repaired by welding shall be marked with 
the letter "W" following this specification number. 
15.1.3 Plugs and bushings furnished to ASME B16.11 
requirements are not required to be marked. Other parts 
ordered with no marking are by agreement between the 
purchaser and manufacturer. 
15.1.4 When agreed upon between the purchaser and manu­
facturer and specified in the order, the markings shall be 
painted or stenciled on the fitting or stamped on a metal or 
plastic tag which shall be securely attached to the fitting. 
15.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 
Specification A961/A961M, bar coding is acceptable as a 
supplemental identification method. The purchaser may 
specify in the order a specific bar coding system to be used. 
The bar coding system, if applied at the discretion of the 
supplier, should be consistent with one of the published 
industry standards for bar coding. If used on small parts, the 
bar code may be applied to the box or a substantially applied 
tag.

Specification for 
Seamless Carbon Steel Pipe for High-Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers seamless carbon steel pipe for 
high-temperature service (Note 1) in NPS Vs to NPS 48 [DN 6 
to DN 1200] (Note 2) inclusive, with nominal (average) wall 
thickness as given in ASME B 36.lOM. It shall be permissible 
to furnish pipe having other dimensions provided such pipe 
complies with all other requirements of this specification. Pipe 
ordered under this specification shall be suitable for bending, 
flanging, and similar forming operations, and for welding. 
When the steel is to be welded, it is presupposed that a welding 
procedure suitable to the grade of steel and intended use or 
service will be utilized. 
Norn 1-It is suggested, consideration be given to possible graphitiza­
tion. 
Norn 2-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) [DN 
(diameter nominal)] has been substituted in this standard for such 
traditional terms as "nominal diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
1.2 Supplementary requirements of an optional nature are 
provided for seamless pipe intended for use in applications 
where a superior grade of pipe is required. These supplemen­
tary requirements call for additional tests to be made and when 
desired shall be so stated in the order. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.4 The following precautionary caveat pertains only to the 
test method portion, Sections 11, 12, and 13 of this specifica­
tion: This standard does not purport to address all of the safety 
concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility 
of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety, 
health, and environmental practices and determine the appli­
cability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
170 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

without developing cracks. When ordered for close coiling, the 
pipe shall stand being bent cold through 180° around a 
cylindrical mandrel, the diameter of which is eight times the 
outside diameter (as shown in ASME B 36.lOM) of the pipe,

whose diameter to wall thickness ratio, where the diameter to 
wall thickness ratio is the specified outside diameter divided by 
the nominal wall thickness, is 7 .0 or less, the bend test shall be 
conducted. The bend test specimens shall be bent at room 
temperature through 180° with the inside diameter of the bend 
being 1 in. [25 mm] without cracking on the outside portion of 
the bent portion. 
Example: For 28 in. [711 mm] diameter 5.000 in. [127 mm] 
thick pipe the diameter to wall thickness ratio = 28/5 = 5.6

13.1 Except as allowed by 13.2, 13.3, and 13.4, each length 
of pipe shall be subjected to the hydrostatic test without 
leakage through the pipe wall. 
13.2 As an alternative to the hydrostatic test at the option of 
the manufacturer or where specified in the purchase order, it 
shall be permissible for the full body of each pipe to be tested 
with a nondestructive electric test described in Section 14. 
13.3 Where specified in the purchase order, it shall be 
permissible for pipe to be furnished without the hydrostatic test 
and without the nondestructive electric test in Section 14; in 
172 
this case, each length so furnished shall include the mandatory 
marking of the letters "NH." It shall be permissible for pipe 
meeting the requirements of 13.1 or 13.2 to be furnished where 
pipe without either the hydrostatic or nondestructive electric 
test has been specified in the purchase order; in this case, such 
pipe need not be marked with the letters "NH." Pipe that has 
failed either the hydrostatic test of 13.1 or the nondestructive 
electric test of 13.2 shall not be furnished as "NH" pipe. 
13.4 Where the hydrostatic test and the nondestructive 
electric test are omitted and the lengths marked with the letters 
"NH," the certification, where required, shall clearly state "Not 
Hydrostatically Tested," and the letters "NH" shall be ap­
pended to the product specification number and material grade 
shown on the certification. 
14. Nondestructive Electric Test 
14.1 As an alternative to the hydrostatic test at the option of 
the manufacturer or where specified in the purchase order as an 
alternative or addition to the hydrostatic test, the full body of 
each pipe shall be tested with a nondestructive electric test in 
accordance with Practice E213, E309, or E570. In such cases, 
the marking of each length of pipe so furnished shall include 
the letters "NOE." It is the intent of this nondestructive electric 
test to reject pipe with imperfections that produce test signals 
equal to or greater than that produced by the applicable 
calibration standard. 
14.2 Where the nondestructive electric test is performed, the 
lengths shall be marked with the letters "NOE." The 
certification, where required, shall state "Nondestructive Elec­
tric Tested" and shall indicate which of the tests was applied. 
Also, the letters "NDE" shall be appended to the product 
specification number and material grade shown on the certifi­
cation.

14.3 The following information is for the benefit of the user 
of this specification: 
14.3.1 The reference standards defined in 14.4 through 14.6 
are convenient. standards for calibration of nondestructive 
testing equipment. The dimensions of such standards are not to 
be construed as the minimum sizes of imperfections detectable 
by such equipment. 
14.3.2 The ultrasonic testing referred to in this specification 
is capable of detecting the presence and location of significant 
longitudinally or circumferentially oriented imperfections; 
however, different techniques need to be employed for the 
detection of such differently oriented imperfections. Ultrasonic 
testing is not necessarily capable of detecting short, deep 
imperfections. 
14.3.3 The eddy current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
imperfections, especially of the short abrupt type. 
14.3.4 The flux leakage examination referred to in this 
specification is capable of detecting the presence and location 
of significant longitudinally or transversely oriented imperfec­
tions; however, different techniques need to be employed for 
the detection of such differently oriented imperfections. 
14.3.5 The hydrostatic test referred to in Section 13 has the 
capability of finding defects of a size permitting the test fluid 
to leak through the tube wall and may be either visually seen 
or detected by a loss of pressure. Hydrostatic testing is not 
necessarily capable of detecting very tight, through-the-wall 
impe1fections or imperfections that extend an appreciable 
distance into the wall without complete penetration. 
14.3.6 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can 
be detected in the specific applications of these examinations is 
directed to discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
14.4 For ultrasonic testing, the calibration reference notches 
shall be, at the option of the producer, any one of the three 
common notch shapes shown in Practice E213. The depth of 
notch shall not exceed 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of 
the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. 
14.5 For eddy current testing, the calibration pipe shall 
contain, at the option of the producer, any one of the following 
discontinuities to establish a minimum sensitivity level for 
rejection: 
14.5.1 Drilled Hole-The calibration pipe shall contain 
depending upon the pipe diameter three holes spaced 120° 
apart or four holes spaced 90° apart and sufficiently separated 
longitudinally to ensure separately distinguishable responses. 
The holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the 
pipe wall, care being taken to avoid distortion of the pipe while 
drilling. Depending upon the pipe diameter the calibration pipe 
shall contain the following hole: 
NPS ON Diameter of Drilled Hole 
s ½ s 15 0.039 in. [1 mm] 
> ½ s 1¼ > 15 s 32 0.055 in. [1.4 mm] 
> 1¼ s 2 > 32 s 50 0.071 in. [1.8 mm] 
> 2 s 5 > 50 s 125 0.087 in. [2.2 mm] 
>5 > 125 0.106 in. [2.7 mm] 
14.5.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool or 
file with a ¼-in. [6-mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe. The notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12 ½ % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. 
14.5.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
tube axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to have a depth not 
exceeding 12 ½ % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
14.5.4 Compatibility-The discontinuity in the calibration 
pipe shall be compatible with the testing equipment and the 
method being used. 
14.6 For flux leakage testing, the longitudinal calibration 
reference notches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a 
radial plane parallel to the pipe axis. For wall thicknesses under 
½ in. [12.7 mm], outside and inside notches shall be used; for 
wall thicknesses equal to and above½ in. [12.7 mm], only an 
outside notch shall be used. Notch depth shall not exceed 
12½ % of the specified wall thickness, or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], 
whichever is greater. Notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25 
mm], and the width shall not exceed the depth. Outside 
diameter and inside diameter notches shall be located suffi­
ciently apart to allow separation and identification of the 
signals. 
14.7 Pipe containing one or more imperfections that pro­
duce a signal equal to or greater than the signal produced by the 
calibration standard shall be rejected or the area producing the 
signal shall be reexamined. 
14.7.1 Test signals produced by imperfections which cannot 
be identified, or produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections 
shall result in rejection of the pipe, unless it is repaired and 
retested. To be accepted, the pipe must pass the same specifi­
cation test to which it was originally subjected, provided that 
the remaining wall thickness is not decreased below that 
pennitted by this specification. The OD at the point of grinding 
may be reduced by the amount so reduced. 
14.7.2 Test signals produced by visual imperfections such as 
those listed below may be evaluated in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 18: 
173 
14.7.2.1 Dinges, 
14.7.2.2 Straightener marks, 
14.7.2.3 Cutting chips, 
14.7.2.4 Scratches, 
14.7.2.5 Steel die stamps, 
14.7.2.6 Stop marks, or 
14.7.2.7 Pipe reducer ripple. 
14.8 The test methods described in this section are not 
necessarily capable of inspecting the end portion of pipes, a 
condition referred to as "end effect." The length of such end 
effect shall be determined by the manufacturer and, when 
specified in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
15. Nipples 
15.1 Nipples shall be cut from pipe of the same dimensions 
and quality described in this specification.

18. Workmanship, Finish and Appearance 
18.1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient num­
ber of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable 
assurance that they have been properly evaluated with respect 
to depth. Exploration of all surface imperfections is not 
required but consideration should be given to the necessity of 
exploring all surface imperfections to assure compliance with 
18.2. 
18.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 12½ % 
of the nominal wall thickness or encroach on the minimum 
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with such 
defects shall be given one of the following dispositions: 
18.2.1 The defect shall be removed by grinding, provided 
that the remaining wall thickness is within the limits specified 
in 16.3. 
18.2.2 Repaired in accordance with the repair welding 
provisions of 18.6. 
18.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect may be cut 
off within the limits of requirements on length. 
18.2.4 Rejected. 
18.3 To provide a workmanlike finish and basis for evalu­
ating conformance with 18.2 the pipe manufacturer shall 
remove by grinding the following noninjurious imperfections: 
18.3.1 Mechanical marks and abrasions-such as cable 
marks, dinges, guide marks, roll marks, ball scratches, scores, 
and die marks-and pits, any of which imperfections are 
deeper than 1/16 in. [l.6 mm]. 
174 
18.3.2 Visual imperfections commonly referred to as scabs, 
seams, laps, tears, or slivers found by exploration in accor­
dance with 18.1 to be deeper than 5 % of the nominal wall 
thickness. 
18.4 At the purchaser's discretion, pipe shall be subjected to 
rejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 18.2 are not 
scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is 
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall 
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
18.5 When imperfections or defects are removed by 
grinding, a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the 
wall thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by 
this specification. The outside diamet()r at the point of grinding 
is permitted to be reduced by the amount so removed. 
18.5.1 Wall thickness measurements shall be made with a 
mechanical caliper or with a properly calibrated nondestructive 
testing device of appropriate accuracy. In case of dispute, the 
measurement determined by use of the mechanical caliper shall 
govern. 
18.6 Weld repair shall be permitted only subject to the 
approval of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification 
A530/A530M. 
18.7 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight. 
19. End Finish 
19.1 The Pipe shall be furnished to the following practice, 
unless otherwise specified.

drawn perpendicular to the axis of the pipe with a root face of 
1/16 ± 1/32 in. [1.6 ± 0.8 mm]. Other bevel angles may be 
specified by agreement between the purchaser and the manu­
facturer. 
20. Sampling 
20.1 For product analysis (see 9.1) and tensile tests (see 
21.1), a lot is the number of lengths of the same size and wall 
thickness from any one heat of steel; of 400 lengths or fraction 
thereof, of each size up to, but not including, NPS 6 [DN 150]; 
and of 200 lengths or fraction thereof of each size NPS 6 [DN 
150] and over. 
20.2 For bend tests (see 21.2), a lot is the number of lengths 
of the same size and wall thickness from any one heat of steel, 
of 400 lengths or fraction thereof, of each size. 
20.3 For flattening tests, a lot is the number of lengths of the 
same size and wall thickness from any one heat of steel, of 400

specimen is less than that given in Table 1 and any part of the 
fracture is more than ¾ in. [19 mm] from the center of the 
gauge length of a 2-in. [50-mm] specimen as indicated by 
scribe scratches marked on the specimen before testing, a retest 
shall be allowed. If a specimen breaks in an inside or outside 
surface flaw, a retest shall be allowed. 
23. Test Specimens and Test Methods 
23.1 On NPS 8 [DN 200] and larger, specimens cut either 
longitudinally or transversely shall be acceptable for the 
tension test. On sizes smaller than NPS 8 [DN 200], the 
longitudinal test only shall be used.

be taken as close to the outer surface as possible and another 
from as close to the inner surface as possible. The specimens 
shall be either½ by½ in. [12.5 by 12.5 mm] in section or 1 by 
½ in. [25 by 12.5 mm] in section with the corners rounded to 
a radius not over 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] and need not exceed 6 in. 
[150 mm] in length. The side of the samples placed in tension 
during the bend shall be the side closest to the inner and outer 
surface of the pipe respectively. 
23.5 All routine check tests shall be made at room tempera­
ture. 
23.6 All tests shall be performed after the heat treatments 
permitted by 5.1 or required by 5.2. 
24. Certification 
24.1 In the required test report(s), in addition to the require­
ments of Specification A530/A530M, the producer or supplier 
shall furnish to the purchaser a chemical analysis report for the 
elements specified in Table 1. 
25. Product Marking 
25.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A530/A530M, the marking shall include heat number, the 
information as per Table 4, an additional symbol "S" if one or 
more of the supplementary requirements apply; the length, OD 
1 %, if ordered as special outside diameter tolerance pipe; ID 
1 %, if ordered as special inside diameter tolerance pipe; the 
schedule number, weight class, or nominal wall thickness; and, 
for sizes larger than NPS 4 [DN 100], the weight. Length shall 
be marked in feet and tenths of a foot [metres to two decimal 
places], depending on the units to which the material was 
ordered, or other marking subject to agreement. For sizes NPS 
1 ½, 1 ¼, 1, and¾ [DN 40, 32, 25, and 20], each length shall 
be marked as prescribed in Specification A530/A530M. These 
sizes shall be bundled in accordance with standard mill practice 
and the total bundle footage marked on the bundle tag; 
individual lengths of pipe need not be marked with footage. 
For sizes less than NPS % [DN 20], all the required markings 
shall be on the bundle tag or on each length of pipe and shall

include the total footage; individual lengths of pipe need not be 
marked with footage. If not marked on the bundle tag, all 
required marking shall be on each length. 
25.2 When pipe sections are cut into shorter lengths by a 
subsequent processor for resale as material, the processor shall 
transfer complete identifying information, including the name 
or brand of the manufacturer to each unmarked cut length, or 
to metal tags securely attached to bundles of unmarked small 
diameter pipe. The same material designation shall be included 
with the information transferred, and the processor's name, 
trademark, or brand shall be added. 
25.3 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 25.1 
and 25.2, bar coding is acceptable as a supplementary identi­
fication method. The purchaser may specify in the order a 
specific bar coding system to be used. 
26. Government Procurement 
26.1 When specified in the contract, material shall be 
preserved, packaged, and packed in accordance with the 
requirements of MIL-STD-163. The applicable levels shall be 
as specified in the contract. Marking for the shipment of such 
material shall be in accordance with Fed. Std. No. 123 for civil 
agencies and MIL-STD-129 or Fed. Std. No. 183 if continuous 
marking is required for military agencies. 
26.2 Inspection-Unless otherwise specified in the contract, 
the producer is responsible for the performance of all inspec­
tion and test requirements specified herein. Except as otherwise 
specified in the contract, the producer shall use his own, or any 
other suitable facilities for the performance of the inspection 
and test requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by 
the purchaser. The purchaser shall have the right to perform 
any of the inspections and tests set forth in this specification 
where such inspections are deemed necessary to ensure that the 
material conforms to the prescribed requirements.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the 
purchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided 
in the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, 
retest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. 
Sl. Product Analysis 
S 1.1 Product analysis shall be made on each length of pipe. 
Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical compo­
sition requirements shall be rejected. 
S2. Transverse Tension Test 
S2. l A transverse tension test shall be made on a specimen 
from one end or both ends of each pipe NPS 8 [DN 200] and 
over. If this supplementary requirement is specified, the num­
ber of tests per pipe shall also be specified. If a specimen from 
any length fails to meet the required tensile properties (tensile, 
yield, and elongation), that length shall be rejected subject to 
retreatrnent in accordance with Specification A530/ A530M and 
satisfactory retest. 
S3. Flattening Test, Standard 
S3 .1 For pipe over NPS 2 [DN 50], a section of pipe not less 
than 2½ in. [63.5 mm] in length shall be flattened cold between 
parallel plates until the opposite walls of the pipe meet. 
Flattening tests shall be in accordance with Specification 
A530/A530M, except that in the formula used to calculate the 
"H" value, the following "e" constants shall be used: 
0.08 for Grade A 
0.07 for Grades B and C 
S3.2 When low D-to-t ratio tubulars are tested, because the 
strain imposed due to geometry is umeasonably high on the 
inside smface at the six and twelve o'clock locations, cracks at 
these locations shall not be cause for rejection if the D-to-t ratio 
is less than ten. 
176 
S3.3 The flattening test shall be made on one length of pipe 
from each lot of 400 lengths or fraction thereof of each size 
over NPS 2 [DN 50], up to but not including NPS 6 [DN 150], 
and from each lot of 200 lengths or fraction thereof, of each 
size NPS 6 [DN 150] and over. 
S3.4 Should a crop end of a finished pipe fail in the 
flattening test, one retest is permitted to be made from the 
failed end. Pipe shall be normalized either before or after the 
first test, but pipe shall be subjected to only two normalizing 
treatments. 
S4. Flattening Test, Enhanced 
S4.l The flattening test of Specification A530/A530M shall 
be made on a specimen from one end or both ends of each pipe. 
Crop ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is 
specified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. 
If a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility 
prior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening 
test requirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat­
ment in accordance with Specification A530/A530M and 
satisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails 
because of a lack of soundness, that length shall be rejected, 
unless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length 
is sound. 
SS. Metal Structure and Etching Test 
S5 .1 The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching 
tests conducted in accordance with the appropriate sections of 
Method E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section 
from one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-106/SA-106M 
and reasonably uniform material free from injurious 
laminations, cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this 
supplementary requirement is specified, the number of tests per 
pipe required shall also be specified. If a specimen from any 
length shows objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, 
subject to removal of the defective end and subsequent retests 
indicating the remainder of the length to be sound and 
reasonably uniform material. 
S6. Carbon Equivalent 
S6.1 The steel shall conform to a carbon equivalent (CE) of 
0.50 maximum as determined by the following formula: 
%Mn %Cr+%Mo+%V %Ni+%Cu 
CE= o/oC+-6-+ 5 + 15 
S6.2 A lower CE maximum may be agreed upon between 
the purchaser and the producer. 
S6.3 The CE shall be reported on the test report. 
S7. Heat Treated Test Specimens 
S7 .1 At the request of the purchaser, one tensile test shall be 
performed by the manufacturer on a test specimen from each 
heat of steel furnished which has been either stress relieved at 
1250°F or normalized at 1650°F, as specified by the purchaser. 
Other stress relief or annealing temperatures, as appropriate to 
the analysis, may be specified by agreement between the 
purchaser and the manufacturer. The results of this test shall 
meet the requirements of Table 1. 
S8. Internal Cleanliness-Government Orders 
S8.1 The internal surface of hot finished ferritic steel pipe

SA-134/SA-134M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Pipe, Steel, Electric-Fusion (Arc)-Welded (Sizes NPS 16 and 
Over) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers electric-fusion (arc)-welded 
straight seam or spiral seam steel pipe NPS 16 and over in 
diameter (inside or outside as specified by purchaser), with 
wall thicknesses up to ¾ in. [19 mm], inclusive. Pipe having 
other dimensions may be furnished provided such pipe com­
plies with all other requirements of this specification. The pipe 
is available in various grades based on the ASTM specification 
ordered (Section 4). 
Note 1-Acceptability for many services may be controlled by codes 
or standards such as those published by the American National Standards 
Institute and American Society of Mechanical Engineers. 
Note 2-For testing methods not specifically covered in this 
specification, reference can be made to Test Methods and Definitions 
A370, with particular reference to Annex A2 on Steel Tubular Products. 
Note 3-A comprehensive listing of standardized pipe dimensions is 
contained in ANSI B 36.10. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. In this 
specification hard or rationalized conversions apply to 
diameter, lengths, and tensile properties. Soft conversion ap­
plies to other SI measurements. 
Note 4-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
1.3 The following caveat pertains specifically to Section 5 
of this specification. This standard does not purport to address 
all of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is 
the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish 
180 
appropriate safety, health, and environmental practices and 
determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to 
use. 
l.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for electric-fusion arc-welded pipe under this 
specification shall contain information concerning as many of 
the following items as are required, to describe the desired pipe 
adequately: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material (electric-fusion (arc)-welded pipe), 
3.1.3 ASTM Specification A134 or A134M and year date, 
3.1.4 Grade (if applicable) of steel from which the pipe shall 
be made (Section 4), 
3.1.5 Size (inside or outside diameter and nominal wall 
thickness), and 
3.1.6 Length (specified or random). 
3.2 The purchaser shall have the option to order additional 
requirements, including, but not limited to the following: 
3.2.1 Specific straightness requirements (see 12.3), 
3.2.2 End finish (Section 14), 
3.2.3 Hydrostatic Test Pressure (Section 11), 
3.2.4 Protective coating (Section 20), 
3.2.5 End use of pipe, and 
3.2.6 Other special or supplementary requirements, if any. 
4. Material 
4.1 The steel from which the pipe is made shall conform to 
Specifications A36/A36M, A283/A283M, A285/A285M, 
AlOll/AlOllM, A1018/A1018M, or to other ASTM specifi­
cations for equally suitable weldable material, as specified. For 
purposes of marking and certification, when required, the pipe 
grade of material shall be established by the A xxx plate 
specification designation and plate grade, when applicable. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 The longitudinal edges of the steel shall be shaped to 
give the most satisfactory results by the particular welding 
process employed. The steel shall then be properly formed and 
may be tacked preparatory to welding. The weld shall be made 
by automatic means (except tack welds) and shall be of 
reasonably uniform width and height for the entire length of the 
pipe. By agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer, manual welding by qualified procedure and 
welders may be used as an equal alternate under this specifi­
cation. 
5.2 All longitudinal seams, spiral seams, and shop girth 
seams shall be butt-welded. 
6. Number of Production Weld Tests 
6.1 One weld test specimen specified in Section 8 shall be 
made from each lot of 3000 ft [900 m] of pipe or fraction 
thereof of each size and wall thickness. 
6.2 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws not associated with the welding, it may be 
discarded and another specimen substituted. 
6.3 Each length of pipe shall be subjected to the hydrostatic 
test specified in Section 11, unless otherwise specified in 11.3. 
7. Retests 
7.1 If any specimen tested in accordance with Section 10 
fails to meet the requirements, retests of two additional 
specimens from the same lot of pipe shall be made, each of 
which shall meet the requirements specified. If any of the 
retests fail to conform to the requirements, test specimens may 
be taken from each untested pipe length at the manufacturer's 
option. Each specimen shall meet the requirements specified, 
or that pipe shall be rejected. 
8. Test Specimens of Production Welds 
8.1 The weld-test specimens for the reduced-section tension 
test shall be taken perpendicularly across the weld and from the 
end of the pipe or, alternatively, from flat test pieces of material 
conforming to the requirements in the specifications used in the 
manufacture of the pipe. The alternative weld-test specimens 
shall be welded with the same procedure and by the same 
operator and equipment, and in sequence with the welding of 
the longitudinal joints in the pipe. The test pieces shall have the 
weld approximately in the middle of the specimen. The 
specimens shall be straightened cold, and shall be tested at 
room temperature. 
8.2 Reduced-section tension-test specimens shall be pre­
pared in accordance with Fig. A2.3 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370, Annex A2 Steel Tubular Products. 
9. Qualification of Welding Procedure 
9.1 The welding procedure shall be qualified in accordance 
with the American Welding Society Standard Qualification 
Procedure 5 or ASME Section IX of the Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code as agreed to between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser using the tests and test values specified in 9.2 and 
9.3. Thicknesses less than 3/s in. [10 mm] shall be qualified for 
each wall thickness of pipe manufactured. Thicknesses 3/s to ¾ • 
in. [10 mm to 19 mm], inclusive, shall be qualified in 3/s-in. 
[10-mm] thickness. 
181 
9.2 Two reduced-section tension specimens (transverse 
weld) made in accordance with Fig. A2.3 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370, with the weld reinforcement removed, shall 
show a tensile strength not less than 100 % of the minimum 
specified tensile strength of the base material used. 
9.3 Two face-bend test specimens shall be prepared in 
accordance with Section A2.5.l.7 of Test Methods and Defi­
nitions A370 and shall withstand being bent 180° in a jig 
substantially in accordance with Fig. A2.15.3 of Test Methods 
and Definitions A370. The bend test shall be acceptable if no 
cracks·or other defects exceeding 1/s in. [3 mm] in any direction 
be present in the weld metal or between the weld and the pipe

=== Page 234 ===

SA-134/SA-134M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
metal after bending. Cracks that originate along the edges of 
the specimens during testing and that are less than ¼ in. [6 
mm] in any direction, shall not be considered. 
10. Tensile Properties of Production Welds 
10.1 Reduced-section tension test specimens required in 
Section 8, taken perpendicularly across the weld with the weld 
reinforcement removed, shall show a tensile strength not less 
than 95 % of the specified minimum strength of the steel. At 
the manufacturer's option, the test may be made without 
removing the weld reinforcement, in which case the tensile 
strength shall be not less than the specified minimum tensile 
strength for the grade of steel used. 
11. Hydrostatic.Test (Note 5) 
11.1 Each length of pipe shall be tested by the manufacturer 
to a hydrostatic pressure that will produce in the pipe wall a 
stress of 60 % of the specified minimum yield point of the steel 
used at room temperature. The pressure shall be determined by 
the following equation: 
P = 2St/D 
where: 
P = minimum hydrostatic test pressure, psi (Note 6) (not to 
exceed 2800 psi [19 MPa]), 
S = 0.60 times the minimum specified yield point of the 
steel used, psi [MPa], 
t = specified wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
D = specified outside diameter, in. [mm]. 
NoTE 5-A hydrostatic sizing operation is not to be considered a 
hydrostatic test or a substitute for it. 
NoTE 6-When the diameter and wall thickness of pipe are such that the 
capacity limits of testing equipment are exceeded by these requirements, 
the test pressures may be reduced by agreement between the purchaser and 
the manufacturer. 
11.2 Test pressure shall be held for not less than 5 s, or for 
a longer time as agreed upon between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
NoTE 7-When agreed upon between the purchaser and the manufac­
turer and so stated on the order, pipe may be tested to one and one half 
times the specified working pressure, except that the maximum test 
pressure shall not exceed 2800 psi [19 MPa] nor shall the maximum fiber 
stress exceed 85 % of specified minimum yield point of steel or to a fiber 
stress that does not exceed 85 % of the specified minimum yield point of 
the steel or 2800-psi [19-MPa] test pressure. 
11.3 When specified in the order, pipe may be furnished 
without hydrostatic testing and each length so furnished shall 
include the mandatory marking of the letters "NH." 
Additionally, the certification, when required, shall state "Not 
Hydrostatically Tested" and the specification number and 
material grade, as shown on the certification, shall be followed 
by the letters "NH." 
12. Permissible Variations in Weights and Dimensions 
12.1 Thickness and Weight-The wall thickness and weight 
for welded pipe under this specification shall be governed by 
the requirements of the specifications to which the steel was 
ordered. 
182 
12.2 Circumference-The outside circumference of the pipe 
shall not vary more than ±0.5 % from the nominal outside 
circumference based upon the diameter specified, except that 
the circumference at ends shall be sized, if necessary, to meet 
the requirements of Section 14. 
12.3 Straightness-Finished pipe shall be commercially 
straight. When specific straightness requirements are desired, 
the order should so state, and the tolerances shall be a matter of 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
12.4 Ovality-Out-of-roundness-The difference between 
major and minor outside diameter shall not exceed 1 %. Closer 
tolerances may be established by agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. Where the D/I' ( outside 
diameter/wall thickness) is over 120, internal bracing should be 
utilized to achieve sizing of ends and ovality shall be by 
agreement between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
13. Lengths 
13.1 Pipe lengths shall be supplied in accordance with the 
following regular practice: 
13.1.1 The lengths shall be as specified on the order with a 
tolerance of±½ in. [13 mm], except that the shorter lengths 
from which test coupons have been cut may also be shipped. 
13.1.2 When random lengths are specified, pipe shall be 
furnished in lengths having a minimum average of 29 ft [9 m] 
with a minimum length of 20 ft [6 m], but not more than 5 % 
may be under 25 ft [8 m]. 
13.2 Pipe lengths containing circumferentially welded joints 
(Note 8) shall be permitted by agreement between the manu­
facturer and the purchaser. Tests of these welded joints shall be 
made in accordance with the procedure tests specified in 
Section 9 and the production weld tests specified in Section 10. 
The number of production weld tests shall be one per each lot 
of 100 joints or fraction thereof, but not less than one for each 
welder or welding operator. 
NoTE 8-Joints are defined for the purpose of this specification as a 
circumferential welded seam lying in one plane, used to join lengths of 
straight pipe. 
14. Ends 
14.1 Pipe shall be furnished with a plain right-angle cut or 
with bevel ends as specified. All burrs at the ends of pipe shall 
be removed. 
14.1.1 Unless otherwise specified, pipe with beveled ends 
shall meet the requirements of ANSI B 16.25. 
14.2 Unless otherwise specified, the outside circumference 
of pipe ends for a distance of not less than 4 in. [100 mm] shall 
not vary more than ± 60 % of the nominal wall thickness of the 
pipe from the nominal outside circumference based on the 
diameter specified, except that the tolerance shall not be less 
than ± 3/16 in. [5 mm]. 
14.3 By agreement between the manufacturer and the pur­
chaser the ends of the pipe may be sized within agreed-upon 
tolerances if necessary to meet the requirements of special 
installations.

INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Steel Pipe 1 
This standard is issued uuder the fixed designation A135/A135M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers two grades of electric­
resistance-welded steel pipe in NPS 2 to NPS 30 [DN 50 to DN 
750] inclusive, with nominal (average) wall thickness up to 
0.500 in. [12.70 mm], inclusive, and in nominal sizes NPS 
¾ to NPS 5 [DN 20 to DN 125] inclusive with nominal 
(average) wall thickness 0.083 in. [2.11 mm] to 0.134 in. [3.40 
mm], depending on size. Pipe having other dimensions (Note 
1) may be furnished provided such pipe complies with all other 
requirements of this specification. The pipe is intended for 
conveying gas, vapor, water or other liquid; only Grade A is 
adapted for flanging and bending (Note 2). The suitability of 
pipe for various purposes is somewhat dependent upon its 
dimensions, properties, and conditions of service, so that the 
purpose for which the pipe is intended should be stated in the 
order. The pipe may be furnished either nonexpanded or cold 
expanded at the option of the manufacturer. When pipe is cold 
expanded, the amount of expansion shall not exceed 1.5 % of 
the outside diameter pipe size. 
NOTE 1-A comprehensive listing of standardized pipe dimensions is 
contained in ASME B36.lOM. 
NOTE 2-This provision is not intended to prohibit the cold bending of 
Grade B pipe. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.3 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

5.1 The steel shall be made by either or both of the 
following processes: basic-oxygen or electric-furnace. 
5.2 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When 
steels of different grades are sequentially strand cast, identifi­
cation of the resultant transition material is required. The 
producer shall remove the transition material by any estab­
lished procedure that positively separates the grades. 
5.3 The pipe shall be manufactured from flat rolled steel in 
individual lengths or in continuous length by electric-resistance 
or electric-induction welding without the addition of extrane­
ous material. 
187

order, the heat analyses shall be reported to the purchaser or a 
representative of the purchaser. 
7. Product Analysis 
7 .1 An analysis may be made by the purchaser on samples 
of pipe selected at random and shall conform to the require­
ments specified in Table 2. Methods and practices relating to 
chemical analysis shall be in accordance with Test Method, 
Practices, and Terminology A751. 
8. Mechanical Properties Requirements 
8.1 Tensile Properties: 
8.1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in Table 1. 
8.1.2 The yield strength shall be determined by the offset 
method utilizing 0.2 % of the gauge length or by the total 
extension under load method using 0.5 % of the gauge length. 
8.1.3 Longitudinal test specimens shall be full-size longitu­
dinal test specimens (see Figure A2.1 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370) or longitudinal strip test specimens (see 
Specimen No. 4 in Fig. A2.3 of Test Methods and Definitions 
A370). 
8.2 The test specimen taken across the weld shall show a 
tensile strength not less than the minimum tensile strength 
specified for the grade of pipe ordered. This test will not be 
required for pipe under NPS 8 [DN 200]. 
9. Flattening Test 
9.1 A specimen at least 4 in. [100 mm] in length shall be 
flattened cold between parallel plates in three steps with the 
weld located either 0° or 90° from the line of direction of force 
as required in 9.2. During the first step, which is a test for 
ductility of the weld, no cracks or breaks on the inside or 
outside surfaces shall occur before the distance between the 
plates is less than two thirds of the original outside diameter of 
the pipe. As a second step, the flattening shall be continued. 
During the second step, which is a test for ductility exclusive 
of the weld, no cracks or breaks on the inside or outside 
surfaces shall occur before the distance between the plates is 
less than one third of the original outside diameter of the pipe 
but is not less than five times the wall thickness of the pipe. 
During the third step, which is a test for soundness, the 
flattening shall be continued until the specimen breaks or the 
opposite walls of the pipe meet. Evidence of laminated or 
unsound material or of incomplete weld that is revealed during 
the entire flattening test shall be cause for rejection. 
9 .2 For pipe produced in single lengths, the flattening test 
specified in 9 .1 shall be made on both crop ends cut from each 
iength of pipe. The tests from each end shall be made 
alternately with the weld at 0° and at 90° from the line of 
direction of force. For pipe produced in multiple lengths, the 
flattening test shall be made on crop ends representing the front 
and back of each coil with the weld at 90° from the line of 
direction of force, and on two intermediate rings representing 
each coil with the weld 0° from the line of direction of force. 
188 
9 .3 Surface imperfections in the test specimen before 
flattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening 
test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements 
in Section 13. 
9 .4 Superficial cracks as a result of surface imperfections 
shall not be cause for rejection. 
10. Hydrostatic Test 
10.1 Except as provided for in 10.3, each length of pipe 
shall be hydrostatically tested at the mill, without leakage 
through the wall, to a pressure calculated from the following 
equation: 
P = 2St/D 
where: 
P = minimum hydrostatic test pressure, psi, [kPa]. The test 
pressure need not exceed 2500 psi [17 200 kPa], 
S = allowable fiber stress 18 000 psi [124 000 kPa] for 
Grade A and 21 000 psi [145 000 kPa] for Grade B. 
This does not prohibit testing at higher pressure at the 
manufacturer's option, 
t = specified wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
D = specified outside diameter, in. [mm]. 
Plain end pipe may be tested at the discretion of the 
manufacturer in single lengths or in multiple lengths. 
10.2 The hydrostatic pressure shall be maintained for not 
less than 5 s. 
10.3 When specified in the order, pipe may be furnished 
without hydrostatic testing, and each length so furnished shall 
include with the mandatory marking the letters "NH." 
Nam 3-This provision is not intended to apply to light wall (Schedule 
10) pipe listed in Table Xl.1. 
10.4 When certification is required by the purchaser and the 
hydrostatic test has been omitted, the certification shall clearly 
state "Not Hydrostatically Tested." The specification number 
and material grade, as shown on the certification, shall be 
followed by the letters "NH." 
11. Nondestructive Examination Reqnirements 
11.1 As an alternate to the hydrostatic test, and when 
accepted by the purchaser, each pipe shall be tested with a 
nondestructive electric test. Except for pipe produced on a 
hot-stretch reducing mill, the weld seam of each length of pipe 
shall be tested with a nondestructive test in accordance with 
Practices E213, E273, E309, or E570. Each length of pipe 
produced on a hot-stretch-reducing mill shall be tested with a 
nondestructive electric test that inspects the full volume of the 
pipe in accordance with Practices E213, E309, or E570. 
11.2 Recognized methods for meeting this test are electro­
magnetic (eddy current) or ultrasonic. 
11.3 The following information is for the benefit of the user 
of this specification: 
11.3.1 The ultrasonic examination referred to in this speci­
fication is intended to detect longitudinal imperfections having 
a reflective area similar to or larger than the reference notch.

=== Page 241 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-135/SA-135M (ASTM A135/A135M) 
The examination may not detect circumferentially oriented 
imperfections of short, deep imperfections. 
11.3.2 The eddy-current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
imperfections, especially of the short, abrupt type. 
11.3.3 The hydrostatic test referred to in Section 10 is a test 
method provided for in many product specifications. This test 
has the capability of finding imperfections of a size permitting 
the test fluid to leak through the tube wall and may be either 
visually seen or detected by a loss of pressure. This test may 
not detect very tight, through-the-wall imperfections or imper­
fections that extend an appreciable distance into the wall 
without complete penetration. 
11.3 .4 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of imperfections that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
11.4 In order to accommodate the various types of nonde­
structive electric testing equipment and techniques in use, the 
calibration pipe shall contain, at the option of the producer, any 
one or more of the following discontinuities to establish a 
minimum sensitivity level for rejection: 
11.4.1 Drilled Hole-A hole not larger than 0.031-in. [0.8-
mm] diameter shall be drilled radially and completely through 
pipe wall, preferably in the weld area, care being taken to avoid 
distortion of the pipe while drilling. 
11.4.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-A notch shall be filed 
or milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the 
longitudinal axis of the pipe preferably in the weld area. Said 
notch shall have a depth not exceeding 12.5 % of the nominal 
wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in., [0.10 mm], whichever 
is greater. 
11.4.3 Longituclinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
pipe axis on the outside surface of the pipe preferably in the 
weld area, to have a depth not exceeding 12.5 % of the nominal 
wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.10 mm], whichever is 
greater. 
11.5 Pipe producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
calibration imperfection shall be rejected. 
12. Dimensions, Weight (Mass), and Permissible 
Variations 
12.1 Weight (Mass)-The weight (mass) of any length of 
pipe other than Schedule 10 shall not vary more than 3.5 % 
under or 10 % over that specified, but the carload weight 
(mass) shall be not more than 1.75 % under the nominal weight 
(mass). The weight (mass) of pipe furnished to Schedule 10 
shall not vary more than ± 10 % from that calculated using the 
weight (mass) per unit length prescribed in Appendix Table 
Xl.1. The weight (mass) of the pipe shall be calculated from 
the relevant equation in ASME B36.10M. 
Note 4-A system of standard pipe sizes has been approved by the 
American National Standards Institute as American National Standard for 
Welded and Seamless Wrought Steel Pipe (ASME B36.lOM). 
12.2 Diameter-The outside diameter shall not vary more 
than ± 1 % from the nominal size specified. 
12.3 Minimum Wall Thickness-The minimum wall thick­
ness at any point shall be not more than 12.5 % under the 
specified wall thickness. 
Note 5-The minimum wall thickness on inspection is shown in Table 
Xl.2 of the Appendix. 
12.4 Lengths: 
12.4.1 Except as allowed in 12.4.2, pipe shall be furnished 
in lengths averaging 38 ft [11.6 m] or over, with a minimum 
length of 20 ft [6.1 m], but no more than 5 % may be under 32 
ft [9.8 m]. Jointers made by welding are permissible. When 
threaded pipe is ordered, jointers shall be made by threaded 
connections and shall not exceed 5 % of the order. 
12.4.2 Unless otherwise specified, Schedule 10 pipe shall be 
between 16 and 22 ft [4.9 and 6.7 m] for a minimum of 90 % 
of the footage furnished, with any balance being shorter 
lengths at least 8 ft [2.4 m] long. 
13. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
13.1 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight and free 
of defects. Surface imperfections in excess of 12.5 % of the 
nominal wall thickness shall be considered defects. 
13.2 End Finish: 
13.2.1 Schedule JO Pipe-Pipe furnished to Schedule 10 
shall be plain end only. All inside and outside cutting burrs 
shall be removed. This generally involves breaking the comers. 
13.2.2 Ends, Plain End Pipe-Unless otherwise specified, 
plain end pipe for use with the Dresser or Dayton type coupling 
shall be reamed both outside and inside sufficiently to remove 
all burrs. Plain end pipe for welding shall be beveled on the 
outside to an angle of 30° with a tolerance of+ 5° and - 0° and 
with a width of flat at the end of the pipe of 1/16 ± ½2 in. [1.6 
± 0.8 mm]. When material is ordered beveled to any other than 
a 30° angle, it should be understood that the angle is to be 
measured from a line drawn perpendicular to the axis of the 
pipe. This means that a greater amount of material is removed 
with a 60° angle than with a 30° angle. Pipe shall be 
sufficiently free from indentations, projections, or roll marks 
for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] from the end of the pipe to 
make a tight joint with the rubber gasket type of coupling. All 
plain end pipe intended for Dresser or Dayton type joints or for 
welding, sizes NPS 10 [DN 250] and smaller in outside 
diameter specified, shall be not more than 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] 
smaller than the outside diameter specified for a distance of 8 
in. [200 mm] from the ends of the pipe and shall permit the 
passing for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] of a ring gauge that has 
a bore 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] larger than the outside diameter 
specified of the pipe. Sizes larger than NPS 10 [DN 250] shall 
be not more than 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] smaller than the nominal 
outside diameter for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] from the end 
of the pipe and shall permit the passing for a distance of 8 in. 
[200 mm] of a ring gauge which has a bore 3/32 in. [2.4 mm] 
larger than the nominal outside diameter of the pipe. 
189 
13.2.3 Ends, Threaded Pipe-Each end of threaded pipe 
shall be reamed to remove all burrs. All threads shall be in 
accordance with the American National Standard Pipe Threads

=== Page 242 ===

SA-135/SA-135M (ASTM A135/A135M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
(Note 6) and cut so as to make a tight joint when the pipe is 
tested at the mill to the specified internal hydrostatic pressure. 
The variation from the standard, when tested with the standard 
working gauge, shall not exceed one and one-half turns either 
way. Pipe shall not be rounded by hammering in order to get a 
full thread. There shall be not more than two black threads for 
¾-in. [19.0-mm] taper among the perfect threads. Black 
threads should not be confused with imperfect threads, such as 
those torn, shaven, or broken. 
Nara 6-A complete description of the American National Standard 
Pipe Threads applicable to pipe, valves, and fittings is contained in ASME 
B1.20.1; also "Screw-Thread Standards for Federal Services, 1942," 
National Bureau of Standards Handbook H 28, January, 1942, the perti­
nent data in both sources being identical. 
13.3 Couplings-Each length of threaded pipe shall be 
provided with one coupling manufactured in accordance with 
Specification A865/ A865M except that the coupling may be 
wrought iron (Note 7). Threads shall be cut so as to make a 
tight joint. Taper-tapped couplings shall be furnished on all 
weights (masses) of threaded pipe NPS 2½ [DN 65] and larger. 
NoTE 7-For sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and smaller, it is commercial 
practice to furnish straight-tapped couplings for standard-weight (mass) 
(Schedule 40) pipe and taper-tapped couplings for extra-strong (Schedule 
80) and double-extra-strong pipe. If taper-tapped couplings are required 
for sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and smaller on standard weight (mass) (Schedule 
40) pipe, line pipe in accordance with Specification 5L of the American 
Petroleum Institute should be ordered, thread lengths to be in accordance 
with ASME B 1.20.1. Taper-tapped couplings for sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and 
smaller in standard weight (mass) may be used on mill-threaded standard 
weight (mass) type of the same size. 
13.4 Protective Coating: 
13.4.1 After the pipe has been subjected to the hydrostatic 
test, and if required by the purchaser, it shall be thoroughly 
cleaned of all dirt, oil, grease, loose scale, and rust; then dried, 
and given a protective coating of the kind and in the manner 
specified by the purchaser. Pipe furnished to Schedule 10 shall 
be normally shipped with a light coating of processing oil. If so 
specified, the pipe can be given a mill coating or a special 
coating. 
14. Weld Repair 
14.1 Welding Repair: 
14.2 Defects in the pipe wall, provided their depth does not 
exceed one third the specified wall thickness, shall be repaired 
by electric welding. Defects in the welds such as sweats or 
leaks, unless otherwise specified, shall be repaired or the piece 
rejected at the option of the manufacturer. Repairs of this 
nature shall be made by completely removing the defect, 
cleaning the cavity, and then electric welding. 
14.3 All repaired pipe shall be retested hydrostatically in 
accordance with Section 10. 
15. Sampling 
15.1 Chemical Analysis: 
15.1.1 Samples for chemical analysis shall be taken in 
accordance with Test Method, Practices, and Terminology 
A751. The number of samples shall be determined as follows: 
NPS 
Under 6 [DN 150] 
6 [DN 150] to 20 [DN 
500], incl 
Over 20 [DN 500] to 
30 [DN 750], incl 
15.2 Tension Test: 
Numbers of Samples Selected 
2 from each lot of 400 pipes or fraction 
thereof 
2 from each lot of 200 pipes or fraction 
thereof 
2 from each lot of 100 pipes or fraction 
thereof 
15.2.1 One longitudinal tension test shall be made on one 
length (Note 8) from each lot of 400 lengths or fraction thereof 
of each size under NPS 8 [DN 200] and one transverse body 
and one transverse weld tension test on one length from each 
lot of 200 lengths or fraction thereof of each size NPS 8 to NPS 
20 [DN 200 to DN 500] and on one length from each lot of 100 
lengths or fraction thereof of each size over NPS 20 to NPS 30 
[DN 500 to DN 750]. When taken from the skelp, the number 
of tests shall be determined in the same manner as when taken 
from the finished pipe. 
NoTE 8-Length is defined as the length as ordered, except that in the 
case of orders for cut lengths shorter than double random, which is defined 
as the length as rolled, prior to cutting to the required short lengths. 
15.3 Flattening Test: 
15 .3 .1 When pipe is produced in single length, the flattening 
test specified in 9.1 shall be made on both crop ends cut from 
each length of pipe. When pipe is produced in multiple lengths, 
flattening tests are required on the crop ends from the front and 
back ends of each coil and on two intermediate rings repre­
senting each coil. 
15.4 Hydrostatic Test: 
15.4.1 Each length of pipe shall be subjected to the hydro­
static test specified in Section 10. 
16. Test, Retest, and Resampling 
16.1 Chemical Analysis: 
190 
16.1.1 If the results of the analysis of either length of pipe 
does not conform to the requirements specified in Section 7, 
analyses of two additional lengths from the same lot shall be 
made, each of which shall conform to the requirements 
specified. 
16.2 Tension Test: 
16.2.1 The test specimens and the tests required by this 
specification shall conform to those described in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370, except that all specimens shall be tested 
at room temperature. 
16.2.2 The longitudinal tension test specimen shall be taken 
from the end of the pipe, or by agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser may be taken from the skelp, 
at a point approximately 90° from the weld, and shall not be 
flattened between gauge marks. The sides of each specimen 
shall be parallel between gauge marks. At the manufacturer 
option, the tension test may be made on full section of pipe. 
16.2.3 Transverse weld test specimens shall be taken with 
the weld at the center of the specimen. Transverse body test 
specimens shall be taken opposite to the weld. All transverse 
test specimens shall be approximately 1 ½ in. [38 mm] wide in 
the gauge length and shall represent the full wall thickness of 
the pipe from which the specimen was cut.

16.2.4 ff any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws not associated with the quality of the steel or the 
welding, it may be discarded and another specimen substituted. 
16.2.5 If the results of the tension tests of any lot do not 
conform to the requirements specified in 9.1, retests of two 
additional lengths from the same lot shall be made, each of 
which shall conform to the requirements specified. 
16.2.6 If the percentage of elongation of any tension test 
specimen is less than that specified in 8.1, and any part of the 
fracture is more than ¾-in. [19.0-mm] from the center of the 
gauge length as indicated by scribe scratches marked on the 
specimen before testing, the specimen may be discarded and 
another substituted. 
16.3 Flattening Test: 
16.3.1 Specimens for flattening tests shall be smooth at the 
ends and free from burrs. 
16.3.2 If any section of the pipe fails to comply with the 
requirements of 9.1, for pipe produced in single lengths, other 
sections may be cut from the same end of the same length until 
satisfactory tests are obtained, except that the finished pipe 
shall not be shorter than 80 % of its length after the initial 
cropping; otherwise, the length shall be rejected. For pipe 
produced in multiple lengths, retests may be cut from each end 
of each individual length in the multiple; such tests shall be 
made with the weld alternately 0° and 90° from the line of 
direction of force. 
16.4 All specimens shall be tested at room temperature. 
17. Inspection 
17 .1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
free entry, at all times while work on the contract of the 
purchaser is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's 
works that concern the manufacture of the material ordered. 
The manufacturer shall afford the inspector, without charge, all 
reasonable facilities to satisfy him that the material is being 
furnished in accordance with this specification. All tests 
( except check analysis) and inspection shall be made at the 
place of manufacture prior to shipment, unless otherwise 
specified, and shall be so conducted as not to interfere 
unnecessarily with the manufacturer's operation. 
18. Rejection 
18.1 Each length of pipe received from the manufacturer 
may be inspected by the purchaser and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of this specification based on the inspection and 
test method as outlined in the specification, the length may be 
rejected and the manufacturer shall be notified. Disposition of 
rejected pipe shall be a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
18.2 Pipe found in fabrication or in installation to be 
unsuitable for the intended use, under the scope and require­
ments of this specification, may be set aside and the manufac­
turer notified. Such pipe shall be subject to mutual investiga­
tion as to the nature and severity of the deficiency and the 
forming or installation, or both, conditions involved. Disposi­
tion shall be a matter for agreement. 
19. Certificate of Compliance 
19.1 When specified in the purchase order, the producer or 
supplier shall furnish to the purchaser a certificate of compli­
ance stating that the pipe has been manufactured, sampled, 
tested and inspected in accordance with this specification 
(including the year of issue) and has been found to meet the 
requirements. 
20. Identification of Material 
20.1 Each length of pipe shall be legibly marked with 
appropriate symbols by stenciling, stamping, or rolling to show 
the manufacturer's name, the size, the specification 
designation, the grade, and the hydrostatic test pressure when 
tested, or the letters "NH" when not tested. 
20.2 In addition to the requirements in 20.1, bar coding is 
acceptable as a supplemental identification method. The pur­
chaser may specify in the order a specific bar coding system to 
be used. 
21. Packaging, Marking, and Loading for Shipment 
21.1 When specified on the purchase order, packaging, 
marking, and loading for shipment shall be in accordance with 
Guide A700. 
21.2 The applicable levels shall be as specified in the 
contract. Marking for shipment of such material shall be in 
accordance with Fed. Std. No. 123 for civil agencies and 
MIL-STD-129 if continuous marking is required for military 
agencies.

~u 11 
INTIIRNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Carbon Steel and Carbon­
Manganese Steel Boiler and Superheater Tubes 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation Al 78/ Al 78M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
electric-resistance-welded tubes made of carbon steel and 
carbon-manganese steel intended for use as boiler tubes, boiler 
flues, superheater flues, and safe ends. 
1.2 This specification covers Grades A, C, and D with 
differing chemical requirements (Section 6 and Table 1), 
differing tensile requirements (Section 9 and Table 2), and 
differing crush and mechanical testing requirements (Sections 
10 and 11). 
NOTE I-Grades C and D tubes are not suitable for safe-ending for 
forge welding. 
1.3 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are ½ to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside 
diameter and 0.035 to 0.360 in. [0.9 to 9.1 mm], inclusive, in 
minimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may 
be furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.4 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.Q15 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.5 Optional supplementary requirements are provided and 
when desired, shall be so stated in the order. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order.

5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 After welding, all tubes shall be heat treated at a 
temperature of 1650°F [900°C] or higher and followed by 
cooling in air or in the cooling chamber of a controlled­
atmosphere furnace. Cold-drawn tubes shall be heat treated 
after the final cold-draw pass at a temperature of 1200°F 
[650°C] or higher. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
6.2 When a grade is ordered under this specification, sup­
plying an alloy grade that specifically requires the addition of 
any element other than those listed in Table 1 is not permitted. 
7. Product Analysis 
7.1 When requested on the purchase order, a product analy­
sis shall be made by the manufacturer or supplier from one tube 
per 100 pieces for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm] and one tube per 
250 pieces for sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under; or when tubes 
are identified by heat, one tube per heat shall be analyzed. The 
chemical composition thus determined shall conform to the 
requirements specified. 
7 .2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be 
made. Both retests, for the elements in question, shall meet the 
requirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot (Note 2) shall be rejected or, at the 
option of the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or tube 
may be individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat-
rolled stock or tubes which do not meet the requirements of the 
specifications shall be rejected. 
NOTE 2-A lot consists of 250 tubes for sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under 
and of 100 tubes for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm], prior to cutting to length. 
8. General Requirements 
8.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A450/A450M unless otherwise provided herein. 
9. Tensile Requirements 
9.1 Grade C and D tubes shall conform to the requirements 
as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. 
Nom 3-Explanatory Note-For purposes of design the following 
tensile properties may be assumed for Grade A tubes: 
Tensile strength, min, ksi [MPa] 47 [325] 
Yield Strength, min, ksl [MPa] 26 [180] 
Elongation In 2 in. or 50 mm, min, % 35 
9.2 Table 3 gives the computed minimum elongation values 
for each 1/32-in. [0.8 mm] decrease in wall thickness. Where the 
wall thickness lies between two values shown above, the 
minimum elongation value shall be determined by the follow­
ing equation: 
E = 48t+ 15.00[E = l.87t+ 15.00] 
where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm,%, and, 
= actual thickness of specimen, in. [mm]. 
10. Crush Test 
10.1 When required by the purchaser, crushing tests shall be 
made on sections of tube 2½ in. [63 mm] in length which shall 
stand crushing longitudinally without cracking, splitting, or 
opening at the weld, as follows: 
Wall Thickness of 
Tubes, In. [mm] 
Height of Crushed Section, in. [mm] 
Grade A Tubes Grade C and D Tubes 
0.135 [3.43] and under % [19] or until outside Crush tests not required 
folds are in contact 
Over 0.135 [3.43] 1 ¼ [32] 
10.2 For tubing less than 1 in. [25.4 mm] in outside 
diameter, the length of the specimen shall be 2½ times the 
outside diameter of the tube. Slight surface checks shall not be 
cause for rejection.

11. Mechanical Tests Required 
11.1 Flattening Test: 
11.1.1 For Grade A, one flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each of two tubes from each lot (Note 2) or 
fraction thereof, and from each 2000 ft [600 m] or fraction 
thereof of safe-end material. 
11.1.2 For Grades C and D, one flattening test shall be made 
on specimens from each of two tubes from each lot (Note 2) or 
fraction thereof. 
11.2 Flange Test: 
11.2.1 For Grade A, one flange test shall be made on 
specimens from each of two tubes from: each lot (Note 2) or 
fraction thereof, and from each 2000 ft [600 m] or fraction

open-hearth, electric-furnace, or basic-oxygen process with the 
option of separate degassing and refining processes in each 
case. 
6.2 The stainless steels shall be melted by one of the 
following processes: ( a) electric-furnace (with the option of 
separate degassing and refining processes); (b) vacuum­
fumace; or ( c) one of the former followed by vacuum or 
electroslag-consumable remelting. Grade F XM-27Cb may be 
produced by electron-beam melting. 
6.3 A sufficient discard shall be made to secure freedom 
from injurious piping and undue segregation. 
6.4 Except as permitted in 6.4.2 and 6.4.3, the material shall 
be forged as close as practicable to the specified shape and size. 
6.4.1 Flanges, elbows, return bends, tees, and header tees 
shall not be machined directly from bar stock. Other parts 
whose longitudinal axis is not parallel to the longitudinal axis 
of the hollow bar or forged or rolled bar shall not be machined 
directly from bar. 
6.4.2 Parts may be machined from hollow bar or forged or 
rolled solution-annealed austenitic stainless steel bar without 
additional hot working provided the longitudinal axis of the 
part is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bar. 
6.4.3 Low alloy, martensitic stainless, ferritic stainless, and 
ferritic-austenitic stainless steel parts, NPS-4 [DN 100] and 
under, may be machined from hollow bar or forged or rolled 
bar, without additional hot working provided the longitudinal 
axis of the part is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bar.

6.5 Except as provided for in 6.4, the finished product shall 
be a forging as defined in the Terminology section of Specifi­
cation A788/A788M. 
7. Heat Treatment 6 
7 .1 After hot working, forgings shall be cooled to a tem­
perature below 1000 °F [538 °C] prior to heat treating in 
accordance with the requirements of Table 1. 
7.2 £ow Alloy Steels and Ferritic and Martensitic Stainless 
Steels-The low alloy steels and ferritic and martensitic 
stainless steels shall be heat treated in accordance with the 
requirements of 7 .1 and Table 1. When more than one heat 
treatment option is listed for a Grade in Table 1, any one of the 
heat treatments listed shall be performed. The selection of the 
heat treatment shall be at the manufacturer's option, unless 
otherwise stated in the purchase order. 
7.2.1 Liquid Quenching-Except as permitted in 7.2.2, for 
F 1, F 2, and F 3, and when agreed to by the purchaser, liquid 
quenching followed by tempering shall be permitted provided 
the temperatures in Table 1 for each grade are used. 
7.2.1.1 Marking-Parts that are liquid quenched and tem­
pered shall be marked "QT." 
7.2.2 Alternatively, Grade F 1, F 2, and F 12, Classes 1 and 
2 may be given a heat treatment of 1200 °F [650 °C] minimum 
after final hot or cold forming. 
7.3 Austenitic and Ferritic-Austenitic Stainless Steels­
Except as permitted by 7 .5, the austenitic and ferritic-austenitic 
stainless steels shall be heat treated and liquid-quenched in 
accordance with the requirements of 7 .1 and Table 1. 
7.3.1 Alternatively, immediately following hot working, 
while the temperature of the forging is not less than the 
minimum solution annealing temperature specified in Table 1, 
forgings made from austenitic grades (except grades F 304H, F 
309H, F 310, F 310H, F 316H, F 316Ti, F 321, F 321H, F 347, 
F 347H, F 348, F 348H, F 45, F35030, and F 56) may be 
individually rapidly quenched in accordance with the require­
ments of Table 1. Ferritic-austenitic grades may be solution 
annealed without cooling below 1000 °F by being re-heated to 
the solution annealing temperature required in Table 1, held for 
a time sufficient to dissolve phases and precipitates which may 
cause a reduction in corrosion or mechanical properties, and 
quenched in accordance with Table 1. 
7.3.2 See Supplementary Requirement S8 if a particular 
heat treatment method is to be employed. 
7.4 Time of Heat Treatment-Heat treatment of forgings 
may be performed before machining. 
7.5 Forged or Rolled Bar-Forged or rolled austenitic 
stainless bar from which cylindrically shaped parts are to be 
machined, as permitted by 6.4, and the parts machined from 
such bar, without heat treatment after machining, shall be 
furnished to the annealing and quenching or rapid-cooling 
6 A solution annealing temperature above 1950 °F [1065 °C] may impair the 
resistance to intergranular corrosion after subsequent exposure to sensitizing 
conditions in F 321, F 321H, F 347, F 347H, F 348, and F 348H. When specified 
by the purchaser, a lower temperature stabilizing treatment or a second solution 
annealing shall be used subsequent to the initial high temperature solution anneal 
(see Supplementary Requirement S10). 
requirements of Specification A484/A484M or this 
specification, with subsequent light cold drawing and straight­
ening permitted (see Supplementary Requirement S3 if anneal­
ing must be the final operation). 
7.6 Hollow Bar-Austenitic stainless hollow bar from 
which cylindrically shaped parts are to b~ machined, as 
permitted by 6.4, and the parts machined from such hollow bar, 
without heat treatment after machining, shall be furnished to 
the annealing and quenching or rapid-cooling requirements of 
Specification A511/ A511M, or this specification, with subse­
quent light cold drawing and straightening permitted (see 
Supplementary Requirement S3 if annealing must be the final 
operation).

8.1 A chemical heat analysis in accordance with Specifica­
tion A961/A961M shall be made and conform to the chemical 
composition prescribed in Table 2. 
8.2 Grades to which lead, selenium, or other elements are 
added for the purpose of rendering the material free-machining 
shall not be used. 
8 .3 Starting material produced to a specification that spe­
cifically requires the. addition of any element beyond those 
listed in Table 2 for the applicable grade of material is not 
perrni tted. 
8.4 Steel grades covered in this specification shall not 
contain an unspecified element, other than nitrogen in stainless 
steels, for the ordered grade to the extent that the steel 
conforms to the requirements of another grade for which that 
element is a specified element having a required minimum 
content. For this requirement, a grade is defined as an alloy 
described individually and identified by its own UNS designa­
tion or Grade designation and identification symbol in Table 2. 
8.5 Product Analysis-The purchaser may make a product 
analysis on products supplied to this specification in accor­
dance with Specification A961/A961M. 
9. Mechanical Properties 
9.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
mechanical properties for the grade ordered as listed in Table 3. 
9.2 Mechanical test specimens shall be obtained from pro­
duction forgings, or from separately forged test blanks pre­
pared from the stock used to make the finished product. In 
eithet case, mechanical test specimens shall not be removed 
until after all heat treatment is complete. If repair welding is 
required, test specimens shall not be removed until after 
post-weld heat treatment is complete, except for ferritic grades 
when the post-weld heat treatment is conducted at least 50 °F 
[30 °C] below the actual tempering temperature. When test 
blanks are used, they shall receive approximately the same 
working as the finished product. The test blanks shall be heat 
treated with the finished product and shall approximate the 
maximum cross section of the forgings they represent. 
9.3 For normalized and tempered, or quenched and tem­
pered forgings, the central axis of the test specimen shall be 
taken at least ¼ T from the nearest surface as-heat-treated,

sented forging. In addition, for quenched and tempered 
forgings, the mid-length of the test specimen shall be at least T 
from all other surfaces as-heat-treated, exclusive of the T 
dimension surfaces. When the section thickness does not 
permit this positioning, the test specimen shall be positioned as 
near as possible to the prescribed location, as agreed to by the 
purchaser and the supplier.

9.3.1 With prior purchase approval, the test specimen for 
ferritic steel forgings may be taken at a depth (t) corresponding 
to the distance from the area of significant stress to the nearest 
heat-treated surface and at least twice this distance (2 t) from 
any second surface. However, the test depth shall not be nearer 
to one treated surface than¾ in. [19 mm] and to the second 
treated surface than 1 ½ in. [38 mm]. This method of test 
specimen location would normally apply to contour-forged

A All values are maximum unless otherwise stated. Where ellipses( ... ) appear in this table, there is no requirement and analysis for the element need not be determined 
or reported. 
8 Niobium and columbium are interchangeable names for the same element and both names are acceptable for use in A01.22 specifications. 
c Grade F 2 was formerly assigned to the 1 % chromium, 0.5 % molybdenum grade which is now Grade F 12. • 
0 The present grade F 5a (0.25 max carbon) previous to 1955 was assigned the identification symbol F 5. Identification symbol F 5 in 1955 was assigned to the 0.15 max 
carbon grade to be consistent with ASTM specifications for other products such as pipe, tubing, bolting, welding fittings, and the like. 
"Applies to both heat and product analyses. 
F For Grade F 22V, rare earth metals (REM) may be added in place of calcium, subject to agreement between the producer and the purchaser. In that case the total amount 
of REM shall be determined and reported. 
0 The ratio of Titanium to Nitrogen shall be ee 3.5. Alternatively, in lieu of this ratio limit, Grade F 23 shall have a minimum hardness of 275 HV (26 HRC, 258 HBW) in 
the hardened condition (see 3.2.1). Hardness testing shall be performed in accordance with 9.6.3, and the hardness testing results shall be reported on the material test 
report (see 18.2.5). 
H Grade F XM-27Cb shall have a nickel plus copper content of 0.50 max%. Product analysis tolerance over the maximum specified limit for carbon and nitrogen shall be 
0.002 %. 
'Grade F 316Ti shall have a titanium content not less than five times the carbon plus nitrogen content and not more than 0.70 %. 
J Grade F 321 shall have a titanium content of not less than five times the carbon plus nitrogen content and not more than 0.70 %. 
KGrade F 321H shall have a titanium content of not less than four times the carbon plus nitrogen content and not more than 0.70 %. 
L Grades F 347 and F 348 shall have a niobium (columbium) content of not less than ten times the carbon content and not more than 1.1 O %. 
MGrades F 347H and F 348H shall have a niobium (columbium) content of not less than eight times the carbon content and not more than 1.10 %. 
N Grade F 347LN, Grade F 347LNCuB, and Grade F 317LNCb shall have a niobium (columbium) content of not less than 15 times the carbon content.

R The method of analysis for nitrogen shall be a matter of agreement between purchaser and manufacturer. 
parts, or parts with thick cross-sectional areas where ¼ T x T 
testing (see 9.3) is not practical. Sketches showing the exact 
test locations shall be approved by the purchaser when this 
method is used. 
9.3.2 Metal Buffers-The required distances from heat­
treated surfaces may be obtained with metal buffers instead of 
integral extensions. Buffer material may be carbon or low-alloy 
steel, and shall be joined to the forging with a partial 
penetration weld that seals the buffered surface. Specimens 
shall be located at V2-in. [13-mm] minimum from the buffered 
surface of the forging. Buffers shall be removed and the welded 
areas subjected to magnetic particle test to ensure freedom 
from cracks unless the welded areas are completely removed 
by subsequent machining. 
9 .4 For annealed low alloy steels, ferritic stainless steels, 
and martensitic stainless steels, and also for austenitic and 
ferritic-austenitic stainless steels, the test specimen may be 
taken from any convenient location. 
9.5 Tension Tests: 
9.5.l Low Alloy Steels and Ferritic and Martensitic Stain­
less Steels-One tension test shall be made for each heat in 
each heat treatment charge. 
9.5.1.1 When the heat-treating cycles are the same and the 
furnaces (either batch or continuous type) are controlled within 
±25 °F [ ± 14 °C] and equipped with recording pyrometers so 
that complete records of heat treatment are available, then only 
one tension test from each heat of each forging type (see Note 
1) and section size is required, instead of one test from each 
heat in each heat-treatment charge. 
NoTE !-"Type" in this case is used to describe the forging shape such 
as a flange, ell, tee, and the like. 
9.5.2 Austenitic and Ferritic-Austenitic Stainless Steel 
Grades-One tension test shall be made for each heat. 
9.5.2.1 When heat treated in accordance with 7.1, the test 
blank or forging used to provide the test specimen shall be heat 
treated with a finished forged product. 
9.5.2.2 When the alternative method in 7.3.1 is used, the test 
blank or forging used to provide the test specimen shall be 
forged and quenched under the same processing conditions as 
the forgings they represent. 
220 
9.5.3 Testing shall be performed as specified in Specifica­
tion A961/A961M using the largest feasible of the round 
specimens. 
9.6 Hardness Tests: 
9.6.1 Except when only one forging is produced, a m1m­
mum of two pieces per batch or continuous run as defined in 
9.6.2 shall be hardness tested as specified in Specification 
A961/A961M to ensure that the forgings are within the 
hardness limits given for each grade in Table 3. The purchaser

may verify that the requirement has been met by testing at any 
location on the forging provided such testing does not render 
the forging useless. 
9.6.2 When the reduced number of tension tests permitted 
by 9 .5 .1.1 is applied, additional hardness tests shall be made on 
forgings or samples, as defined in 9.2, scattered throughout the 
load (see Note 2). At least eight samples shall be checked from 
each batch load, and at least one check per hour shall be made 
from a continuous run. When the furnace batch is less than 
eight forgings, each forging shall be checked. If any check falls 
222 
outside the prescribed limits, the entire lot of forgings shall be 
reheat treated and the requirements of 9.5.1 shall apply. 
NoTE 2-The tension test required in 9.5.1 is used to determine material 
capability and conformance in addition to verifying the adequacy of the 
heat-treatment cycle. Additional hardness tests in accordance with 9.6.2 
are required when 9.5.1.1 is applied to ensure the prescribed heat-treating 
cycle and uniformity throughout the load. 
9.6.3 When the alternative to the Ti/N ratio limit for F 23 is 
applied, (see Note Pin Table 2), a minimum of two pieces per 
batch or continuous run as defined in 9.6.2 shall be hardness

The area producing the signal may be reexamined. 
13.4.2 Such forgings shall be rejected if the test signals were 
produced by impetfections that cannot be identified or were 
produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. Such forgings 
may be repaired. To be accepted, a repaired forging shall pass 
the same nondestructive test by which it was rejected, and it 
shall meet the minimum wall thickness requirements of this 
specification and the purchase order. 
13.4.3 If the test signals were produced by visual imperfec­
tions such as scratches, surface roughness, dings, tooling 
marks, cutting chips, steel die stamps, or stop marks, the 
forging is permitted to be accepted based upon visual exami­
nation provided that the depth of the imperfection is less than 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness, 
whichever is the greater. 
13.5 Treatment of Impe,fections Found by Magnetic Par­
ticle or Liquid Penetrant Examination: 
13.5.1 Defects shall be completely removed prior to weld 
repair by chipping or grinding to sound metal. Removal of

penetrant inspection in accordance with Test Method E165/ 
E165M. 
13.5.2 Rejected forgings may be reconditioned and retested, 
provided that the wall thickness is not decreased to less than 
that required by this specification and the purchase order. The 
outside diameter at the point of grinding may be reduced by the 
amount so removed. To be accepted, retested forgings shall 
meet the test requirement.

or High Pressure Service and Other Special Purpose 
Applications 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers alloy and stainless steel bolt­
ing materials and bolting components for pressure vessels, 
valves, flanges, and fittings for high temperature or high 
pressure service, or other special purpose applications. See 
Specification A962/A962M for the definition of bolting. Bars 
and wire shall be hot-wrought and may be further processed by 
centerless grinding or by cold drawing. Austenitic stainless 
steel may be carbide solution treated or carbide solution treated 
and strain-hardened. When strain hardened austenitic stainless 
steel is ordered, the purchaser should take special care to 
ensure that Appendix XI is thoroughly understood. 
1.2 Several grades are covered, including ferritic steels and 
austenitic stainless steels designated B5, BS, and so forth. 
Selection will depend upon design, service conditions, me­
chanical properties, and high temperature characteristics. 
1.3 The following referenced general requirements are in­
dispensable for application of this specification: Specification 
A962/A962M. 
Norn 1-The committee formulating this specification has included 
several steel types that have been rather extensively used for the present 
purpose. Other compositions will be considered for inclusion by the 
committee from time to time as the need becomes apparent. 
Norn 2-For grades of alloy-steel bolting suitable for use at the lower 
range of high temperature applications, reference should be made to 
Specification A354. 
Norn 3-For grades of alloy-steel bolting suitable for use in low 
temperature applications, reference should be made to Specification 
A320/A320M. 
1.4 Nuts for use with bolting are covered in Section 13. 
1.5 Supplementary Requirements are provided for use at the 
option of the purchaser. The supplementary requirements shall 
apply only when specified in the purchase order or contract. 
1.6 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units; however, unless the purchase order or contract 
specifies the applicable M specification designation (SI units), 
the inch-pound units shall apply. 
1.7 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the

AValues are maximums unless a range or a minimum is indicated. Where ellipses appear in this table, there is no requirement and the element need not be detennined or reported. The intentional addition of Bi, Se, 
Te, and Pb is not permitted. 
sProduct Analysis-Individual detenninations sometimes vary from the specified limits as shown in the tables. The several determinations of any individual element in a heat may not vary both above and below the 
specified range. Product variation limits are over for maximums, over or under for ranges, and under for minimums, unless otherwise indicated. 
°Typical steel compositions used for this grade include 4140, 4142, 4145, 4140H, 4142H, and 4145H. 
°For bar sizes over 3½ in. (90 mm], inclusive, the carbon content may be 0.50 % max. For the B7M grade, a minimum carbon of 0.28 % is pennitted, provided that the required tensile properties are met in the section

6.1.2 Use of water quenching is prohibited for any ferritic 
grade when heat treatment is performed after heading or 
threading. 
6.1.3 Except as permitted below for B6X; bolting material 
that is subsequently cold drawn for dimensional control shall 
be stress-relieved after cold drawing. The minimum stress­
relief temperature shall be within not more than 100 °F [55 °C] 
below the tempering temperature. Tests for mechanical prop­
erties shall be performed after stress relieving. 
6.1.4 B6 and B6X shall be held at the tempering tempera­
ture for a minimum time of 1 h. B6X bolting material may be 
furnished in the as-rolled-and-tempered condition. Cold works 
ing after heat treatment is permitted for B6X material provided 
the final hardness meets the requirements of Tables 2 and· 3. 
6.1.5 B7 and B7M shall be heat treated by quenching in a 
liquid medium and tempering. For B7M bolting components, 
such as bolts, studs, or screws, the final heat treatment, which 
may be the tempering operation if conducted at 1150 °F [620 
0 C] minimum, shall be done after all machining and forming 
operations, including thread rolling and any type of cutting. 
Surface preparation for hardness testing, nondestructive 
evaluation, or ultrasonic bolt tensioning is permitted. 
6.1.5.1 Unless otherwise specified, bolting material for 
Grade B7 may be heat treated by the Furnace, the Induction or 
the Electrical Resistance method. 
Norn 4--Stress-relaxation properties may vary from heat lot to heat lot 
or these properties may vary from one heat-treating method to another. 
The purchaser may specify Supplementary Requirement S8, when stress­
relaxation testing is desired. 
6.1.6 Bolting material Grade B16 shall be heated to a 
temperature range from 1700 to 1750 °F [925 to 955 °C] and 
oil quenched. The minimum tempering temperature shall be as 
specified in Tables 2 and 3. 
6.2 Austenitic Stainless Steels: 
6.2.1 All austenitic stainless steels shall receive a carbide 
solution treatment (see 6.2.2 - 6.2.5 for specific requirements 
for each class). Classes 1, lB, IC (Grades B8R and B8S only), 
2, 2B, and 2C can apply to bar, wire, and finished bolting 
components. Class lA (all grades) and Class IC (grades B8RA 
and B8SA only) can apply to finished bolting components. 
Class ID applies only to bar and wire and finished bolting 
components that are machined directly from Class ID bar or 
wire without any subsequent hot or cold working. 
6.2.2 Classes I and JB, and Class JC Grades B8R and 
BBS-After rolling of the bar, forging, or heading, whether 
done hot or cold, bolting material shall be heated from ambient 
temperature and held a sufficient time at a temperature at which 
the chromium carbide will go into solution and then shall be 
cooled at a rate sufficient to prevent the precipitation of the 
carbide. 
6.2.3 Class JD-Rolled or forged Grades B8, B8M, B8P, 
B8LN, B8MLN, B8CLNCuB, B8N, B8MN, B8R, and B8S bar 
shall be cooled rapidly immediately following hot working 
while the temperature is above 1750 °F [955 °C] so that grain 
boundary carbides remain in solution. Class ID shall be 
restricted to applications at temperatures less than 850 °F [455 
oq, 
6.2.4 Class IA and Class IC Grades B8RA and BBSA­
Finished bolting components shall be carbide solution treated 
after all rolling, forging, heading, and threading operations are 
complete. This designation does not apply to starting material 
such as bar. Components shall be heated from ambient tem­
perature and held a sufficient time at a temperature at which the 
chromium carbide will go into solution and then shall be 
cooled at a rate sufficient to prevent the precipitation of the 
carbide. 
6.2.5 Classes 2, 2B, and 2C-Bolting material shall be 
carbide solution treated by heating from ambient temperature 
and holding a sufficient time at a temperature at which the 
chromium carbide will go into solution and then cooling at a 
rate sufficient to prevent the precipitation of the carbide. 
Following this treatment the bolting material shall then be 
strain hardened to achieve the required properties. 
Norn 5-Heat treatment follqwing operations performed on a limited 
portion of the product, such as heading, may result in non-uniform grain 
size and mechanical properties through the section affected.

8.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the 
manufacturer to determine the percentages of the elements 
specified in Section 7. The chemical composition thus deter­
mined shall be reported to the purchaser or the purchaser's 
representative, and shall conform to the requirements specified 
in Section 7. Should the purchaser deem it necessary· to have 
the transition zone of two heats sequentially cast discarded, the 
purchaser shall invoke Supplementary Requirement S3 of 
Specification A 788/ A 788M. 
9. Mechanical Properties 
9.1 Tensile Properties: 
9.1.1 Requirements-Bolting material as represented by the 
tension specimens shall conform to the requirements pre­
scribed in Tables 2 and 3 at room temperature after heat 
treatment. Stainless strain hardened bolting components (Class 
2, 2B, and 2C) shall be tested full size after strain hardening to 
determine tensile strength and yield strength and shall conform 
to the requirements prescribed in Tables 2 and 3. In cases 
where tensile testing equipment of sufficient capacity is not 
available, stainless strain hardened bolting components greater 
than 1.500 in. diameter may be tested using machined speci­
men. Should the results of full size tests conflict with results of 
tension specimen tests, full size test results shall prevail. 
9.1.2 Full Size Bolting Components, Wedge Tensile 
Testing-When applicable, see 12.1.3, headed components 
shall be wedge tested full size. The minimum full size load 
applied (lbf or kN) for individual sizes shall be as follows:

where: 
w = 
Ts = 
At = 
minimum wedge tensile load without fracture, 
tensile strength specified in ksi or MPa in Tables 2 and 
3, and 
stress area of the thread section, square inches or square 
millimetres, as shown in the Cone Proof Load Tables in 
Specification A962/A962M. 
9.2 Hardness Requirements: 
9.2.1 The hardness shall conform to the requirements pre­
scribed in Tables 2 and 3. Hardness testing shall be performed 
in accordance with either Specification A962/ A962M or with 
Test Methods F606/F606M. 
9.2.2 Grade B7M-The maximum hardness of the grade 
shall be 235 HBW or 99 HRB. The minimum hardness shall 
not be less than 200 HBW or 93 HRB. Conformance to this 
hardness shall be ensured by testing the hardness of each stud 
or bolt by Brinell or Rockwell B methods in accordance with 
9 .2.1. The use of 100 % electromagnetic testing for hardness as 
an alternative to 100 % indentation hardness testing is permis­
sible when qualified by sampling using indentation hardness 
testing. Each lot tested for hardness electromagnetically shall 
be 100 % examined in accordance with Practice E566. Follow­
ing electromagnetic testing for hardness, a random sample of a 
minimum of 100 pieces of each heat of steel in each lot (as 
defined in 12.1.1) shall be tested by indentation hardness 
methods. All samples must meet hardness requirements to 
permit acceptance of the lot. If any one sample is outside of the 
specified maximum or minimum hardness, the lot shall be 
rejected and either reprocessed and resampled or tested 100 % 
by indentation hardness methods. 
9.2.2.l Surface preparation for indentation hardness testing 
shall be in accordance with Test Methods E18. Hardness tests 
shall be performed on the end of the bolt or stud. When this is 
impractical, the hardness test shall be performed elsewhere. 
10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
10.1 Bolts, screws, studs, and stud bolts shall be pointed and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. Points shall be flat and 
chamfered or rounded at option of the manufacturer. Length of 
point on studs and stud bolts shall be not less than one nor more 
than two complete threads as measured from the extreme end 
parallel to the axis. Length of studs and stud bolts shall be 
measured from first thread to first thread. 
10.2 Unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, bolt 
heads shall be in accordance with the dimensions of ASME 
Bl8.2.1 or ASME B18.2.3.3M. Unless otherwise specified in 
the purchase order, the Heavy Hex Screws Series should be 
used for nominal body diameters of l ¼ in. [30 mm] and less. 
For larger sizes, the Heavy Hex Screw Series should be used, 
except the maximum body diameter and radius of fillet may be 
the same as for the Heavy Hex Bolt Series. The body diameter 
and head fillet radius for sizes of Heavy Hex Cap Screws and 
Bolts that are not shown in their respective tables in ASME 
B18.2.l or ASME B18.2.3.3M may be that shown in the 
corresponding Hex Cap Screw and Bolt Tables respectively. 
Socket head screws or bolts shall be in accordance with ASME 
B18.3 or ASME B18.3.1M. 
11. Retests 
11.1 If the results of the mechanical tests of any test lot do 
not conform to the requirements specified, the manufacturer 
may retreat such lot not more than twice, in which case two 
additional tension tests shall be made from such lot, all of 
which shall conform to the requirements specified. 
12. Test Specimens 
12.1 Number of Tests-For heat-treated bars, one tension 
test shall be made for each diameter of each heat represented in 
each tempering charge. When heat treated without interruption 
in continuous furnaces, the material in a lot shall be the same 
heat, same prior condition, same size, and subjected to the 
same heat treatment. Not fewer than two tension tests are 
required for each lot containing 20 000 lb [9000 kg] or less. 
Every additional 10 000 lb [4500 kg] or fraction thereof 
requires one additional test. 
12. l.1 For studs, bolts, screws, and so forth, one tension test 
shall be made for each diameter of each heat involved in the 
lot. Each lot shall consist of the following: 
Diameter, in. [mm] 
11/s [30] and under 
Over 11/s (30] to 1¾ (42], incl 
Over 1¾ (42] to 2½ (64], incl

APPENDIXES 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. STRAIN HARDENING OF AUSTENITIC STEELS 
Xl.1 Strain hardening is the increase in strength and hard­
ness that results from plastic deformation below the recrystal-. 
lization temperature (cold work). This effect is produced in 
austenitic stainless steels by reducing oversized bars or wire to 
the desired final size by cold drawing or other process. The 
degree of strain hardening achievable in any alloy is limited by 
its strain hardening characteristics. In addition, the amount of 
strain hardening that can be produced is further limited by the 
variables of the process, such as the total amount of cross­
section reduction, die angle, and bar size. In large diameter 
bars, for example, plastic deformation will occur principally in 
the outer regions of the bar so that the increased strength and 
hardness due to strain hardening is achieved predominantly 
near the surface of the bar. That is, the smaller the bar, the 
greater the penetration of strain hardening. 
Xl .2 Thus, the mechanical properties of a given strain 
hardened bolting component are dependent not just on the 
alloy, but also on the size of bar from which it is machined. The 
minimum bar size that can be used, however, is established by 
the configuration of the component so that the configuration 
can affect the strength of the componoent. 
Xl.3 For example, a stud of a particular alloy and size may 
be machined from a smaller diameter bar than a bolt of the 
same alloy and size because a larger diameter bar is required to 
accommodate the head of the bolt. The stud, therefore, is likely 
to be stronger than the same size bolt in a given alloy. 
X2. COATINGS AND APPLICATION LIMITS 
X2.1 Use of coated bolting components at temperatures 
above approximately one-half the melting point (Fahrenheit or 
Celsius) of the coating is not recommended unless consider­
ation is given to the potential for liquid and solid metal 
embrittlement, or both. The melting point of elemental zinc is 
approximately 780 °F [415 °C]. Therefore, application of 
246 
zinc-coated bolting components should be limited to tempera­
tures less than 390 °F [210 °C]. The melting point of cadmium 
is approximately 600 °F [320 °C]. Therefore, application of 
cadmium-coated bolting components should be limited to 
temperatures less than 300 °F [160 °C].

Specification for 
Carbon Steel, Alloy Steel, and Stainless Steel Nuts for Bolts 
for High Pressure or High Temperature Service, or Both 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers a variety of carbon, alloy, and 
martensitic stainless steel nuts in the size range ¼ through 4 in. 
and metric M12 through MlO0 nominal. It also covers auste­
nitic stainless steel nuts in the size range ¼ in. and Ml2 
nominal and above. These nuts are intended for high-pressure 
or high-temperature service, or both. Grade substitutions with­
out the purchaser's permission are not allowed. 
1.2 Bars from which the nuts are made shall be hot-wrought. 
The material may be further processed by centerless grinding 
or by cold drawing. Austenitic stainless steel may be solution 
annealed or annealed and strain-hardened. When annealed and 
strain hardened austenitic stainless steel is ordered in accor­
dance with Supplementary Requirement S 1, the purchaser 
should take special care to ensure that 8.2.2, Supplementary 
Requirement Sl, and Appendix Xl are thoroughly understood. 
1.3 Supplementary requirements of an optional nature are 
provided. These shall apply only when specified in the inquiry, 
contract, and order. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. Within the text, the SI units are shown in 
brackets. 
248 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

APPENDIXES 
(Nonmandatory Information) 
Xl. STRAIN HARDENING OF AUSTENITIC STEELS 
Xl.1 Strain hardening is the increase in strength and hard­
ness that results from plastic deformation below the recrystal­
lization temperature (cold work). This effect is produced in 
austenitic stainless steels by reducing oversized bars to the 
desired final size by cold drawing or other process. The degree 
of strain hardening achievable in any alloy is limited by its 
strain hardening characteristics. In addition, the amount of 
strain hardening that can be produced is further limited by the 
variables of the process, such as the total amount of cross-
section reduction, die angle and bar size. In large diameter bars, 
for example, plastic deformation will occur principally in the 
outer regions of the bar, so that the increased strength and 
hardness due to strain hardening is achieved predominantly 
near the surface of the bar. That is, the smaller the bar, the 
greater the penetration of strain hardening. Thus, the mechani­
cal properties of a given strain hardened bolting component are 
dependent not just on the alloy, but also on the size of bar from 
which it is machined. 
X2. COATINGS AND APPLICATION LIMITS 
X2.l Use of coated bolting components at temperatures 
above approximately one-half the melting point (Fahrenheit or 
Celsius) of the coating is not recommended unless consider­
ation is given to the potential for liquid and solid metal 
embrittlement, or both. The melting point of elemental zinc is 
approximately 780 °F [415 °C]. Therefore, application of zinc 
coated bolting components should be limited to temperatures 
less than 390 °F [210 °C]. The melting point of cadmium is 
approximately 600 °F [320 °C]. Therefore, application of 
cadmium coated bolting components should be limited to 
temperatures less than 300 °F [160 °C].

Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Nickel 
1. Scope 
l.l This specification covers nickel-alloy steel plates in­
tended primarily for welded pressure vessels. 
1.2 Plates under this specification are available with four 
strength levels and two nickel compositions as follows: 
Grade Nominal Nickel Yield Strength, min, Tensile Strength, 
Content% ksi [MPa] min, ksi [MPa] 
A 2.25 37 [255] 65 [450] 
B 2.25 40 [275] 70 [485] 
D 3.50 37 [255] 65 [450] 
E 3.50 40 [275] 70 [485] 
F 3.50 
2 in. [50 mm] and under 55 [380] 80 [550] 
Over 2 in. [50 mm] 50 [345] 75 [515] 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents. Therefore, each system must 
be nsed independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with this specifi­
cation. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Molybdenum 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers molybdenum-alloy steel 
plates, intended particularly for welded boilers and other 
pressure vessels. 
1.2 Plates under this specification are available in three 
grades having different strength levels as follows: 
Grade Tensile Strength, ksi [MPa] 
A 65-85 [450-585] 
B 70-90 [485-620] 
C 75-95 [515-655] 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with this specifi­
cation. 
l .5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
• 3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/ A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.3 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates 
produced from coil means plates that have been cut to 
individual lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or 
is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of 
coils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, 
leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, 
heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for 
shipment, and certification. 
Norn 1-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat 
treatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are reported for 
each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plates from coil 
are described in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Manufacture

including safe ends (see Note 1), arch and stay tubes, and 
superheater tubes. 
NoTE 1-This type is not suitable for safe ending by forge welding. 
1.2 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are½ in. to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside 
diameter and 0.035 to 0.500 in. [0.9 to 12.7 mm], inclusive, in 
minimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may 
be furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.4 This specification covers grades A-1 and C of Seamless 
Medium-Carbon Boiler and Superheater Tubes with different 
chemical and tensile requirements. (Table 1, Table 3, and 
Section 11.) 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

7 .1 If pickling or shot blasting or both are required, this 
shall be specifically stated in the order. 
8. Chemical Composition 
8.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
8.2 When a grade is ordered under this specification, sup­
plying an alloy grade that specifically requires the addition of 
any element other than those listed for the ordered grade in 
Table 1 is not permitted. 
9. Product Analysis 
9.1 When requested on the purchase order, a product analy­
sis shall be made by the supplier from one tube or billet per 
heat. The chemical composition thus determined shall conform 
to the requirements specified. 
9.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional billets or tubes shall be made. Both retests for 
the elements in question shall meet the requirements of the 
specification; otherwise, all remaining material in the heat or 
lot (see Note 2) shall be rejected or, at the option of the 
producer, each billet or tube may be individually tested for 
acceptance. Billets or tubes which do not meet the require­
ments of the specification shall be rejected. 
Now 2-For flattening and flaring requirements, the term "lot" applies 
to all tubes prior to cutting of the same nominal size and wall thickness 
which are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment 
is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the same 
size and from the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, the 
number of tubes of the same size and from the same heat in a lot shall be 
determined from the size of the tubes as prescribed in Table 2. 
NoTE 3-For tensile and hardness test requirements, the term "lot" 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall 
thickness which are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
the same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, a lot shall 
include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the same furnace 
at the same temperature, time at heat, and furnace speed. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in Table 3. 
10.2 Table 4 gives the computed minimum elongation 
values for each 1/32-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. 
Where the wall thickness lies between two values shown 
above, the minimum elongation value shall be determined by 
the following equation: 
E = 48t+ 15.00 [ E = l.87t+ 15.00] 
where: 
E elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm, %, and 
= actual thiclmess of specimen, in. [mm]. 
11. Hardness Requirements 
11.1 The tubes shall have a hardness not exceeding the 
following: 79 HRBW or 143 HBW for Grade A-1, 89 HRBW 
or 179 HBW for Grade C. 
12. Mechanical Tests Required 
12.1 Tension Test-One tension test shall be made on a 
specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall 
be made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes (see Note 3). 
12.2 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of one finished tube from each lot 
(see Note 2), but not the one used for the flaring test. Tears or 
breaks occurring at the 12 or 6 o'clock positions on Grade C 
tubing with sizes of 2.375 in. [60.3 mm] in outside diameter 
and smaller shall not be considered a basis for rejection. 
12.3 Flaring Test-One flaring test shall be made on speci­
mens from each end of the one finished tube from each lot (see 
Note 2), but not the one used for the flattening test. 
12.4 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot (see 
Note 3).

INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless Ferritic and Austenitic Alloy-Steel Boiler, 
Superheater, and Heat-Exchanger Tubes 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A213/A213M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1. 1 This specification 2 covers seamless ferritic and auste­
nitic steel boiler, superheater, and heat-exchanger tubes, des­
ignated Grades TS, TP304, etc. These steels are listed in Tables 
1 and 2. 
1.2 Grades containing the letter, H, in their designation, 
have requirements different from those of similar grades not 
containing the letter, H. These different requirements provide 
higher creep-rupture strength than normally achievable in 
similar grades without these different requirements. 
1.3 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter to 5 in. 
[127 mm] in outside diameter and 0.015 to 0.500 in. [0.4 to 
12.7 mm], inclusive, in minimum wall thickness or, if specified 
in the order, average wall thickness. Tubing having other 
diameters may be furnished, provided such tubes comply with 
all other requirements of this specification. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
l.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

ments selected. 
5. General Requirements 
5 .1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification Al016/A1016M, including 
any supplementary requirements that are indicated in the 
purchase order. Failure to comply with the general require­
ments of Specification Al016/A1016M constitutes nonconfor­
mance with this specification. In case of conflict between the 
requirements of this specification and Specification A1016/ 
Al016M, this specification shall prevail. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 Manufacture and Condition-Tubes shall be made by 
the seamless process and shall be either hot finished or cold 
finished, as specified. Grade TP34 7HFG shall be cold finished. 
6.2 Heat Treatment: 
286 
6.2.l Ferritic Alloy and Ferritic Stainless Steels-The fer­
ritic alloy and ferritic stainless steels shall be reheated for heat 
treatment in accordance with the requirements of Table 3. Heat 
treatment shall be carried out separately and in addition to 
heating for hot forming. 
6.2.2 Austenitic Stainless Steels-AU austenitic tubes shall 
be furnished in the heat-treated condition, and shall be heat 
treated in accordance with the requirements of Table 3. 
Alternatively, immediately after hot forming, while the tem­
perature of the tubes is not less than the minimum solution or 
stabilization treatment temperature specified in Table 3, tubes 
may be individually quenched in water or rapidly cooled by 
other means (direct quenched). 
6.3 If any controlled structural characteristics are required, 
these shall be so specified in the order as to be a guide as to the 
most suitable heat treatment. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 Composition Requirements: 
7 .1.1 The alloy steels shall conform to the chemical require­
ments given in Table 1. 
7.1.2 The stainless steels shall conform to the chemical 
requirements given in Table 2. 
7.2 Product Analysis:

=== Page 339 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-213/SA-213M (ASTM A213/A213M) 
7 .2.1 An analysis of either one billet or one tube shall be 
made from each heat. The chemical composition thus deter­
mined shall conform to the requirements specified. 
7.2.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional billets or tubes shall be made. Both retests, for 
the elements in question, shall meet the requirements of the 
specification; otherwise all remaining material in the heat shall 
be rejected or, at the option of the producer, each billet or tube 
may be individually tested for acceptance. Billets or tubes that 
do not meet the requirements of the specification shall be 
rejected. 
8. Grain Size 
8.1 Grain size shall be as given in Table 3, as determined in 
accordance with Test Methods E112. 
8.2 Grain size determinations, to demonstrate compliance 
with 8.1, shall be made on one end of one finished tube from 
each lot. See 15.1. 
9. Mechanical Properties 
9.1 Tensile Requirements: 
9.1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties given in Table 4. 
9.1.2 Table 5 gives the computed minimum elongation 
values for each V32-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. 
Where the wall thickness lies between two values shown in 
Table 5, the minimum elongation value shall be determined by 
the following equations. For Grades T23, T24, T91, T92, T115, 
T122, Tl28, T911, T921, and S44400: E = 32t + 10.00 [E = 
1.25t + 10.00]. For Grade T36: E = 32t + 5.0 [E = 1.25t + 5.0]. 
For grade T93: E = 32t + 9.00 [E = l.25t + 9.00]. For all other 
ferritic alloy grades: E = 48t + 15.00 [E = l.87t + 15.00]. 
where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. [50 mm], %, and 
t = actual thickness of specimen, in. [mm]. 
9 .1.3 One tension test shall be made on a specimen from one 
tube for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall be 
made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes. See 15.2. 
9.2 Hardness Requirements: 
9 .2.1 The material shall conform to the hardness require­
ments given in Table 4. See 15.2. 
9.2.2 Brinell, Vickers, or Rockwell hardness tests shall be 
made on specimens from two tubes from each lot. See 15.2. 
9 .3 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used 
for the flaring test, from each lot. See 15.1. 
9.4 Flaring Test-One flaring test shall be made on speci­
mens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used for 
the flattening test, from each lot. See 15.1. 
9.5 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than Vs in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 
thinner than 0.015 in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
10. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
10.1 Each tube shall be subjected to the nondestructive 
electric test or the hydrostatic test. The type of test to be used 
shall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order. 
11. Forming Operations 
11.1 Tubes, when inserted in a boiler or tube sheet, shall 
stand expanding and beading without showing cracks or flaws. 
Superheater tubes when properly manipulated shall stand all 
forging, welding, and bending operations necessary for appli­
cation without developing defects. See Note 1. 
NOTE I-Certain of the ferritic steels covered by this specification will 
harden if cooled rapidly from above their critical temperature. Some will 
air harden, that is, become hardened to an undesirable degree when cooled 
in air from high temperatures, particularly chromium-containing steels 
with chromium of 4 % and higher. Therefore, operations that involve 
heating such steels above their critical temperatures, such as welding, 
flanging, and hot bending, should be followed by suitable heat treatment. 
12. Repair by Welding 
12.1 Repair welding shall be performed in conformance . 
with Specification A1016/A1016M. 
12.2 All repair welds in T91 shall be made with one of the 
following welding processes and consumables: SMAW, A5.5/ 
A5.5M E90XX-B9; SAW, A5.23/A5.23M EB9 + neutral flux; 
GTAW, A5.28/A5.28M ER90S-B9; and FCAW A5.29/A5.29M 
E91Tl-B9. In addition, the sum of the Ni+Mn content of all 
welding consumables used to weld repair T91 Types 1 and 2 
shall not exceed 1.0 %. 
12.3 All repair welds in T92, T93, T911, and T122, shall be 
made using welding consumables meeting the chemical re­
quirements for the grade in Table 1. 
13. Permissible Variations from the Specified Wall 
Thickness 
13.1 Permissible variations from the specified minimum 
wall thickness shall be in accordance with Specification 
A1016/A1016M. 
13.2 Permissible variations from the specified average wall 
thickness shall be ± 10 % of the specified average wall 
thickness for cold formed tubes and, unless otherwise specified 
by the purchaser, shall be in accordance with Table 6 for hot 
formed tubes. 
287 
14. Surface Condition 
14.1 Ferritic alloy cold-finished steel tubes shall be free of 
scale and suitable for inspection. A slight amount of oxidation 
is not considered scale. 
14.2 Ferritic alloy hot-finished steel tubes shall be free of 
loose scale and suitable. for inspection. • 
14.3 Stainless steel tubes shall be pickled free of scale. 
When bright annealing is used, pickling is not necessary. 
14.4 Any special finish requirement shall be subject to 
agreement between the supplier and the purchaser. 
15. Sampling 
15.1 For flattening, flaring, and grain size·requirements, the 
term lot applies to all tubes, prior to cutting, of the same size· 
(see 4.1.7) that are produced from the same heat of steel.When

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the 
inquiry, contract, or order. 
Sl. Stress-Relieved Annealed Tubes 
S 1.1 For use in certain corrosives, particularly chlorides 
where stress corrosion may occur, tubes in Grades TP304L, 
TP316L, TP321, TP347, and TP348 may be specified in the 
stress-relieved annealed condition. 
Sl.2 When stress-relieved tubes are specified, tubes shall be 
given a heat treatment at 1500 to 1650 °F [815 to 900 °C] after 
roll straightening. Cooling from this temperature range may be 
either in air or by slow cooling. No mechanical straightening is 
permitted after the stress-relief treatment. 
Sl.3 Straightness of the tubes shall be a matter of negotia­
tion between the purchaser and supplier. 
S2. Stabilizing Heat Treatment 
S2.1 Subsequent to the solution anneal required in Section 
6, Grades TP309HCb, TP310HCb, TP310HCbN, TP321, 
TP321H, TP347, TP347H, TP348, and TP348H shall be given 
a stabilization heat treatment at a temperature lower than that 
used for the initial solution annealing heat treatment. The 
temperature of stabilization heat treatment shall be at a 
temperature as agreed upon between the purchaser and vendor. 
S3. Unstraightened Tubes 
S3 .1 When the purchaser specifies tubes unstraightened 
after final heat treatment (such as coils), the minimum yield 
strength of Table 4 shall be reduced by 5 ksi [35 MPa]. 
S3.2 On the certification, and wherever the grade designa­
tion for unstraightened tubing appears, it shall be identified 
with the suffix letter "U" (for example, 304-U, 321-U, etc.). 
S4. lntergranular Corrosion Test 
S4.1 When specified, material shall pass intergranular cor­
rosion tests conducted by the manufacturer in accordance with 
Practices A262, Practice E. 
Norn S4.1-Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condition for 
low carbon or stabilized grades, and on the as-shipped condition for other 
grades. 
S4.2 A stabilization heat treatment in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement S2 may be necessary and is 
permitted in order to meet this requirement for the grades 
containing titanium or columbium, particularly in their H 
versions. 
SS. Minimum Cooling Rate for Grade T91 Type 2 
S5.l For Grade T91 Type 2 material, the heat treatment 
shall ensure that following austenitizing the rate of cooling 
from 1650 °F to 900 °F [900 °C to 480 °C] is no slower than 
9 °F/min [5 °C/ min].

Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Carbon Steel Heat-Exchanger 
and Condenser Tubes 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
electric-resistance-welded, carbon steel tubes to be used for 
heat exchangers, condensers, and similar heat-transfer appara­
tus. 
1.2 The tubing sizes usually furnished to this specification 
are to 3 in. [76.2 mm] in outside diameter, inclusive. Tubing 
having other dimensions may be furnished, provided such 
tubes comply with all other requirements of this specification. 
1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.4 The purchaser shall specify in the order the outside 
diameter and minimum wall thickness. The inside diameter 
shall not be specified. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical

This standard is issued under the fixed designation A217/A217M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon ( e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.

1. Scope* 
L 1 This specification 2 covers martensitic stainless steel and 
alloy steel castings for valves, flanges, fittings, and other 
pressure-containing parts (Note 1) intended primarily for 
high-temperature and corrosive service (Note 2). 
1.2 One grade of martensitic stainless steel and nine grades 
of ferritic alloy steel are covered. Selection will depend on 
design and service conditions, mechanical properties, and the 
high-temperature and corrosion-resistant characteristics (Note 
3). 
NoTB I-Carbon steel castings for pressure-containing parts are cov­
ered by Specification A216/A216M. Low alloy quench-and-tempered 
grades equivalent to Specification A217/A217M grades may be found in 
both Specifications A352/A352M and A487/A487M. 
NoTB 2-The grades covered by this specification represent materials 
that are generally suitable for assembly with other castings or wrought 
steel parts by fusion welding. It is not intended to imply that these grades 
possess equal degrees of weldability; therefore, it is the responsibility of 
the purchaser to establish for himself a suitable welding technique. Since 
these grades possess varying degrees of suitability for high-temperature 
and corrosion-resistant service, it is also the responsibility of the purchaser 
to determine which grade shall be furnished, due consideration being 
given to the requirements of the applicable construction codes. 
NoTB 3-The committee formulating this specification has included 
nine grades of materials that are considered to represent basic types of 
ferritic alloy steels suitable for valves, flanges, fittings, and other pressure­
containing parts. Additional alloy steels that may better fulfill certain types 
of service will he considered for inclusion in this specification by the 
committee as the need becomes apparent. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each

Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Manganese-Vanadium­
Nickel 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers manganese-vanadium-nickel 
alloy steel plates intended primarily for welded layered pres­
sure vessels. 
1.2 Plates under this specification are available in two 
grades having different strength levels as follows: 
Grade 
C 
D 
Tensile Strength, ksi [MPa] 
1 05-135 [725-930] 
3 in. [75 mm] and under 80-105 [550-725] 
Over 3 in. [75 mm] 75-100 [515-690] 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the chemical composition to meet the specified 
mechanical property requirements. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be. regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
312 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is refe1Ted to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.3 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates 
produced from coil means plates that have been cut to 
individual lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or 
is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of 
coils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, 
leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, 
heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for 
shipment, and certification. 
Norn 1-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat 
treatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are reported for 
each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plates from coil 
are described in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail.

Piping Fittings of Wrought Carbon Steel and Alloy Steel for 
Moderate and High Temperature Service 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A234/A234M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers wrought carbon steel and 
alloy steel fittings of seamless and welded construction covered 
by the latest revision of ASME B16.9, B16.11, MSS-SP-79, 
MSS-SP-83, MSS-SP-95, and MSS-SP-97. These fittings are 
for use in pressure piping and in pressure vessel fabrication for 
service at moderate and elevated temperatures. Fittings differ­
ing from these ASME and MSS standards shall be furnished in 
accordance with Supplementary Requirement S58 of Specifi­
cation A960/ A960M. 
1.2 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for 
fittings where a greater degree of examination is desired. When 
desired, one or more of these supplementary requirements may 
be specified in the order. 
1.3 This specification does not cover cast welding fittings or 
fittings machined from castings. Cast steel welding fittings are 
governed by Specifications A216/A216M and A217/A217M. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard.

the temperature range of 1350 °F [730 °C] to 1470 °F [800 °C] 
as a final heat treatment. 
8.3.8 Grade WP115 shall be normalized in the temperature 
range of 1920 °F [1050 °C] to 2010 °F [1100 °C]. 
8.4 WPB and WPC Fittings Made from Bar-Cold-finished 
bars reduced in cross-sectional area more than 10 % by cold 
drawing or cold rolling are not acceptable for use in the 
manufacture of these fittings unless the bars have been either 
stress relieved in the temperature range of 1100 to 1250 °F 
[595 to 675 °C], normalized, normalized and tempered, or 
annealed. Mechanical testing must be performed subsequent to 
the final heat-treating operation. 
8.5 Liquid quenching followed by tempering shall be per­
mitted for all grades when approved by the purchaser. Mini­
mum tempering temperature shall be 1100 °F [595 °C] for 
WPB, WPC, and WPR, 1150 °F [620 °C] for Grades WPl Type 
1 and Type 2, WPll Class 1, WPll Class 2, WP 12 Class 1, 
and WP12 Class 2 and 1250 °F [675 °C] for Grades WPS, 
WP9, WP22 Class 1, 1350 °F [730 °C] for both Grade WP91 
Type 1 and Type 2 and WP911 and 1380 °F [750 °C] for Grade 
WP115. The tempering temperature range for WP24 shall be as 
in 8.3.3. 
8.5.1 Liquid quenching followed by tempering for grades 
WPll Class 3 and WP22 Class 3 shall be permitted at the 
manufacturer's option unless otherwise provided in the pur­
chase order. The minimum tempering temperature for WPll 
Class 3 shall be 1150 °F [620 °C] and for WP22 Class 3 shall 
be 1250 °F [675 °C]. 
9. Chemical Composition 
9 .1 The chemical composition of each cast or heat used 
shall be determined and shall conform to the requirements of 
the chemical composition for the respective materials listed in 
Table 1. The ranges as shown have been expanded to include 
variations of the chemical analysis requirements that are listed 
in the various specifications for the starting materials (pipe, 
tube, plate, bar, and forgings) normally used in the manufac­
turing of fittings to this specification. 
9.2 The steel shall not contain any unspecified elements for 
the ordered grade to the extent that it conforms to the 
requirements of another grade for which that element is a 
specified element having a required minimum content. 
9.3 Weld metal used in the construction of carbon-steel 
fittings shall be mild steel analysis No. Al of Table QW-442, 
Section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, No. 
A2 may be used for Grade WPCW. 
9.4 The molybdenum and chromium content of the depos­
ited weld metal of alloy steel fittings shall be within the same 
percentage range as permitted for the base metal. 
9.5 Weld metal used in the construction of WP24 fittings 
shall be of the composition: 2.25 % Cr, 1 % Mo, 0.25 % V. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 The tensile properties of the fitting material shall 
conform to the requirements listed in Table 2. 
10.1.1 Longitudinal or transverse specimens cut from either 
a fitting or from the starting plate or pipe they were manufac-
tured from shall be acceptable for the tension test. For fittings 
made from forgings, the test specimen shall meet the require­
ments of Specification Al05/A105M for the tension test. 
10.1.2 While Table 2 specifies elongation requirements for 
both longitudinal and transverse specimens, it is not the intent 
that both requirements apply simultaneously. Instead, it is 
intended that only the elongation requirement that is appropri­
ate for the specimen used be applicable. 
10.2 One tension test shall be made on each heat of material 
and in the same condition of heat treatment as the finished 
fittings it represents. Where plate or pipe is used for the test 
specimen, the specimen thickness tested shall represent all 
fittings made from the same heat of material in the same heat 
treat condition in any thickness up to and including the tested 
thickness. Same heat treatment condition means that the same 
type of heat treatment (for example, stress relieve, normalize) 
and the same heat treating cycles (temperatures, time at 
temperature (minimum), temperature uniformity of ±25 °F 
[±14 °C], cooling method, etc.) are used (see 9.3 of Specifica­
tion A960/A960M for furnace uniformity requirement). 
10.3 When cold-formed fittings are furnished, samples of 
the raw material shall be normalized or stress relieved as 
required in 8.2.4. Tension tests conducted on these heat-treated 
samples shall be considered to be the tensile properties of the 
cold-formed fittings. 
10.4 Records of raw material test report of the tension tests 
shall be certification that the material of the fitting meets the 
tensile requirements of this specification provided the heat 
treatments of the finished fitting are the same as the raw 
material test report. If the raw material was not tested, or the 
fitting is not in the same condition of heat treatment, the fitting 
manufacturer shall perform the required test on material 
representative of the finished fitting from each heat of starting 
material. For fittings that are not heat treated in accordance 
with 8.2.1 or 8.2.3, the raw material test report data can be used 
to represent the fitting properties provided the heat treatments 
are the same. 
10.5 When testing of the finished fittings is requested by the 
purchaser, see Supplementary Requirement S51 in Specifica­
tion A960/ A960M. 
333 
11. Hardness 
11.1 Except when only one fitting is produced, and except 
for Grade WP91 Type 1 and Type 2, a minimum of two pieces 
per batch or continuous run shall be hardness tested to ensure 
the fittings are within the following limits for each grade in 
Table 2. The purchaser may verify that the requirement has 
been met by testing at any location on the fitting provided such 
testing does not render the fitting useless. 
11.1.1 Fittings of Grades WPS, WP9, and WPR-217 HBW 
maximum. 
11.1.2 Fittings of Grade WP24 and WP911-248 HBW 
maximum. 
11.1.3 Fittings of Grade WP92-269 HBW maximum. 
11.1.4 Fittings of all other grades-197 HBW maximum.

Standard Specification for 
Chromium and Chromium-Nickel Stainless Steel Plate, 
Sheet, and Strip for Pressure Vessels and for General 
Applications 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers chromium, chromium-nickel, 
and chromium-manganese-nickel stainless steel plate, sheet, 
and strip for pressure vessels and for general applications 
including architectural, building, construction, and aesthetic 
applications. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.3 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound and 
SI units. However, unless the order specifies the applicable 
"M" specification designation (SI units), the material shall be 
furnished in inch-pound units. 
I .4 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

8 Yield strength shall be determined by the offset method at 0.2 % in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. Unless otherwise specified (see Specification A480/A480M, paragraph 4.1.11, Ordering 
Information), an alternative method of determining yield strength may be based on total extension under load of 0.5 %. 
c Either Brinell or denoted Rockwell Hardness scale is permissible. For thin materials, see Specification A480/A480M (17.2.1) and Test Methods A370 (18.1.2) on superficial testing. 
0 Bend tests are not required for chromium steels (ferritic or martensitic) thicker than 1 in. (25 mm] or for any austenitic or duplex (austenitic-ferritic) stainless steels regardless of thickness. 
£Elongation for thickness, less than 0.D15 in. (0.38 mm] shall be 20 % minimum, in 1 in. (25.4 mm]. 
F Common name, not a trademark, widely used, not associated with any one producer. 
G Yield strength requirements shall not apply to material under 0.020 in [0.50 mm] in thickness. 
H Not applicable for thicknesses under 0.010 in. (0.25 mm]. 
1 Type 201 is generally produced with a chemical composition balanced for rich side (Type 201-1) or lean side (Type 201-2) austenite stability depending on the properties required for specific applications. 
J Naming system developed and applied by ASTM. 
KFor S32615, the grain size as determined in accordance with the Test Methods E112, Comparison Method, Plate II, shall be No. 3 or finer. 
L Prior to Specification A240 - 89b, the tensile value for S32950 was 90 ksi. 
M S40900 (Type 409) has been replaced by S40910, S40920, and S40930. Unless otherwise specified in the ordering information, an order specifying S40900 or Type 409 shall be satisfied by any one of S40910, S40920, 
or S40930 at the option of the seller. Material meeting the requirements of S40910, S40920, or S40930, may at the option of the manufacturer be certified as S40900. 
N Material 0.050 in [1.27 mm] and under in thickness shall have a minimum elongation of 20 %. 
0 Hardness is required to be provided for information only, but is not required to meet a particular requirement. 
P The minimum elongation for plates thicker than 0.630 in. (16 mm) shall be 8 %. 
0 Maximum. Type 420 is usually used in the heat-treated condition (quenched and tempered to a specific range of hardness or tensile strength). 
R Hardness conversion tables for superduplex stainless steels do not exist in ASTM E140. The conversion value from HBW to HRC has been added to maintain consistency with other ASTM standards for these 
superduplex stainless steels.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
A supplementary requirement shall apply only when specified in the purchase order. 
Sl. Charpy Impact Testing of Plate 
S 1.1 Charpy impact tests shall be conducted in accordance 
with Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
Sl.2 Number of Tests-One impact test (three specimens) 
shall be made from one plate per heat treatment lot in the final 
heat treated condition. 
Sl.3 Orientation of Test Specimens-Unless specified as 
transverse specimens (long axis of the specimen transverse to 
the final rolling direction, root of the notch perpendicular to the 
rolling face) on the purchase order, the orientation o~ the 
specimens shall be longitudinal (long axis of the spec11nen 
parallel to the final rolling direction, root of the_ notch ~erpen­
dicular to the rolling face). The manufacturer is permitted to 
test transverse specimens provided that such tests meet the 
acceptance criteria applicable to longitudinal specimen~. Un­
less otherwise specified on the purchase order, the specimens 
shall be taken so as to include the mid-thickness of the product. 
S 1 .4 Test Temperature-The purchaser shall specify the 
test temperature. The manufacturer is permitted to test speci­
mens at a temperature lower than that specified by the 
purchaser, provided that such tests shall meet the acceptance 
criteria applicable to specimens tested at the specified tempera­
ture (see the note below). 
Norn S 1.1-Test Methods A923, Method B, applicable to some duplex 
(austenitic-fen-itic) stainless steels as listed in Test ~ethods A923, uses a 
Charpy impact test for the purpose of detern:immg the absence of 
detrimental intermetallic phases. Method B specifies a test temperature 
and acceptance criterion, expressed as impact energy, for each type of 
steel covered. It may be economical for the Charpy impact tests performed 
on duplex stainless steels covered in both Specification A240 and _Test 
Methods A923 to be performed at the lower of the temperatures specified 
by this supplementary requirement and Test Methods A923 Method B, 
with measurement of both lateral expansion and impact energy. 
352 
S 1.5 Acceptance Limit-Unless otherwise specified on the 
purchase order, each of the three specimens tested shall sh~w 
a lateral expansion opposite the notch of not less than 0.015 m. 
[0.38 mm]. 
Sl.6 Records-The recorded results shall include the 
specimen orientation, specimen size, test temperature, ~b­
sorbed energy values (if required), and lateral expans10n 
opposite the notch. 
S2. Materials for High-Temperature Service 
S2.l Unless an H grade has been ordered, this supplemen­
tary requirement shall be specified for ASME Code applica­
tions for service above 1000°F [540°C]. 
S2.2 The user is permitted to use an austenitic stainless 
steel as the corresponding H grade when the material meets all 
requirements of the H grade including chemistry, annealing 
temperature, and grain size (see Section 6). . . 
S2.3 The user is permitted to use an L grade austemtic 
stainless steel for service above 1000°F [540°C], subject to the 
applicable allowable stress table of the ASME Code, when the 
material meets all requirements of this specification and the 
grain size is ASTM No. 7 or coarser as determined in 
accordance with Test Methods E112. The grain size shall be 
reported on a Certified Test Report. 
S3. One Percent Offset Yield Strength 
S3 .1 If reporting of 1 % offset yield strength is specified on 
the purchase order; the material shall meet the strength 
requirements shown in Table S3.1. . 
S3.2 The mechanical properties, including 1 % offset yield 
strength and all other required properties shall be reported on 
a Material Test Report.

SA-249 /SA-249M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Welded Austenitic Steel Boiler, Superheater, Heat­
Exchanger, and Condenser Tubes 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers nominal-wall-thickness 
welded tubes and heavily cold worked welded tubes made from 
the austenitic steels listed in Table 1, with various grades 
intended for such use as boiler, superheater, heat exchanger, or 
condenser tubes. 
1.2 Grades TP304H, TP309H, TP309HCb, TP310H, 
TP310HCb, TP316H, TP321H, TP347H, and TP348H are 
modifications of Grades TP304, TP309S, TP309Cb, TP310S, 
TP310Cb, TP316, TP321, TP347, and TP348, and are intended 
for high-temperature service such as for superheaters and 
reheaters. 
1.3 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter to 12 in. 
[304.8 mm] in outside diameter and 0.015 to 0.320 in. [0.4 to 
8.1 mm], inclusive, in wall thickness. Tubing having other 
dimensions may be furnished, provided such tubes comply 
with all other requirements of this specification. 
1.4 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.5 Optional supplementary requirements are provided and, 
when one or more of these are desired, each shall be so stated 
in the order. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.7 The following safety hazards caveat pertains only to the 
test method described in the Supplementary Requirements of 
this specification. This standard does not purport to address all 
of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. A 
specific warning statement is given in Supplementary Require­
ment S7, Note S7.1. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material welded tubes (WLD) or heavily cold 
worked tubes (HCW), 
3.1.3 Grade (Table 1), 
3.1.4 Size (outside diameter and nominal wall thickness), 
3.1.5 Length (specific or random), 
3.1.6 Optional requirements (13.6), 
3.1.7 Test report required (see Certification Section of 
Specification A1016/A1016M), 
3.1.8 Specification designation, and 
3.1.9 Special requirements and any supplementary require­
ments selected. 
3.1.9.1 If Supplementary Requirement S7 is specified, in­
clude weld decay ratio per S 11.1.1. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A1016/Al016M, unless otherwise provided 
herein. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 The welded (WLD) tubes shall be made from flat-rolled 
steel by an automatic welding process with no addition of filler 
metal. 
5.1.l Subsequent to welding and prior to final heat 
treatment, the tubes shall be cold worked either in both weld 
and base metal or in weld metal only. The method of cold 
working may be specified by the purchaser. When cold drawn, 
the purchaser may specify the minimum amount of reduction in 
cross-sectional area or wall thickness, or both. 
5.1.2 Heavily cold worked (HCW) tubes shall be made by 
applying cold working of not less than 35 % reduction in both 
wall and weld to a welded tube prior to the final anneal. No 
filler metal shall be used in the making of the weld. Prior to 
cold working, the weld shall be 100 % radiographically in­
spected in accordance with the requirements of ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1, latest 
revision, Paragraph UW 51. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 All material shall be furnished in the heat-treated 
condition in accordance with the requirements of Table 2. 
6.2 A solution annealing temperature above 1950 °F [1065 
0 C] may impair the resistance to intergranular corrosion after 
subsequent exposure to sensitizing conditions in TP309HCb, 
TP310HCb, TP321, TP321H, TP347, TP347H, TP348, and 
TP348H. When specified by the purchaser, a lower temperature 
stabilization or re-solution anneal shall be used subsequent to 
the initial high temperature solution anneal (see Supplementary 
Requirement S4). 
6.3 N08020 shall be supplied in the stabilization treatment 
condition. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The heat analysis shall conform to the requirements as 
to chemical composition given in Table 1. 
8. Product Analysis 
8.1 An analysis of either one length of flat-rolled stock or 
one tube shall be made for each heat. The chemical composi­
tion thus determined shall conform to the requirements given in 
Section 7. 
8.2 A product analysis tolerance of Table Al.I in Specifi­
cation A480/ A480M shall apply. The product analysis toler­
ance is not applicable to the carbon content for material with a 
specified maximum carbon of 0.04 % or less. 
8.3 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be 
made. Both retests for the elements in question shall meet the 
requirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot (See 13.9.1) shall be rejected or, at 
the option of the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or 
tube may be individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of 
flat-rolled stock or tubes that do not meet the requirements of 
the specification shall be rejected. 
360 
9. Tensile Requirements 
9 .1 The material shall conform to the tensile properties 
prescribed in Table 3. 
10. Hardness Requirements 
10.1 The tubes shall have a Rockwell hardness number not 
exceeding the values specified in Table 3. 
10.2 For tubing less than 0.354 in. [9.00 mm] in inside 
diameter and for tubing less than 0.065 in. [1.65 mm] in wall 
thickness, it is permissible to use the Vickers hardness test in 
lieu of the Rockwell test. Tubes shall have a Vickers hardness 
number not exceeding the values specified in Table 3. 
11. Reverse-Bend Test Requirement 
11.1 A section 4 in. [100 mm] minimum in length shall be 
split longitudinally 90° on each side of the weld. The sample 
shall then be opened and bent around a mandrel with a 
maximum thickness of four times the wall thickness, with the 
mandrel parallel to the weld and against the original outside 
surface of the tube. The weld shall be at the point of maximum 
bend. There shall be no evidence of cracks, or of overlaps 
resulting from the reduction in thickness of the weld areas by 
cold working. When the geometry or size of the tubing make it

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
. ~e following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the 
mqmry, contract, or order. 
Sl. Stress-Relieved Annealed Tubes 
S 1.1 For use in certain corrosives, particularly chlorides 
where stres~ corrosion may occur, tubes in Grades TP304L, 
TP316L, TP321, TP347, and TP348 may be specified in the 
stress-relieved annealed condition. Details of these supplemen­
tal requirements shall be agreed upon by the manufacturer and 
the purchaser. 
S 1.2 When stress-relieved tubes are specified, tubes shall be 
given a heat treatment at 1550 to 1650 °F [845 to 900 °C] after 
roll straightening. Cooling from this temperature range may be 
either in air or by slow cooling. No mechanical straightening is 
permitted after the stress-relief treatment. 
S 1.3 Straightness of the tubes shall be a matter of negotiation 
between the purchaser and manufacturer. 
S2. Minimum Wall Tubes 
S2.1 When specified by the purchaser, tubes shall be fur­
nished on a minimum wall basis. Such tubes shall satisfy the 
minimum wall thickness requirements of Specification A1016/ 
Al016M rather than the nominal wall requirements of this 
specification. In ~ddition to the marking required by Section 
18, the tubing shall be marked S2. 
S3. Pneumatic Test 
S3.1 The tubing shall be examined by a pneumatic test 
(either air under water or pneumatic leak test) in accordance 
with Specification A1016/Al016M. 
S4. Stabilizing Heat Treatment 
S4.1 Subsequent to the solution anneal required in Section 
6, Grades TP309HCb, TP310HCb, TP321, TP321H, TP347, 
TP347H, TP348, and TP348H shall be given a stabilization 
heat treatment at a temperature lower than that used for the 
initial solution annealing heat treatment. The temperature of 
stabilization heat treatment shall be at a temperature as agreed 
upon between the purchaser and vendor. 
SS. DELETED 
S6. Intergranular Corrosion Test 
S6.l When specified, material shall pass intergranular cor­
rosion tests conducted by the manufacturer in accordance with 
Practices A262, Practice E. 
NoTE S6.1-Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condition for 
low carbon or stabilized grades, and on the as-shipped condition for other 
grades. 
S6.2 A stabilization heat treatment in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement S4 may be necessary and is 
permitted in order to meet this requirement for the grades 
containing titanium or columbium, particularly in their H 
versions. 
364 
87. Weld Decay Test 
S7.1 This test is not applicable to alloys with a nickel 
content 2:: 19.0 % or a molybdenum content 2:: 4.00 %, or both. 
Norn S7.1-Toe weld decay test is sensitive for the presence of delta 
ferrite in the weld material. Increasing amounts of delta ferrite will result 
in a higher ratio as defined in S7 .10. Alloys with the high nickel or 
molybdenum content of S7 .1 may not form delta fenite and therefore may 
not be sensitive to this test. 
S7.2 When specified by the purchase order, one sample 
from each lot of tubing (See 13.9.2) shall be subjected to 
testing in a boiling mixture of 50 % reagent grade hydrochloric 
acid and 50 % water. 
S7 .3 Approximately 2-in. long samples shall be prepared 
from a production length of tubing. Shorter, 1-in. samples may 
be used for small diameter (½-in. and below) tubing. Split the 
sample longitudinally to allow for easy micrometer measure­
ments. The sample may be one piece which contains the weld 
and at least 90° of base-metal to one side of the weld. 
Alternately, the sample may be two separate pieces with one 
containing the weld and a similar size section from the balance 
of the tube opposite the weld consisting of 100 % base metal. 
Remove all burrs and sharp edges by lightly grinding. Remove 
dust and grease by cleaning with soap and water or other 
suitable solvents. Then, place sample(s) in the flask. It is not 
recommended to test more than four samples together, or to 
mix alloy types. 
S7.4 Prepare the hydrochloric acid solution by slowly add­
ing reagent grade (approximately 37 %) hydrochloric acid to 
an equal volume of distilled water. (Warning-Protect eyes 
and use rubber gloves when handling acid. Mixing shall be 
done under a hood and testing shall be run under a hood.) 
S7.5 The test container shall be a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask 
equipped with ground-glass joints and an Ahlin condenser. The 
volume of the solution shall be approximately 700 mL. 
S7 .6 Measure the thickness of the tube at five locations 
along the weld area and at five locations along the base-metal 
section. In both cases, take measurements at approximately 
equal longitudinal intervals along the section lengths. Make 
these measurements with a sharp pointed micrometer accurate 
to at least 0.001 in. The micrometer must be suitable for 
measuring the small features in the surface after testing. 
Typical pin micrometers have tapered anvils with a tip radius 
of less than 0.015 in. 
S7.7 Immerse the samples into the solution. Add boiling 
chips and bring to a boil. Allow the chips to remain boiling 
throughout the test. The time of testing shall be that which is 
required to remove 40 to 60 % of the original base-metal

=== Page 417 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-249 /SA-249M 
thickness (usually 2 h or less). If more than 60 % of the 
base-metal thickness remains, the sample may be removed 
after 24 h. 
S7 .8 At the end of the test period, remove the samples from 
the solution, rinse with distilled water, and dry. 
S7.9 After exposure to the test solution, repeat the tube­
thickness measurement as in S7.6. If the thinning is not 
uniform across the width of the weld, then two sets of 
weld-metal measurement are required. One set of measure­
ments is to be taken along the centerline of the weld. The 
second set of measurements is to be taken in the thinnest area 
of the weld. 
S7 .10 Calculate the corrosion ratio, R, for both sections of 
the weld as follows in Eq 1: 
where: 
R= WO -w 
B 0 -B 
W 0 = average weld-metal thickness before the test, 
W = average weld-metal thickness after the test, 
B 0 = average base-metal thickness before the test, and 
B = average base-metal thickness after the test. 
S7.11 Acceptance Criteria: 
(1) 
S7 .11.1 The ratio of the thinnest section of the weld and 
adjacent heat affected zone versus the base metal shall be 
determined. The following ratios or alternatives are commonly 
specified: 
S7.ll.l.1 A corrosion ratio of 1.25 or less. If not specified 
by the purchase order, this is the default criteria. 
S7.ll.l.2 A corrosion ratio of 1.00 or less. 
S7.11.1.3 Alternative ratios may be agreed between the 
purchaser and supplier. 
S8. Special Applications 
S8.1 For special applications, such as hydraulic expansion 
of tubes into tube sheets, dimensions of the weld shape and 
thickness shall be per agreement between the purchaser and 
supplier. Tubes ordered to this requirement shall bear the 
additional marking of NB. 
S9. Additional Testing of Welded Tubing for ASME Re­
quirements 
S9.l. When this supplement is specified in the purchase 
order, in certain ASME applications it is permissible to use 
100 % joint efficiency for longitudinal weld, provided the 
following additional requirements are met: 
S9.l.1 Each tube shall be subjected to an ultrasonic inspec­
tion employing Practices E273 or E213 with the rejection 
criteria referenced in Specification A1016/Al016M. 
S9.l.2 If Practice E273 is employed, a 100 % volumetric 
inspection of the entire length of each tube shall also be 
performed using one of the nondestructive electric tests per­
mitted by Specification A1016/A1016M. 
S9.l.3 The test methods described in the supplement may 
not be capable of inspecting the end portions of tubes. This 
condition is referred to as end effect. This portion, as deter­
mined by the manufacturer, shall be removed and discarded. 
S9.l.4 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A1016/Al016M, "S9" shall be added after the grade designa­
tion. 
ND'rE S9.1-When specified, the special testing in this supplement is 
intended for special ASME applications. It is not mandatory for all ASME 
applications.

3.1.1 This material is considered as single-clad or double­
clad stainless chromium-steel plate, depending on whether one 
or both sides are covered. 
3.1.2 alloy cladding-the stainless chromium steel compo­
nent of the composite plate. 
3.1.3 base metal (backing steel)-component to which the 
alloy cladding is applied, usually the greater percentage of the 
composite plate. 
3.1.4 integrally and continuously bonded-a condition in 
which the alloy cladding and base metal are brought together to 
form a metallurgical bond at essentially the entire interface of 
the two metals by means other than those processes that do not 
produce a homogeneous composite plate. 
4. Ordering Information 
374 
4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces). 
4.1.2 Cladding alloy specification (UNS or ASTM Specifi­
cation A240/ A240M) and whether cladding is for corrosion 
allowance only. 
4.1.3 Base metal specification. 
4.1.4 Bond integrity Class (1, 3, or S; see Section 13). 
4.1.S Dimensions including the minimum or nominal thick-
nesses of the cladding alloy and the backing steel, or of the 
total composite and if more or less restrictive thickness 
tolerances apply. 
4.1.6 Product analysis, ifrequired (see Section 10). Specify 
whether applicable to the cladding alloy, backing steel, or both.

4.1. 7 Mechanical properties including shear test if required 
(see Sections 7, 8, and 9). 
4.1.8 Finish (see Section 12). 
4.1.9 Restrictions, if required, on repair by welding (see 
Section 14). 
4.1.10 Additions to the specification or special requirements 
such as any applicable construction code rules. 
4.1.11 Notification when the cladding alloy is to be used for 
inclusion in the design strength calculations for an applicable 
construction code. 
Norn I-Construction codes may dictate certain fabrication require­
ments when the cladding is used in the design calculations that may be 
different than if the cladding is used for corrosion resistance only. This 
may be particularly important when the alloy cladding involves the use of 
welded components in the explosion bonded clad manufacturing process. 
It is incumbent on the purchaser to make the clad manufacturer aware of 
any such restrictions or applications at time of order. 
4.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this specification 
and the backing steel specification, certain supplementary 
requirements are available when additional control, testing, or 
examination is required to meet end use requirements. The 
purchaser is referred to the listed supplementary requirements 
in this specification and to the detailed requirements in 
Specification A20/A20M. 
4.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Process: 
5.1.1 The steel shall be made by the open-heaiih, electric­
fumace, or basic-oxygen processes, or by secondary processes 
whereby steel made from these primary processes is remelted 
using, but not limited to electroslag remelting or vacuum-arc 
remelting processes. 
5.1.2 The alloy-cladding metal may be metallurgically 
bonded to the base metal by any method that will produce a 
clad steel that will conform to the requirements of this 
specification. 
5.1.3 For explosively bonded products, the alloy cladding 
metal may be comprised of two or more separate alloy plates 
or sheets completely welded together to fonn a single fabri­
cated component. 
5.2 Heat Treatment-Unless otherwise specified or agreed 
upon between the purchaser and the manufacturer, all plates 
shall be furnished in the normalized, tempered, normalized and 
tempered, or quenched and tempered condition as permitted by 
the backing steel specification. Stress relieving of the compos­
ite plate by heating subcritically is permitted, provided the 
temperature is 75°F (40°C) or more below the minimum 
tempering temperature (when tempered). 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The composite plate shall conform to any desired 
combination of alloy-cladding metal and base metal as de­
scribed in 6.2 and 6.3 and as agreed upon between the 
purchaser and the manufacturer. 
6.2 Alloy Cladding Metal-The alloy-cladding metal speci­
fied shall conform to the requirements as to chemical compo­
sition prescribed for the respective chromium steel in Specifi­
cation A240/A240M. 
6.3 Base Metal-The base metal shall be carbon steel or 
low-alloy steel conforming to the ASTM specifications for 
steels for pressure vessels or other as agreed by the purchaser 
and the manufacturer. The base metal shall conform to the 
chemical requirements of the specification to which it is 
ordered. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Tensile Requirements: 
7 .1.1 The tensile properties shall be determined by a tension 
test of the composite plate for clad plates that meet all of the 
following conditions. 
(I) The nominal composite gage is less than or equal to 
1 ½ in. (38 mm). 
(2) The specified minimum tensile strength of the base 
steel is less than or equal to 70 000 psi ( 485 MPa). 
( 3) The specified minimum yield strength of the base steel 
is less than or equal to 40 000 psi (275 MPa). 
The tensile properties thus determined shall be not less than 
the minimum and not more than 5000 psi (35 MPa) over the 
maximum prescribed in the specification for the base steel 
used. All other tensile test requirements of the specification for 
the base steel shall be met. 
7 .1.2 The tensile properties shall be determined by a tension 
test of the base steel only for clad plates that meet one of the 
following conditions. The properties thus determined shall 
meet all of the tensile test requirements for the base steel. 
(I) The composite gage is greater than 1 ½ in. (38 nnn). 
(2) The specified minimum tensile strength of the base 
steel is greater than 70 000 psi (485 MPa). 
(3) The specified minimum yield strength of the base steel 
is greater than 40 000 psi (275 MPa). 
7 .1.3 If the cladding is for corrosion allowance only, the 
cladding need not be included in the tensile test. The tensile 
properties thus determined shall meet the base steel require­
ments. 
7 .2 Tests for strength of the bond, when required, must be 
specified by the purchaser and shall consist of one of the 
following. 
7.2.1 Shear Strength-When required by the purchaser, the 
minimum shear strength of the alloy cladding and base metals 
shall be 20 000 psi (140 MPa). The shear test, when specified, 
shall be made in the manner indicated in Fig. 1. The minimum 
cladding thickness for.shear testing shall be 0.075 in. (1.9 mm) 
exclusive as ordered. Testing for shear strength for clad plates 
with minimum cladding thickness of 0.075 in. (1.9 mm) or less 
shall be permitted upon agreement between the purchaser and 
the manufacturer. 
375 
7.2.2 Bond Strength-As an alternative to the shear strength 
test provided in 7.2.1, or when agreed upon by the purchaser 
and the manufacturer, or both, three bend tests shall be made 
with the alloy cladding in compression to determine the quality 
of the bond. These bend tests shall be made in the manner of 
the tension tests indicated in Fig. 2 and shall be bent through an

edges parallel. In reducing the thickness of the specimen, both 
the alloy cladding and the base steel shall be machined so as to 
maintain the same ratio of clad metal to base steel as is 
maintained in the plate, except that the thickness of the clad 
metal need not be reduced below Vs in. (3.1 mm). The sides of 
the bend test specimen used for bond strength determination 
may have the corners rounded to a radius not over V16 in. (1.6 
mm) for plates, 2 in. (50 mm) and under in thickness, and not 
over Vs in. (3.1 mm) for plates over 2 in. (50 mm) in thickness. 
10. Product Analysis 
10.1 Product analysis may be required for the cladding alloy 
on the finished product. Chemical analysis may be accom­
plished by wet chemical or instrumental procedures. If wet 
chemical procedures are used, millings may be taken only 
when the composite plate thickness is sufficient to permit 
obtaining millings without danger of contamination from the 
adjacent layer. If spectrometric procedures are used, the sample 
shall be exposed on the center line of the cladding when there 
is sufficient cladding thickness available so that there is no 
contamination from the adjacent base metal. 
10.2 If product analysis is specified by the purchaser for the 
cladding alloy, it shall be made from drillings or millings taken 
from the final piece or a broken test specimen. For wet 
chemical analysis, in order to avoid contamination by the base 
plate metal, millings of cladding samples shall be taken from 
the test coupon by removal and discard of all the base metal 
plate material, plus 40 % of the cladding thickness from the 
bonded side, not to exceed V16 in. (1.6 mm). The material shall 
be chemically cleaned and sufficient millings shall be taken to 
represent the full cross-section of the remainder. If there is 
insufficient cladding thickness available to spectrographically 
expose on the center line of the cladding without 
contamination, 50 % of the cladding shall be removed and the 
sample exposed on this surface. 
10.3 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with the 
Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology of A751. 
10.4 Results of the product analysis shall conform to the 
requirements of Section 7 of Specification A480/A480M. 
10.5 Results of the product analysis for the backing steel 
when required shall conform to the requirements of Section 7 
of Specification A20/A20M. 
11. Permissible Variations 
11.1 Permissible variations except for thickness shall be in 
accordance with Specification A20/ A20M. 
11.2 Minimum thickness of the alloy cladding metal and of 
the backing steel, or of the total composite plate shall be as 
required by purchase order documents when ordered to mini­
mum thicknesses. 
11.3 Permissible variation in thickness when ordered to 
nominal thicknesses shall be 0.01 in. (0.3 mm) under each for 
backing steel or total composite, and 0.03 in. (0.8 mm) under 
for the alloy cladding . 
11.4 Permissible variations for excess thickness of the total 
composite shall be the greater of 0.125 in. (3 mm) or 10 % of 
the total composite thickness ordered and may occur in either 
backing steel, cladding, or both, provided the minimum for 
each is met. 
11.5 More restrictive or less restrictive permissible varia­
tions may be agreed upon by the purchaser and the manufac­
turer. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The material shall be free of injurious defects, shall 
have a workmanlike appearance, and shall conform to the 
designated finish. 
12.2 Plate alloy surfaces shall be blasted (descaled by 
means such as sand or stainless grit, shot or wire, or 
equivalent), pickled, blast-cleaned and pickled, or 100 % 
conditioned. 
13. Bond Quality 
13.1 The cladding metal shall be integrally and continu­
ously bonded to the base metal. 
13.2 Inspection: 
13.2.1 Clad plates less than 3/s in. (10 mm) total minimum 
composite thickness shall be visually inspected for bond 
integrity prior to shipment. 
13.2.2 Clad plates 3/s in. (10 mm) and thicker total minimum 
composite thickness, and when specified by the purchaser, clad 
plates less than 3/s in. (10 mm) total minimum composite 
thickness, shall be ultrasonically inspected for bond integrity 
prior to shipment in accordance with the Procedures and 
Methods of Specification A578/A578M. 
13.2.3 Areas of non-bond detected visually shall be ex­
plored ultrasonically to determine the extent of the condition in 
accordance with 13.2.2. For purposes of defining non-bond, the 
cladding shall be interpreted to be unbonded when there is 
complete loss of back reflection accompanied by an echo 
indication from the plane of the interface of the clad and 
backing steel. Areas within 1 in. (25 mm) of a cut edge on the 
plate that contain indications exceeding 50 % of the back 
reflection at the bond interface shall be considered to be 
unbonded. 
13.2.4 Extent of ultrasonic examination shall be at the 
discretion of the manufacturer and sufficient enough to provide 
the quality level required by the purchaser. Plates may be 
ordered with 100 % coverage (Supplementary Requirements 
S12). 
13.3 Quality Levels: 
377 
13.3.1 Class I-No single unbonded area exceeding 1 in. 
(25 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not 
to exceed 1 % of the total cladded surface area. 
13.3.2 Class 3-No single unbonded area exceeding 3 in. 
(75 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not 
to exceed 3 % of the total cladded surface area. 
13.3.3 • Class 5-No single unbonded area exceeding 9 in.2 
(58 cm 2 ) with total unbonded area not to exceed 5 % of the 
total cladded surface area.

furnished as Class 5 at the option of the manufacturer. 
14. Welding 
14.1 All welding which is a part of the delivered product, 
including any made in the fabrication of the cladding alloy 
component, shall be performed with a procedure and welders 
or welding operators that are qualified in accordance with 
Section IX of the ASME Code. 
14.2 The material manufacturer may repair defects in clad­
ding by welding provided the following requirements are met: 
14.2.1 When specified in the purchase order, prior approval 
shall be obtained from the purchaser. 
14.2.2 The defective area shall be removed and the area 
prepared for repair shall be examined by a magnetic particle 
method or a liquid penetrant method to ensure all defective 
area has been removed. Method of test and acceptance standard 
shall be as agreed upon between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
14.2.3 The repair weld shall be deposited in accordance 
with a welding procedure and welding materials suitable for 
the cladding material. The surface condition of the repaired 
area shall be restored to a condition similar to the rest of the 
cladding. 
14.2.4 The repaired area shall be examined by a liquid

Stainless Chromium-Nickel Steel-Clad Plate 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers plate of a carbon steel or 
low-alloy steel base to which is integrally and continuously 
bonded on one or both sides a layer of stainless chromium­
nickel steel. The material is generally intended for pressure 
vessel use. 
1.2 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as standard. The values given in parentheses are mathematical 
conversions to SI units that are provided for information only 
and are not considered standard.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 This material is considered as single-clad or double­
clad corrosion-resisting chromium-nickel steel plate, depend­
ing on whether one or both sides are covered. 
3.1.2 alloy cladding-the stainless chromium-nickel steel 
component of the composite plate. 
3.1.3 base metal (backing" steel)-component to which the 
alloy cladding is applied, usually the greater percentage of the 
composite plate and usually consisting of carbon or low-alloy 
steel. 
3.1.4 integrally and continuously bonded-the process by 
which the alloy cladding and base metal are brought together to 
form a metallurgical bond at essentially the entire interface of 
the two metals by means other than those processes that do not 
produce a homogeneous composite plate. 
4. Ordering Information 
380 
4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for mate1ial ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces). 
4.1.2 Cladding alloy specification, (UNS or ASTM Specifi­
cation A240/ A240M and whether cladding is for conosion 
allowance only), 
4.1.3 Base metal specification. 
4.1.4 Bond integrity Class (1, 3, or 5). 
4.1.5 Dimensions including the minimum or nominal thick­
ness of the cladding alloy, and the backing steel, or of the total 
composite plate and if more or less restrictive thickness 
tolerances apply. 
4.1.6 Product analysis, if required (see Section 10). Specify 
whether applicable to the cladding alloy, backing steel or both.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-264 
4.1. 7 Mechanical properties, including shear test if required. 
4.1.8 Finish (see Section 12). 
4.1.9 Restrictions, if required, on repair by welding (see 
Section 14). 
4.1.10 Additions to the specification or special requirements 
such as any applicable construction code rules. 
4.1.11 Corrosion testing if applicable. 
4.1.12 Notification when the cladding alloy is to be used for 
inclusion in the design strength calculations for an applicable 
construction code. 
NoTE I-Construction codes may dictate certain fabrication require­
ments when the cladding is used in the design calculations that may be 
different than if the cladding is used for corrosion resistance only. This 
may be particularly important when the alloy cladding involves the use of 
welded components in the explosion bonded clad manufactming process. 
It is incumbent on the purchaser to make the clad manufacturer aware of 
any such restrictions or applications at time of order. 
4.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this specification 
and the backing steel specification, certain supplementary 
requirements are available when additional control, testing, or 
examination is required to meet end use requirements. The 
purchaser is referred to the listed supplementary requirements 
in this specification and to the detailed requirements in 
Specification A20/ A20M. 
4.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4.4 Special tests. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Process: 
5.1.1 The steel shall be made by the open-hearth, electric­
fumace, or basic-oxygen processes, or by secondary processes 
whereby steel made from these primary processes is remelted 
using, but not limited to electroslag remelting or vacuum-arc 
remelting processes. 
5.1.2 The alloy-cladding metal inay be metallurgically 
bonded to the base metal by any method that will produce a 
clad steel that will conform to the requirements of this 
specification. 
5.1.3 For explosively bonded products, the alloy cladding 
metal may be comprised of two or more separate alloy plates 
or sheets completely welded together to form a single fabri­
cated component. 
5.2 Heat Treatment: 
5.2.1 Unless otherwise specified or agreed upon between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer, all austenitic stainless steel 
clad plates shall be given a heat treatment consisting of heating 
to the proper temperature for the solution of the chromium 
carbides in the cladding followed by individual air cooling. For 
base metals of air-hardening low-alloy steels the above heat 
treatment shall be followed by a tempering treatment. In the 
case of clad plate manufactured without hot rolling, the base 
metal and alloy cladding components may be heat treated 
separately as appropriate prior to bonding. 
5.2.2 Duplex stainless steel clad plates shall be provided in 
a heat treated condition as agreed upon between the purchaser 
and the manufacturer. 
5.2.3 When plates are to be cold formed, or when otherwise 
required by the base metal specification, the purchaser may 
specify that such plates, following solution annealing, be heat 
treated for grain refinement of the base metal by normalizing 
and either air cooled or water quenched as appropriate. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The composite plate may conform to any desired com­
bination of alloy-cladding metal and base metal as described in 
6.2 and 6.3 and as agreed upon between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
6.2 Alloy Cladding Metal-The alloy-cladding metal speci­
fied shall conform to the requirements as to chemical compo­
sition prescribed for the respective chromium-nickel or duplex 
steel in Specification A240/A240M. 
6.3 Base Metal-The base metal shall be carbon steel or 
low-alloy steel conforming to the ASTM specifications for 
steel for pressure vessels, or other, as agreed by the purchaser 
and the manufacturer. The base metal shall conform to the 
chemical requirements of the specification to which it is 
ordered. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Tensile Requirements: 
7 .1.1 The tensile properties shall be determined by a 
tension test of the composite plate for clad plates that meet all 
of the following conditions. 
(1) The composite gage is less than or equal to 1 ½ in. (38 
mm). 
(2) The specified minimum tensile strength of the base 
steel is less than or equal to 70 000 psi ( 485 MPa) 
381 
( 3) The specified minimum yield strength of the base steel 
is less than or equal to 40 000 psi (275 MPa). 
( 4) The tensile properties thus determined shall be not less 
than the minimum and not more than 5000 psi (35 MPa) over 
the maximum prescribed in the specification for the base steel 
used: All other tensile test requirements of the specification for 
the base steel shall be met. 
7.1.2 The tensile properties shall be determined by a 
tension test of the base steel only for clad plates that meet one 
of the following conditions. The properties thus determined 
shall meet all of the tensile test requirements for the base steel. 
( 1) The composite gage is greater than 1 ½ in. (38 mm). 
(2) The specified minimum tensile strength of the base 
steel is greater than 70 000 psi (485 MPa). 
( 3) The specified minimum yield strength of the base steel 
is greater than 40 000 psi (275 MPa). 
7.1.3 If the cladding is for corrosion allowance only, the 
cladding need not be included in the tensile test. The tensile 
properties thus determined shall meet the base steel require­
ments. 
7 .2 Tests for strength of the bond, when required, must be 
specified by the purchaser and shall consist of one of the 
following. 
7.2.1 Shear Strength-When required by the purchaser, the 
minimum shear strength of the alloy cladding and base metals 
shall be 20 000 psi (140 MPa). The shear test, when specified, 
shall be made in the manner indicated in Fig. 1. The minimum

NoTE 1-Such austenitic grain size numbers may be achieved with 
lower contents of austenitic grain refining elements than 8.3.2 requires for 
austenitic grain size testing to be waived. 
8.3.2 Unless testing for fine austenitic grain size is specified 
in the purchase order or the producer elects to test for fine 
austenitic grain size, the austenitic grain size test need not be 
made for any heat that has, by heat analysis, one or more of the 
following: 
8.3.2.1 A total aluminum content of 0.020 % or more. 
8.3.2.2 An acid soluble aluminum content of 0.015 % or 
more. 
8.3.2.3 A content for an austenitic grain refining element 
that exceeds the minimum value agreed to by the purchaser as 
being sufficient for austenitic grain size testing to be waived. 
8.3.2.4 Contents for the combination of two or more auste­
nitic grain refining elements that exceed the applicable mini­
mum values agreed to by the purchaser as being sufficient for 
austenitic grain size testing to be waived. 
8.3.2.5 The analysis for the elements mentioned in 8.3.2.1, 
8.3.2.2, 8.3.2.3, or 8.3.2.4 shall be included in the test report. 
9. Quality 
9.1 General-Plates shall be free of injurious defects and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. 
9.2 Surface Impeifections: 
9.2.1 For plates produced from plate-as-rolled, all injurious 
surface imperfections shall be removed by the manufacturer. 
For plates produced from coil, all injurious surface imperfec­
tions shall be removed by the processor. 
9.2.1.1 Shallow imperfections shall be ground to sound 
metal; the ground area shall be well faired and the thickness of 
the ground plate shall not be reduced below the minimum 
thickness permitted. 
9 .2.1.2 All surface imperfections, the removal of which will 
reduce the plate thickness below the minimum thickness 
permitted, shall be cause for rejection of the plate, except that, 
73 
by agreement with the purchaser, the metal so removed may be 
replaced with weld metal (see 9.4). 
9.3 Edge Impeifections: 
9.3.1 Laminar-type discontinuities 1 in. [25 mm] and less in 
length visible to the unaided eye on an edge of a plate as 
prepared for shipment by the manufacturer or processor are 
acceptable and do not require exploration. 
9.3.2 All larger discontinuities shall be explored to deter­
mine their depth and extent. Discontinuities shall be considered 
continuous when located in the same plane within 5 % of the 
plate thickness and separated by a distance less than the length 
of the smaller of two adjacent discontinuities. 
9.3.3 Indications visible to the unaided eye on the cut edges 
of a plate as prepared for shipment by the manufacturer or 
processor shall not exceed the limits given in Columns 1 and 2 
of Table Al.14 [A2.14]. 
9.3.4 Larger indications shall be removed by the manufac­
turer or processor by grinding, provided that the resultant 
cavity does not exceed the limits given in Columns 3 and 4 of 
Table Al.14 [A2.14]. 
9.3.5 Indications of greater magnitude shall be cause for 
rejection of the plate, except that, by agreement with the 
purchaser, the defects may be removed and replaced with weld 
metal (see 9.4). 
9.3.6 Indications on the edges of a plate cut during the 
fabrication shall be cause for rejection of the plate at the 
discretion of the purchaser if the magnitude exceeds the limits 
given in Columns 5 and 6 of Table Al .14 [ A2. l 4]. The defects 
may be removed and replaced with weld metal (see 9.4). 
9.3.7 Fabricators should be aware that edge cracks may 
initiate upon bending a sheared or burned edge during the 
fabrication process. This is not considered to be a fault of the 
steel, but is rather a function of the induced cold work or heat 
affected zone. 
9.4 Repair by Welding: 
9.4.1 Repair welding shall be permitted only with the 
approval of the purchaser. 
9.4.2 Preparation for repair welding shall include inspection 
to confirm complete removal of the defect. 
9.4.3 Repairs shall be made utilizing welding procedures 
qualified in accordance with Section IX of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and repair welding 
shall be done by welders or welding operators meeting the 
qualification requirements of Section IX. 
9.4.4 The weld metal shall have the A-number analysis 
corresponding to the equivalent ASME P-number of the plate, 
except that A-1 or A-2 analysis weld metal may be employed 
for P-1 plates. Other weld metals may be employed that are 
compatible with the plate being repaired, if so approved by the 
purchaser. Such weld metals shall be qualified in accordance 
with the requirements of Section IX of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
9.4.5 If Charpy impact tests of the plate are required, the 
welding procedure qualification tests shall also include Charpy 
impact tests of the weld, the heat-affected zone, and the plate, 
and the test results shall be reported to the purchaser. 
9 .4.6 If the plate is subjected to normalizing, quenching and 
tempering, hot forming, or post-weld heat treating, the welding

and of 100 tubes for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm], prior to cutting to length. 
8. General Requirements 
8.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A450/A450M unless otherwise provided herein. 
9. Tensile Requirements 
9.1 Grade C and D tubes shall conform to the requirements 
as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. 
Nom 3-Explanatory Note-For purposes of design the following 
tensile properties may be assumed for Grade A tubes: 
Tensile strength, min, ksi [MPa] 47 [325] 
Yield Strength, min, ksl [MPa] 26 [180] 
Elongation In 2 in. or 50 mm, min, % 35 
9.2 Table 3 gives the computed minimum elongation values 
for each 1/32-in. [0.8 mm] decrease in wall thickness. Where the 
wall thickness lies between two values shown above, the 
minimum elongation value shall be determined by the follow­
ing equation: 
E = 48t+ 15.00[E = l.87t+ 15.00] 
where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm,%, and, 
= actual thickness of specimen, in. [mm]. 
10. Crush Test 
10.1 When required by the purchaser, crushing tests shall be 
made on sections of tube 2½ in. [63 mm] in length which shall 
stand crushing longitudinally without cracking, splitting, or 
opening at the weld, as follows: 
Wall Thickness of 
Tubes, In. [mm] 
Height of Crushed Section, in. [mm]

7.1.3 Except as allowed by 7.1.4 for primary heats, heat 
analyses shall conform to the heat analysis requirements of the 
applicable product specification for the applicable grade,· class, 
and type. 
7.1.4 Where vacuum-arc remelting or electroslag remelting 
is used, a remelted heat is defined as all ingots remelted from 
a single primary heat. If the heat analysis of the primary heat 
conforms to the heat analysis requirements of the applicable 
product specification for the applicable grade, class, and type, 
the heat analysis for the remelted heat shall be determined from 
one test sample taken from one remelted ingot, or the product 
of one remelted ingot, from the primary heat. If the heat 
analysis of the primary heat does not conform to the heat 
analysis requirements of the applicable product specification 
for the applicable grade, type, and class, the heat analysis for 
the remelted heat shall be determined from one test sample 
taken from each remelted ingot, or the product of each 
remelted ingot, from the primary heat. 
7.2 Product Analysis-For each heat, the purchaser shall 
have the option of analyzing representative samples taken from 
the finished structural product. Sampling for chemical analysis 
8 
and methods of analysis shall be in accordance with Test 
Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751. The product 
analyses so determined shall conform to the heat analysis 
requirements of the applicable product specification for the 
applicable grade, class, and type, subject to the permitted 
variations in product analysis given in Table A. If a range is 
specified, the determinations of any element in a heat shall not 
vary both above and below the specified range. Rimmed or 
capped steel is characterized by a lack of homogeneity in its 
composition, especially for the elements carbon, phosphorus, 
and sulfur. Therefore, the limitations for these elements shall 
not be applicable unless misapplication is clearly indicated. 
7 .3 Referee Analysis-For referee purposes, Test Methods, 
Practices, and Terminology A751 shall be used. 
7.4 Grade Substitution-Alloy steel grades that meet the 
chemical requirements of Table 1 of Specification A829/ 
A829M shall not be substituted for carbon steel grades. 
8. Metallurgical Structure 
8.1 Where austenitic grain size testing is required, such 
testing shall be in accordance with Test Methods E112 and at 
least 70 % of the grains in the area exaruined shall meet the 
specified grain size requirement. 
8.1.1 Discussion-Austenitic Grain Size-All requirements 
for austenitic grain size control in Section 8, Metallurgical 
Structure, refer to a size of austenite grains that form when and 
if the structural product is reheated to a temperature at or above 
the transformation temperature, Ac 3 , after the product has 
experienced the complete rolling operation and has cooled to 
ambient temperature. The requirements for austenitic grain size 
control in Section 8, including the results of the referenced 
testing methods, do not measure or control the prior austenitic 
grain size or the ferritic grain size of the structural product in 
the as-rolled condition. 
8.2 Coarse Austenitic Grain Size-Where coarse austenitic 
grain size is specified, one austenitic grain size test per heat 
shall be made and the austenitic grain size number so deter­
mined shall be in the range of 1 to 5 inclusive. 
8.3 Fine Austenitic Grain Size: 
8.3.1 Where fine austenitic grain size is specified, except as 
allowed in 8.3.2, one austenitic grain size test per heat shall be 
made and the austenitic grain size number so determined shall 
be 5 or higher.

NoTE 3-See Appendix Xl for definitions of types of pipe. 
1.3 Pipe ordered under this specification is intended for 
mechanical and pressure applications and is also acceptable for 
ordinary uses in steam, water, gas, and air lines. It is suitable 
for welding, and suitable for forming operations involving 
coiling, bending, and flanging, subject to the following quali­
fications: 
1.3.1 Type Fis not intended for flanging. 
1.3.2 If Type S or Type Eis required for close coiling or 
cold bending, Grade A is the preferred grade; however, this is 
not intended to prohibit the cold bending of Grade B pipe. 
1.3.3 Type E is furnished either nonexpanded or cold 
expanded at the option of the manufacturer. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard.

its effectiveness and the inspection procedures. The equipment 
shall be adjusted to produce well-defined indications when the 
reference standard is scanned by the inspection unit in a 
manner simulating the inspection of the product. 
9.1.3 Reference Standards-The length of the reference 
standards shall be determined by the pipe manufacturer, and 
they shall have the same specified diameter and thickness as 
the product being inspected. Reference standards shall contain 
machined notches, one on the inside surface and one on the 
outside surface, or a drilled hole, as shown in Fig. 1, at the 
option of the pipe manufacturer. The notches shall be parallel 
to the weld seam, and shall be separated by a distance sufficient 
to produce two separate and distinguishable signals. The 1 /s-in. 
[3.2-mm] hole shall be drilled through the wall and perpen­
dicular to the surface of the reference standard as shown in Fig. 
1. Care shall be taken in the preparation of the reference 
standard to ensure freedom from fins or other edge roughness, 
or distortion of the pipe.

NOTE 5 (page 62)
NoTE 5-Unless otherwise specified, structural products are normally 
furnished in the as-rolled condition and are subjected to visual inspection 
by the manufacturer or processor. Non-injurious surface or internal 
imperfections, or both, may be present in the structural product as 
delivered and the structural product may require conditioning by the 
purchaser to improve its appearance or in preparation for welding, coating, 
or other further operations. 
More restrictive requirements may be specified by invoking supplemen­
tary requirements or by agreement between the purchaser and the supplier. 
Structural products that exhibit injurious defects during subsequent 
fabrication are deemed not to comply with the applicable product 
specification. (See 17 .2.) Fabricators should be aware that cracks may 
initiate upon bending a sheared or burned edge during the fabrication 
process; this is not considered to be a fault of the steel but is rather a 
function of the induced cold-work or the heat-affected zone. 
The conditioning requirements in 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4 limit the condition­
ing allowed to be performed by the manufacturer or processor. Condition­
ing of imperfections beyond the limits of 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4 may be 
performed by parties other than the manufacturer or processor at the 
discretion of the purchaser. 
9.2 Plate Conditioning: 
9.2.1 The grinding of plates by the manufacturer or proces­
sor to remove imperfections on the top or bottom surface shall 
be subject to the limitations that the area ground is well faired 
without abrupt changes in contour and the grinding does not 
reduce the thickness of the plate by (J) more than 7 % under 
the nominal thickness for plates ordered to weight per square 
foot or mass per square metre, but in no case more than 1/s in. 
[3 mm]; or (2) below the permissible minimum thickness for 
plates ordered to thickness in inches or millimetres. 
9.2.2 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) following the 
removal of imperfections on the top or bottom surface of plates 
by chipping, grinding, or arc-air gouging shall be subject to the 
following limiting conditions: 
9.2.2.l The chipped, ground, or gouged area shall not 
exceed 2 % of the area of the surface being conditioned. 
9.2.2.2 After removal of any imperfections preparatory to 
welding, the thickness of the plate at any location shall not be 
reduced by more than 30 % of the nominal thickness of the 
plate. (Specification A131/A131M restricts the reduction in 
thickness to 20 % maximum.) 
9.2.3 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) following the 
removal of injurious imperfections on the edges of plates by 
grinding, chipping, or arc-air gouging by the manufacturer or 
processor shall be subject to the limitation that, prior to 
welding, the depth of the depression, measured from the plate 
edge inward, is not more than the thickness of the plate or 1 in. 
[25 mm], whichever is the lesser. 
9.3 Structural Size Shapes, Bar Size Shapes, and Sheet 
Piling Conditioning: 
9.3.1 The grinding, or chipping and grinding, of structural 
size shapes, bar size shapes, and sheet piling by the manufac­
turer or processor to remove imperfections shall be subject to 
the limitations that the area ground is well faired without 
abrupt changes in contour and the depression does not extend 
below the rolled surface by more than (J) 1/32 in. [1 mm], for 
material less than 3/s in. [10 mm] in thickness; (2) 1/16 in. [2 
mm], for material 3fs to 2 in. [10 to 50 mm] inclusive in 
thickness; or (3) 1/s in. [3 mm], for material over 2 in. [50 mm] 
in thickness. 
9.3.2 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) following 
removal of imperfections that are greater in depth than the 
limits listed in 9.3.1 shall be subject to the following limiting 
conditions: 
9.3.2.1 The total area of the chipped or ground surface of 
any piece prior to welding shall not exceed 2 % of the total 
surface area of that piece. 
9.3.2.2 The reduction of thickness of the material resulting 
from removal of imperfections prior to welding shall not 
exceed 30 % of the nominal thickness at the location of the 
imperfection, nor shall the depth of depression prior to welding 
exceed 1 ¼ in. [32 mm] in any case except as noted in 9.3.2.3. 
9.3.2.3 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) following 
grinding, chipping, or arc-air gouging of the toes of angles, 
beams, channels, and zees and the stems and toes of tees shall 
be subject to the limitation that, prior to welding, the depth of 
the depression, measured from the toe inward, is not more than 
the thickness of the material at the base of the depression or ½ 
in. [12.5 mm], whichever is the lesser. 
9.3.2.4 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) and grinding 
to correct or build up the interlock of any sheet piling section 
at any location shall be subject to the limitation that the total 
surface area of the weld not exceed 2 % of the total surface 
area of the piece. 
9.4 Bar Conditioning: 
9.4.1 The conditioning of bars by the manufacturer or 
processor to remove imperfections by grinding, chipping, or 
some other means shall be subject to the limitations that the 
conditioned area is well faired and the affected sectional area'is 
not reduced by more than the applicable permitted variations 
.. (see Section 12). 
10 
9.4.2 The deposition of weld metal (see 9.5) following 
chipping or grinding to remove imperfections that are greater 
in depth than the limits listed in 9.4.1 shall be subject to the 
following conditions: 
9.4.2.1 The total area of the chipped or ground surface of 
any piece, prior to welding, shall not exceed 2 % of the total 
surface area of the piece. 
9.4.2.2 The reduction of sectional dimension of a round, 
square, or hexagon bar, or the reduction in thickness of a flat 
bar, resulting from removal of an imperfection, prior to 
welding, shall not exceed 5 % of the nominal dimension or 
thickness at the location of the imperfection. 
9.4.2.3 For the edges of flat bars, the depth of the condi­
tioning depression prior to welding shall be measured from the 
edge inward and shall be limited to a maximum depth equal to 
the thickness of the flat bar or ½ in. [12.5 mm], whichever is 
less. 
9.5 Repair by Welding: 
9.5.1 General Requirements: 
9.5.1.1 Repair by welding shall be in accordance with a 
welding procedure specification (WPS) using shielded metal 
arc welding (SMAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), flux 
cored arc welding (FCAW), or submerged arc welding (SAW) 
processes. Shielding gases used shall be of welding quality. 
9.5.1.2 Electrodes and electrode-flux combinations shall be 
in accordance with the requirements of A WS Specifications 
A5.l/A5.1M, A5.5/A5.5M, A5.17/A5.17M, A5.18/A5.18M,

NOTE 5 (page 138)

NOTE 5 (page 241)
Note 5-The minimum wall thickness on inspection is shown in Table 
Xl.2 of the Appendix. 
12.4 Lengths: 
12.4.1 Except as allowed in 12.4.2, pipe shall be furnished 
in lengths averaging 38 ft [11.6 m] or over, with a minimum 
length of 20 ft [6.1 m], but no more than 5 % may be under 32 
ft [9.8 m]. Jointers made by welding are permissible. When 
threaded pipe is ordered, jointers shall be made by threaded 
connections and shall not exceed 5 % of the order. 
12.4.2 Unless otherwise specified, Schedule 10 pipe shall be 
between 16 and 22 ft [4.9 and 6.7 m] for a minimum of 90 % 
of the footage furnished, with any balance being shorter 
lengths at least 8 ft [2.4 m] long. 
13. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
13.1 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight and free 
of defects. Surface imperfections in excess of 12.5 % of the 
nominal wall thickness shall be considered defects. 
13.2 End Finish: 
13.2.1 Schedule JO Pipe-Pipe furnished to Schedule 10 
shall be plain end only. All inside and outside cutting burrs 
shall be removed. This generally involves breaking the comers. 
13.2.2 Ends, Plain End Pipe-Unless otherwise specified, 
plain end pipe for use with the Dresser or Dayton type coupling 
shall be reamed both outside and inside sufficiently to remove 
all burrs. Plain end pipe for welding shall be beveled on the 
outside to an angle of 30° with a tolerance of+ 5° and - 0° and 
with a width of flat at the end of the pipe of 1/16 ± ½2 in. [1.6 
± 0.8 mm]. When material is ordered beveled to any other than 
a 30° angle, it should be understood that the angle is to be 
measured from a line drawn perpendicular to the axis of the 
pipe. This means that a greater amount of material is removed 
with a 60° angle than with a 30° angle. Pipe shall be 
sufficiently free from indentations, projections, or roll marks 
for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] from the end of the pipe to 
make a tight joint with the rubber gasket type of coupling. All 
plain end pipe intended for Dresser or Dayton type joints or for 
welding, sizes NPS 10 [DN 250] and smaller in outside 
diameter specified, shall be not more than 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] 
smaller than the outside diameter specified for a distance of 8 
in. [200 mm] from the ends of the pipe and shall permit the 
passing for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] of a ring gauge that has 
a bore 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] larger than the outside diameter 
specified of the pipe. Sizes larger than NPS 10 [DN 250] shall 
be not more than 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] smaller than the nominal 
outside diameter for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] from the end 
of the pipe and shall permit the passing for a distance of 8 in. 
[200 mm] of a ring gauge which has a bore 3/32 in. [2.4 mm] 
larger than the nominal outside diameter of the pipe. 
189 
13.2.3 Ends, Threaded Pipe-Each end of threaded pipe 
shall be reamed to remove all burrs. All threads shall be in 
accordance with the American National Standard Pipe Threads

NoTE 9-The industry definition as invoked here is: EDI is the 
computer to computer exchange of business information in a standard 
format such as ANSI ASC Xl2. 
15. Inspection and Testing 
15.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
free entry, at all times, while work on the contract of the 
purchaser is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's 
works that concern the manufacture of the structural product 
ordered. The manufacturer shall afford the inspector all rea­
sonable facilities to be satisfied that the structural product is 
being furnished in accordance with this general requirements 
specification, the applicable product specification, and the 
purchase order. All tests (except product analysis) and inspec­
tion shall be made at the place of manufacture prior to 
shipment, unless otherwise specified, and shall be conducted so 
as not to interfere with the operation of the manufacturer's 
works. 
15.2 Where structural products are produced from coil, 15.1 
shall apply to the processor instead of the manufacturer, and 
the place of process shall apply instead of the place of 
manufacture. Where structural products are produced from coil 
and the processor is different from the manufacturer, the 
inspector representing the purchaser shall have free entry at all 
times while work on the contract of the purchaser is being 
performed to all parts of the manufacturer's works that concern 
the manufacture of the structural product ordered. 
16 
16. Retreatment 
16.1 If any heat-treated structural product fails to meet the 
mechanical property requirements of the applicable product 
specification, the manufacturer or the processor shall have the 
option of heat treating the structural product again. All me­
chanical property tests shall be repeated and the structural 
product shall be reexamined for surface defects when it is 
resubmitted for inspection. 
17. Rejection 
17 .1 Any rejection based upon product analysis made in 
accordance with the applicable product specification shall be 
reported to the supplier and samples that represent the rejected 
structural product shall be preserved for two weeks from the 
date of notification of such rejection. In case of dissatisfaction 
with the results of the tests, the supplier shall have the option 
of making claim for a rehearing within that time. 
17.2 The purchaser shall have the option of rejecting struc­
tural product that exhibits injurious defects subsequent to its 
acceptance at the manufacturer's or processor's works, and so 
notifying the manufacturer or processor. 
18. Identification of Structural Products 
18.1 Required Plate Markings: 
18.1.1 Except as allowed by 18.1.4.2 and 18.6, plates shall 
be legibly marked with the following: applicable ASTM 
designation (see 1.1) (year-date not required); "G" or "MT" if 
applicable (see 18.1.2); applicable grade; heat number; size and 
thickness; and name, brand, or trademark of the manufacturer 
(for plates produced from an as-rolled structural product) or the 
processor (for plates produced from coil). 
18.1.2 Plates that are required to be heat treated, but have 
not been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the manufacturer 
or processor, with the letter "G" (denoting green) following the 
required ASTM designation mark, except that "G" marking is 
not necessary if such plates are for shipment, for the purpose of 
obtaining the required heat treatment, to an organization under 
the manufacturer's control. Such plates shall have been quali­
fied for shipment on the basis of test specimens that have been 
so heat treated. Plates that are required to be heat treated, and 
have been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the party that 
performed the heat treatment, with the letter "MT" (denoting 
material treated) following the required ASTM designation 
mark. 
18.1.3 Except as allowed by 18.1.4.2 and 18.6, the required 
markings for plates shall be by steel die stamping, paint 
marking, or by means of permanently affixed, colorfast, 
weather-resistant labels or tags. It shall be the responsibility of 
the supplier that all required markings be intact and fully 
legible upon receipt by the purchaser. 
18.1.4 Location of Markings: 
18.1.4.1 The required markings for plates shall be in at least 
one place on each finished plate. 
18.1.4.2 For secured lifts of all sizes of plates 3/s in. [10 mm] 
(or 5 /16 in. [8 mm] for material specified for bridge construction 
end use) or under in thickness, and for secured lifts of all 
thicknesses of plates 36 in. [900 mm] or under in width, the 
manufacturer or processor shall have the option of placing such

NOTE 10 (page 69)
NoTE 10-Bar coding should be consistent with AIAG Standards. 
18.6 Subdivided Material: 
18.6.1 Except as allowed by 18.6.2, pieces separated from 
a master structural product by an organization other than the 
original manufacturer shall be identified with the ASTM 
designation (year-date not required), grade, heat number, and 
the heat treatment identification, if applicable, along with the 
trademark, brand, or name of the organization subdividing the 
structural product. The identification methods shall be in 
accordance with the requirements of 18.1 - 18.4 inclusive,
