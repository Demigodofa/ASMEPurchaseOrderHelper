Test Methods and Definitions for 
Mechanical Testing of Steel Products 
1. Scope 
1. 1 These test methods cover procedures and definitions 
for the mechanical testing of steels, stainless steels, and related 
alloys. The various mechanical tests herein described are used 
to determine properties required in the product specifications. 
Variations in testing methods are to be avoided, and standard 
methods of testing are to be followed to obtain reproducible 
and comparable results. In those cases in which the testing 
requirements for certain products are unique or at variance with 
these general procedures, the product specification testing 
requirements shall control. 
1.2 The following mechanical tests are described:

1.4 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as standard. The values given in parentheses are mathematical 
conversions to SI units that are provided for information only 
and are not considered standard. 
1.5 When these test methods are referenced in a metric 
product specification, the yield and tensile values may be 
determined in inch-pound (ksi) units then converted into SI 
(MPa) units. The elongation determined in inch-pound gauge 
lengths of 2 or 8 in. may be reported in SI unit gauge lengths 
of 50 or 200 mm, respectively, as applicable. Conversely, when 
these test methods are referenced in an inch-pound product 
specification, the yield and tensile values may be detennined in 
SI units then converted into inch-pound units. The elongation 
determined in SI unit gauge lengths of 50 or 200 mm may be 
reported in inch-pound gauge lengths of 2 or 8 in., respectively, 
as applicable. 
584 
1.5.1 The specimen used to detennine the original units 
must conform to the applicable tolerances of the original unit 
system given in the dimension table not that of the converted 
tolerance dimensions. 
Norn I-This is due to the specimen SI dimensions and tolerances 
being hard conversions when this is not a dual standard. The user is 
directed to Test Methods A1058 if the tests are required in SI units. 
1.6 Attention is directed to ISO/IEC 17025 when there may 
be a need for information on criteria for evaluation of testing 
laborat01ies. 
1. 7 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3.l Definitions: 
3.1.1 For definitions of terms pertaining to mechanical 
testing of steel products not otherwise listed in this section, 
reference should be made to Terminology E6 and Terminology 
A941. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2. l longitudinal test, n-unless specifically defined 
otherwise, signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is 
parallel to the direction of the greatest extension of the steel 
during rolling or forging. 
3.2.1.1 Discussion-The stress applied to a longitudinal 
tension test specimen is in the direction of the greatest 
extension, and the axis of the fold of a longitudinal bend test 
specimen is at right angles to the direction of greatest extension 
(see Fig. 1, Fig. 2a, and Fig. 2b). 
3.2.2 radial test, n-unless specifically defined otherwise, 
signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is perpen­
dicular to the axis of the product and coincident with one of the 
radii of a circle drawn with a point on the axis of the product 
as a center (see Fig. 2a). 
3.2.3 tangential test, n-unless specifically defined 
otherwise, signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen 
perpendicular to a plane containing the axis of the product and 
tangent to a circle drawn with a point on the axis of the 
productas a center (see Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b, Fig. 2c, and Fig. 2d). 
3.2.4 transition temperature, n-for specification purposes, 
the transition temperature is the temperature at which the 
designated material test value equals or exceeds a specified 
minimum test value. 
3.2.4.1 Discussion-Some of the many definitions of tran­
sition temperature currently being used are: ( 1) the lowest 
temperature at which the specimen exhibits 100 % fibrous 
fracture, (2) the tei;nperature where the fracture shows a 50 % 
crystalline and a 50 % fibrous appearance, ( 3) the temperature 
corresponding to the energy value 50 % of the difference

3.3 Definition of Terms Specific to the Procedure for Use 
and Control of Heat-cycle Simulation (See Annex A9): 
3.3.1 master chart, n-a record of the heat treatment re­
ceived from a forging essentially identical to the production 
forgings that it will represent. 
3.3.1.1 Discussion-It is a chart of time and temperature 
showing the output from thermocouples imbedded in the 
forging at the designated test immersion and test location or 
locations. 
3.3.2 program chart, n-the metallized sheet used to pro­
gram the simulator unit. 
3.3.2.1 Discussion-Time-temperature data from the master 
chart are manually transferred to the program chart. 
3.3.3 simulator chart, n-a record of the heat treatment that 
a test specimen had received in the simulator unit. 
3.3.3.1 Discussion-It is a chart of time and temperature 
and can be compared directly to the master chart for accuracy 
of duplication. 
3.3.4 simulator cycle, n-one continuous heat treatment of a 
set of specimens in the simulator nnit. 
3.3.4.l Discussion-The cycle includes heating from 
ambient, holding at temperature, and cooling. For example, a 
simulated austenitize and quench of a set of specimens would 
be one cycle; a simulated temper of the same specimens would 
be another cycle. 
4. Significance and Use 
4.1 The primary use of these test methods is testing to 
determine the specified mechanical properties of steel, stainless 
steel, and related alloy products for the evaluation of confor­
mance of such products to a material specification under the 
jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AOl and its subcommittees as 
designated by a purchaser in a purchase order or contract. 
4.1.1 These test methods may be and are used by other 
ASTM Committees and other standards writing bodies for the 
purpose of conformance testing. 
4.1.2 The material condition at the time of testing, sampling 
frequency, specimen location and orientation, reporting 
requirements, and other test parameters are contained in the 
pertinent material specification or in a general requirement 
specification for the particular product form. 
4.1.3 Some material specifications require the use of addi­
tional test methods not described herein; in such cases, the 
required test method is described in that material specification 
or by reference to another appropriate test method standard. 
4.2 These test methods are also suitable to be used for 
testing of steel, stainless steel and related alloy materials for 
other purposes, such as incoming material acceptance testing 
by the purchaser or evaluation of components after service 
exposure. 
4.2.1 As with any mechanical testing, deviations from either 
specification limits or expected as-manufactured properties can 
occur for valid reasons besides deficiency of the original 
as-fabricated product. These reasons include, but are not 
limited to: subsequent service degradation from environmental 
exposure (for example, temperature, corrosion); static or cyclic 
service stress effects, mechanically-induced damage, material 
inhomogeneity, anisotropic structure, natural aging of select 
alloys, further processing not included in the specification, 
sampling limitations, and measuring equipment calibration 
uncertainty. There is statistical variation in all aspects of 
mechanical testing and variations in test results from prior tests 
are expected. An understanding of possible reasons for devia­
tion from specified or expected test values should be applied in 
interpretation of test results. 
5. General Precautions 
5 .1 Certain methods of fabrication, such as bending, 
forming, and welding, or operations involving heating, may 
affect the properties of the material under test. Therefore, the 
product specifications cover the stage of manufacture at which 
mechanical testing is to be performed. The properties shown by 
testing p1ior to fabrication may not necessarily be representa­
tive of the product after it has been completely fabricated. 
5.2 Improperly machined specimens should be discarded 
and other specimens substituted. 
5.3 Flaws in the specimen may also affect results. If any test 
specimen develops flaws, the retest provision of the applicable 
product specification shall govern. 
5.4 If any test specimen fails because of mechanical reasons 
such as failure of testing equipment or improper specimen 
preparation, it may be discarded and another specimen taken. 
6. Orientation of Test Specimens 
6.1 The terms "longitudinal test" and "transverse test" are 
used only in material specifications for wrought products and 
are not applicable to castings. When such reference is made to 
a test coupon or test specimen, see Section 3 for terms and 
definitions. 
TENSION TEST 
7. Description 
7 .1 The tension test related to the mechanical testing of steel 
products subjects a machined or full-section specimen of the 
material under examination to a measured load sufficient to 
cause rupture. The resulting properties sought are defined in 
Terminology E6. 
587 
7.2 In general, the testing equipment and methods are given 
in Test Methods E8/E8M. However, there are certain excep­
tions to Test Methods E8/E8M practices in the testing of steel, 
and these are covered in these test methods. 
8. Testing Apparatus and Operations 
8.1 Loading Systems-There are two general types of load­
ing systems, mechanical (screw power) and hydraulic. These 
differ chiefly in the vaiiability of the rate of load application. 
The older screw power machines are limited to a small number 
of fixed free running crosshead speeds. Some modern screw 
power machines, and all hydraulic machines permit stepless 
variation throughout the range of speeds. 
8.2 The tension testing machine shall be maintained in good 
operating condition, used only in the proper loading range, and 
calibrated periodically in accordance with the latest revision of 
Practices E4.

=== Page 640 ===

SA-370 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Norn 2-Many machines are equipped with stress-strain recorders for 
autographic plotting of stress-strain curves. It should be noted that some 
recorders have a load measuring component entirely separate from the 
load indicator of the testing machine. Such recorders are calibrated 
separately. 
8.3 Loading-It is the function of the gripping or holding 
device of the testing machine to transmit the load from the 
heads of the machine to the specimen under test. The essential 
requirement is that the load shall be transmitted axially. This 
implies that the centers of the action of the grips shall be in 
alignment, insofar as practicable, with the axis of the specimen 
at the beginning and during the test and that bending or 
twisting be held to a minimum. For specimens with a reduced 
section, gripping of the specimen shall be restricted to the grip 
section. In the case of certain sections tested in full size, 
nonaxial loading is unavoidable and in such cases shall be 
permissible. 
8.4 Speed of Testing-The speed of testing shall not be 
greater than that at which load and strain readings can be made 
accurately. In production testing, speed of testing is commonly 
expressed: (l) in terms of free nmning crosshead speed (rate of 
movement of the crosshead of the testing machine when not 
under load), (2) in terms of rate of separation of the two heads 
of the testing machine under load, (3) in terms of rate of 
stressing the specimen, or (4) in terms of rate of straining the 
specimen. The following limitations on the speed of testing are 
recommended as adequate for most steel products: 
Norn 3-Tension tests using closed-loop machines (with feedback 
control of rate) should not be performed using load control, as this mode 
of testing will result in acceleration of the crosshead upon yielding and 
elevation of the measured yield strength. 
8.4.1 Any convenient speed of testing may be used up to 
one half the specified yield point or yield strength. When this 
point is reached, the free-running rate of separation of the 
crossheads shall be adjusted so as not to exceed 1/16 in. per min 
per inch of reduced section, or the distance between the grips 
for test specimens not having reduced sections. This speed 
shall be maintained through the yield point or yield strength. In 
detennining the tensile strength, the free-running rate of 
separation of the heads shall not exceed ½ in. per min per inch 
of reduced section, or the distance between the grips for test 
specimens not having reduced sections. In any event, the 
minimum speed of testing shall not be less than 1/10 the 
specified maximum rates for determining yield point or yield 
strength and tensile strength. 
8.4.2 It shall be permissible to set the speed of the testing 
machine by adjusting the free running crosshead speed to the 
above specified values, inasmuch as the rate of separation of 
heads under load at these machine settings is less than the 
specified values of free running crosshead speed. 
8.4.3 As an alternative, if the machine is equipped with a 
device to indicate the rate of loading, the speed of the machine 
from half the specified yield point or yield strength through the 
yield point or yield strength may be adjusted so that the rate of 
stressing does not exceed 100 000 psi (690 MPa)/min. 
However, the minimum rate of stressing shall not be less than 
10 000 psi (70 MPa)/min. 
9. Test Specimen Parameters 
9.1 Selection-Test coupons shall be selected in accordance 
with the applicable product specifications. 
9.1.1 Wrought Steels-Wrought steel products are usually 
tested in the longitudinal direction, but in some cases, where 
size permits and the service justifies it, testing is in the 
transverse, radial, or tangential directions (see Figs. 1 and 2). 
9.1.2 Forged Steels-For open die forgings, the metal for 
tension testing is usually provided by allowing extensions or 
prolongations on one or both ends of the forgings, either on all 
or a representative number as provided by the applicable 
product specifications. Test specimens are normally taken at 
mid-radius. Certain product specifications permit the use of a 
representative bar or the destruction of a production part for 
test purposes. For ring or disk-like forgings test metal is 
provided by increasing the diameter, thickness, or length of the 
forging. Upset disk or ring forgings, which are worked or 
extended by forging in a direction perpendicular to the axis of 
the forging, usually have their principal extension along 
concentric circles and for such forgings tangential tension 
specimens are obtained from extra metal on the periphery or 
end of the forging. For some forgings, such as rotors, radial 
tension tests are required. In such cases the specimens are cut 
or trepanned from specified locations. 
9.2 Size and Tolerances-Test specimens shall be (I) the 
full cross section of material, or (2) machined to the form and 
dimensions shown in Figs. 3-6. The selection of size and type 
of specimen is prescribed by the applicable product specifica­
tion. Full cross section specimens shall be tested in 8-in. 
(200 mm) gauge length unless otherwise specified in the 
product specification. 
9.3 Procurement of Test Specimens-Specimens shall be 
extracted by any convenient method taking care to remove all 
distorted, cold-worked, or heat-affected areas from the edges of 
the section used in evaluating the material. Specimens usually 
have a reduced cross section at mid-length to ensure uniform 
distribution of the stress over the cross section and localize the 
zone of fracture. 
588 
9.4 Aging of Test Specimens-Unless otherwise specified, it 
shall be permissible to age tension test specimens. The time­
temperature cycle employed must be such that the effects of 
previous processing will not be materially changed. It may be 
accomplished by aging at room temperature 24 to 48 h, or in 
shorter time at moderately elevated temperatures by boiling in 
water, heating in oil or in an oven. 
9.5 Measurement of Dimensions of Test Specimens: 
9 .5 .1 Standard Rectangular Tension Test Specimens-These 
forms of specimens are shown in Fig. 3. To determine the 
cross-sectional area, the center width dimension shall be 
measured to the nearest 0.005 in. (0.13 mm) for the 8-in. (200 
mm) gauge length specimen and 0.001 in. (0.025 mm) for the 
2-in. (50 mm) gauge length specimen in Fig. 3. The center 
thickness dimension shall be measured to the nearest 0.001 in. 
for both specimens. 
9.5.2 Standard Round Tension Test Specimens-These 
forms of specimens are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. To 
determine the cross-sectional area, the diameter shall be

NoTE 1-For the 1½-in. (40 mm) wide specimens, punch marks for measuring elongation after fracture shall be made on the flat or on the edge of 
the specimen and within the reduced section. For the 8-in. (200 mm) gauge length specimen, a set of nine or more punch marks 1 in. (25 mm) apart, 
or one or more pairs of punch marks 8 in. (200 mm) apart may be used. For the 2-in. (50 IIlln) gauge length specimen, a set of three or more punch marks 
1 in. (25 IIlln) apart, or one or more pairs of punch marks 2 in. (50 mm) apart may be used. 
NoTE 2-For the ½-in. (12.5 mm) wide specimen, punch marks for measuring the elongation after fracture shall be made on the flat or on the edge 
of the specimen and within the reduced section. Either a set of three or more punch marks 1 in. (25 mm) apart or one or more pairs of punch marks 2 in. 
(50 mm) apart may be used. 
NoTE 3-For the four sizes of specimens, the ends of the reduced section shall not differ in width by more than 0.004, 0.004, 0.002, or 0.001 in. (0.10, 
0.10, 0.05, or 0.025 mm), respectively. Also, there may be a gradual decrease in width from the ends to the center, but the width at either end shall not 
be more than 0.015 in., 0.015 in., 0.005 in., or 0.003 in. (0.40, 0.40, 0.10, or 0.08 mm), respectively, larger than the width at the center. 
NoTE 4--For each specimen type, the radii of all fillets shall be equal to each other with a tolerance of 0.05 in. (1.25 mm), and the centers of curvature 
of the two fillets at a particular end shall be located across from each other (on a line perpendicular to the centerline) within a tolerance of 0.10 in. 
(2.5 mm). 
NoTE 5-For each of the four sizes of specimens, narrower widths (W and C) may be used when necessary. In such cases, the width of the reduced 
section should be as large as the width of the material being tested permits; however, unless stated specifically, the requirements for elongation in a product 
specification shall not apply when these narrower specimens are used. If the width of the material is less than W, the sides may be parallel throughout 
the length of the specimen. 
NoTE 6--The specimen may be modified by making the sides parallel throughout the length of the specimen, the width and tolerances being the same 
as those specified above. When necessary, a narrower specimen may be used, in which case the width should be as great as the width of the material being 
tested permits. If the width is 1 ½ in. (38 mm) or less, the sides may be parallel throughout the length of the specimen. 
NoTE 7-The dimension Tis the thickness of the test specimen as provided for in the applicable product specification. Minimum nominal thickness 
of 1 to 1 ½-in. ( 40 mm) wide specimens shall be 3/16 in. (5 mm), except as permitted by the product specification. Maximum nominal thickness of ½-in. 
(12.5 mm) and ¼-in. (6 mm) wide specimens shall be 1 in. (25 mm) and ¼ in. (6 mm), respectively. 
NoTE 8-To aid in obtaining axial loading during testing of ¼-in. (6 mm) wide specimens, the overall length should be as large as the material will 
permit. 
NoTE 9-It is desirable, if possible, to make the length of the grip section large enough to allow the specimen to extend into the grips a distance equal 
to two thirds or more of the length of the grips. If the thickness of ½-in. (13 mm) wide specimens is over 3 /s in. (10 mm), longer grips and correspondingly 
longer grip sections of the specimen may be necessary to prevent failure in the grip section. 
NoTE 10-For standard sheet-type specimens and subsize specimens, the ends of the specimen shall be symmetrical with the center line of the reduced 
section within 0.01 and 0.005 in. (0.25 and 0.13 mm), respectively, except that for steel if the ends of the ½-in. (12.5 mm) wide specimen are symmetrical 
within 0.05 in. (1.0 mm), a specimen may be considered satisfactory for all but referee testing. 
NoTE 11-For standard plate-type specimens, the ends of the specimen shall be symmetrical with the center line of the reduced section within 0.25 in. 
(6.35 mm), except for referee testing in which case the ends of the specimen shall be symmetrical with the center line of the reduced section within 0.10 in. 
(2.5 mm).

(Note 2) 
Norn 1-The reduced section may have a gradual taper from the ends toward the ceuter, with the ends not more than 1 % larger in diameter than the 
center (controlling dimension). 
Norn 2-If desired, the length of the reduced section may be increased to accommodate an extensometer of any convenient gauge length. Reference 
marks for the measurement of elongation should, nevertheless, be spaced at the indicated gauge length. 
Norn 3-The gauge length and fillets shall be as shown, but the ends may be of any form to fit the holders of the testing machine in such a way that 
the load shall be axial (see Fig. 9). If the ends are to be held in wedge grips it is desirable, if possible, to make the length of the grip section great enough 
to allow the specimen to extend into the grips a distance equal to two thirds or more of the length of the grips. 
Norn 4-On the round specimens in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, the gauge lengths are equal to four times the nominal diameter. In some product specifications 
other specimens may be provided for, but unless the 4-to-1 ratio is maintained within dimensional tolerances, the elongation values may not be comparable 
with those obtained from the standard test specimen. 
Norn 5-The use of specimens smaller than 0.250-in. (6.25 mm) diameter shall be restricted to cases when the material to be tested is of insufficient 
size to obtain larger specimens or when all parties agree to their use for acceptance testing. Smaller specimens require suitable equipment and greater 
skill in both machining and testing. 
Norn 6-Five sizes of specimens often used have diameters of approximately 0.505, 0.357, 0.252, 0.160, and 0.113 in., the reason being to permit easy 
calculations of stress from loads, since the corresponding cross sectional areas are equal or close to 0.200, 0.100, 0.0500, 0.0200, and 0.0100 in.2, 
respectively. Thus, when the actual diameters agree with these values, the stresses (or strengths) may be computed using the simple multiplying factors 
5, 10, 20, 50, and 100, respectively. (The metric equivalents of these fixed diameters do not result in correspondingly convenient cross sectional area and 
multiplying factors.) 
FIG. 4 Standard 0.500-in. (12.5 mm) Round Tension Test Specimen With 2-in. (50 mm) Gauge Length and Examples of Small-size Speci­
mens Proportional to Standard Specimens 
measured at the center of the gauge length to the nearest 
0.001 in. (0.025 mm) (see Table 1). 
9.6 General-Test specimens shall be either substantially 
full size or machined, as prescribed in the product specifica­
tions for the material being tested. 
9.6. l It is desirable to have the cross-sectional area of the 
specimen smallest at the center of the gauge length to ensure 
fracture within the gauge length. This is provided for by the 
taper in the gauge length permitted for each of the specimens 
described in the following sections. 
9.6.2 For brittle materials it is desirable to have fillets of 
large radius at the ends of the gauge length. 
10. Plate-type Specimens 
10.1 The standard plate-type test specimens are shown in 
Fig. 3. Such specimens are used for testing metallic materials 
in the form of plate, strnctural and bar-size shapes, and flat 
material having a nominal thickness of 3/16 in. (5 mm) or over. 
When product specifications so permit, other types of speci­
mens may be used. 
Norn 4-When called for in the product specification, the 8-in. (200 
590 
mm) gauge length specimen of Fig. 3 may be used for sheet and strip 
material. 
11. Sheet-type Specimen 
11.1 The standard sheet-type test specimen is shown in Fig. 
3. This specimen is used for testing metallic materials in the 
form of sheet, plate, flat wire, strip, band, and hoop ranging in 
nominal thickness from 0.005 to 1 in. (0.13 to 25 mm). When 
product specifications so permit, other types of specimens may 
be used, as provided in Section 10 (see Note 4). 
12. Round Specimens 
12.1 The standard 0.500-in. (12.5 mm) diameter round test 
specimen shown in Fig. 4 is frequently used for testing metallic 
materials. 
12.2 Fig. 4 also shows small size specimens proportional to 
the standard specimen. These may be used when it is necessary 
to test material from which the standard specimen or specimens 
shown in Fig. 3 cannot be prepared. Other sizes of small round 
specimens may be used. In any such small size specimen it is 
important that the gauge length for measurement of elongation 
be four times the diameter of the specimen (see Note 5, Fig. 4).

A The values in parentheses may be used for ease in calculation of stresses, in pounds per square inch, as permitted in Note 5 of Fig. 4. 
12.3 The type of specimen ends outside of the gauge length 
shall accommodate the shape of the product tested, and shall 
properly fit the holders or grips of the testing machine so that 
axial loads are applied with a minimum of load eccentricity and 
slippage. Fig. 5 shows specimens with various types of ends 
that have given satisfactory results. 
13. Gauge Marks 
13.1 The specimens shown in Figs. 3-6 shall be gauge 
marked with a center punch, scribe marks, multiple device, or 
drawn with ink. The purpose of these gauge marks is to 
determine the percent elongation. Punch marks shall be light, 
sharp, and accurately spaced. The localization of stress at the 
marks makes a hard specimen susceptible to starting fracture at 
the punch marks. The gauge marks for measuring elongation 
after fracture shall be made on the flat or on the edge of the flat 
tension test specimen and within the parallel section; for the 
8-in. gauge length specimen, Fig. 3, one or more sets of 8-in. 
gauge marks may be used, intermediate marks within the gauge 
length being optional. Rectangular 2-in. gauge length 
specimens, Fig. 3, and round specimens, Fig. 4, are gauge 
marked with a double-pointed center punch or scribe marks. 
One or more sets of gauge marks may be used; however, one 
592 
set must be approximately centered in the reduced section. 
These same precautions shall be observed when the test 
specimen is full section. 
14. Determination of Tensile Properties 
14.1 Yield Point-Yield point is the first stress in a material, 
less than the maximum obtainable stress, at which an increase 
in strain occurs without an increase in stress. Yield point is 
intended for application only for materials that may exhibit the 
unique characteristic of showing an increase in strain without 
an increase in stress. The stress-strain diagram is characterized 
by a sharp knee or discontinuity. Determine yield point by one 
of the following methods: 
14.1.1 Drop of Beam or Halt of Pointer Method-In this 
method, apply an increasing load to the specimen at a uniform 
rate. When a lever and poise machine is used, keep the beam in 
balance by running out the poise at approximately a steady 
rate. When the yield point of the material is reached, the 
increase of the load will stop, but nm the poise a trifle beyond 
the balance position, and the beam of the machine will drop for 
a brief but appreciable interval of time. When a machine 
equipped with a load-indicating dial is used there is a halt or 
hesitation of the load-indicating pointer corresponding to the

=== Page 645 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-370 
drop of the beam. Note the load at the "drop of the beam" or 
the "halt of the pointer" and record the corresponding stress as 
the yield point. 
14.1.2 Autographic Diagram Method-When a sharp-kneed 
stress-strain diagram is obtained by an autographic recording 
device, take the stress corresponding to the top of the knee 
(Fig. 7), or the stress at which the curve drops as the yield 
point. 
14.1.3 Total Extension Under Load Method-When testing 
material for yield point and the test specimens may not exhibit 
a well-defined disproportionate deformation that characterizes 
a yield point as measured by the drop of the beam, halt of the 
pointer, or antographic diagram methods described in 14.1.1 
and 14.1.2, a value equivalent to the yield point in its practical 
significance may be determined by the following method and 
may be recorded as yield point: Attach a Class C or better 
extensometer (Notes 5 and 6) to the specimen. When the load 
producing a specified extension (Note 7) is reached record the 
stress corresponding to the load as the yield point (Fig. 8). 
Norn 5-Automatic devices are available that determine the load at the 
specified total extension without plotting a stress-strain curve. Such 
devices may be used if their accuracy has been demonstrated. Multiplying 
calipers and other such devices are acceptable for use provided their 
accuracy has been demonstrated as equivalent to a Class C extensometer. 
Norn 6-Reference should be made to Practice E83. 
Norn 7-For steel with a yield point specified not over 80 000 psi 
(550 MPa), an appropriate value is 0.005 in.fin. of gauge length. For 
values above 80 000 psi, this method is not valid unless the limiting total 
extension is increased. 
Norn 8-The shape of the initial portion of an autographically 
determined stress-strain (or a load-elongation) curve may be influenced by 
numerous factors such as the seating of tl1e specimen in the grips, the 
straightening of a specimen bent due to residual stresses, and the rapid 
loading permitted in 8.4.1. Generally, the abem1tions in this portion of the 
curve should be ignored when fitting a modulus line, such as that used to 
determine the extension-under-load yield, to the curve. In practice, for a 
number of reasons, the straight-line portion of the stress-strain curve may 
not go through the origin of the stress-strain diagram. In these cases it is 
not the origin of the stress-strain diagram, but rather where the straight­
line portion of the stress-strain curve, intersects the strain axis that is 
pertinent. All offsets and extensions should be calculated from the 
intersection of the strai.ght-line portion of the stress-strain curve with the 
strain axis, and not necessarily from the origin of the stress-strain diagram. 
See also Test Methods E8/E8M, Note 32. 
14.2 Yield Strength-Yield strength is the stress at which a 
material exhibits a specified limiting deviation from the pro­
portionality of stress to strain. The deviation is expressed in 
terms of strain, percent offset, total extension under load, and 
so forth. Determine yield strength by one of the following 
methods: 
14.2.1 Offset Method-To determine the yield strength by 
the "offset method," it is necessary to secure data (autographic 
or numerical) from which a stress-strain diagram with a distinct 
modulus characteristic of the material being tested may be 
drawn. Then on the stress-strain diagram (Fig. 9) lay off Om 
equal to the specified value of the offset, draw mn parallel to 
OA, and thus locate r, the intersection of mn with the 
stress-strain curve corresponding to load R, which is the 
yield-strength load. In recording values of yield strength 
obtained by this method, the value of offset specified or used, 
or both, shall be stated in parentheses after the term yield 
strength, for example: 
Yield strength ( 0.2 % offset) = 52 000 psi ( 360 MPa) ( 1) 
When the offset is 0.2 % or larger, the extensometer used 
shall qualify as a Class B2 device over a strain range of 0.05 to 
1.0 %. If a smaller offset is specified, it may be necessary to 
specify a more accurate device (that is, a Class Bl device) or 
reduce the lower limit of the strain range (for example, to 
0.01 %) or both. See also Note 10 for automatic devices. 
Norn 9-For stress-strain diagrams not containing a distinct modulus, 
such as for some cold-worked materials, it is recommended that the 
extension under load method be utilized. If the offset method is used for 
materials without a distinct modulus, a modulus value appropriate for the 
material being tested should be used: 30 000 000 psi (207 000 MPa) for 
carbon steel; 29 000 000 psi (200 000 MPa) for ferritic stainless steel; 
28 000 000 psi (193 000 MPa) for austenitic stainless steel. For special 
alloys, the producer should be contacted to discuss appropriate modulus 
values. 
14.2.2 Extension Under Load Method-For tests to deter­
mine the acceptance or rejection of material whose stress-strain 
characteristics are well known from previous tests of similar 
material in which stress-strain diagrams were plotted, the total 
strain corresponding to the stress at which the specified offset 
(see Notes 10 and 11) occurs will be known within satisfactory 
limits. The stress on the specimen, when this total strain is 
reached, is the value of the yield strength. In recording values 
of yield strength obtained by this method, the value of 
"extension" specified or used, or both, shall be stated in 
parentheses after the term yield strength, for example: 
593 
Yield strength (0.5 % EUL) = 52000 psi (360 MPa) (2) 
The total strain can be obtained satisfactorily by use of a 
Class Bl extensometer (Note 5, Note 6, and Note 8). 
Norn 10-Automatic devices are available that determine offset yield 
strength without plotting a stress-strain curve. Such devices may be used 
if their accuracy has been demonstrated. 
Norn 11-The appropriate magnitude of the extension under load will 
obviously vary with the strength range of the particular steel under test. In 
general, the value of extension under load applicable to steel at any 
strength level may be determined from the sum of the proportional strain 
and the plastic strain expected at the specified yield strength. The 
following equation is used: 
Extension under load, in.fin. of gauge length= (YS/ E) + r (3) 
where: 
YS = specified yield strength, psi or MPa, 
E = modulus of elasticity, psi or MPa, and 
r = limiting plastic strain, in.fin. 
14.3 Tensile Strength-Calculate the tensile strength by 
dividing the maximum load the specimen sustains during a 
tension test by the original cross-sectional area of the speci­
men. If the upper yield strength is the maximum stress 
recorded and if the stress-strain curve resembles that of Test 
Methods E8/E8M-15a Fig. 25, the maximum stress after 
discontinuous yielding shall be reported as the tensile strength 
unless otherwise stated by the purchaser. 
14.4 Elongation: 
14.4.1 Fit the ends of the fractured specimen together 
carefully and measure the distance between the gauge marks to 
the nearest 0.01 in. (0.25 mm) for gauge lengths of 2 in. and 
under, and to the nearest 0.5 % of the gauge length for gauge

=== Page 646 ===

SA-370 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
lengths over 2 in. A percentage scale reading to 0.5 % of the 
gauge length may be used. The elongation is the increase in 
length of the gauge length, expressed as a percentage of the 
01iginal gauge length. In recording elongation values, give both 
the percentage increase and the original gauge length. 
14.4.2 If any part of the fracture takes place outside of the 
middle half of the gauge length or in a punched or scribed mark 
within the reduced section, the elongation value obtained may 
not be representative of the material. If the elongation so 
measured meets the minimum requirements specified, no 
further testing is indicated, but if the elongation is less than the 
minimum requirements, discard the test and retest. 
14.4.3 Automated tensile testing methods using extensom­
eters allow for the measurement of elongation in a method 
described below. Elongation may be measured and reported 
either this way, or as in the method described above, fitting the 
broken ends together. Either result is valid. 
14.4.4 Elongation at fracture is defined as the elongation 
measured just prior to the sudden decrease in force associated 
with fracture. For many ductile materials not exhibiting a 
sudden decrease in force, the elongation at fracture can be 
taken as the strain measured just prior to when the force falls 
below 10 % of the maximum force encountered during the test. 
14.4.4.1 Elongation at fracture shall include elastic and 
plastic elongation and may be determined with autographic or 
automated methods using extensometers verified over the 
strain range of interest. Use a class B2 or better extensometer 
for materials having less than 5 % elongation; a class C or 
better extensometer for materials having elongation greater 
than or equal to 5 % but less than 50 %; and a class D or better 
extensometer for materials having 50 % or greater elongation. 
In all cases, the extensometer gauge length shall be the nominal 
gauge length required for the specimen being tested. Due to the 
lack of precision in fitting fractured ends together, the elonga­
tion after fracture using the manual methods of the preceding 
paragraphs may differ from the elongation at fracture deter­
mined with extensometers. 
14.4.4.2 Percent elongation at fracture may be calculated 
directly from elongation at fracture data and be reported 
instead of percent elongation as calculated in 14.4.1. However, 
these two parameters are not interchangeable. Use of the 
elongation at fracture method generally provides more repeat­
able results. 
14.5 Reduction of Area-Fit the ends of the fractured 
specimen together and measure the mean diameter or the width 
and thickness at the smallest cross section to the same accuracy 
as the original dimensions. The difference between the area 
thus found and the area of the original cross section expressed 
594 
as a percentage of the original area is the reduction of area.

A This table gives the approximate interrelationships of hardness values and approximate tensile strength of steels. It is possible that steels of various compositions and 
processing histories will deviate in hardness-tensile strength relationship from the data presented in this table. The data in this table should not be used for austenitic 
stainless steels, but have been shown to be applicable for ferritic and martensitic stainless steels. The data in this table should not be used to establish a relationship 
between hardness values and tensile strength of hard drawn wire. Where more precise conversions are required, they should be developed specially for each steel 
composition, heat treatment, and part. Caution should be exercised if conversions from this table are used for the acceptance or rejection of product. The approximate 
interrelationships may affect acceptance or rejection. 
17.2.2 Measuring Microscope-The divisions of the mi­
crometer scale of· the microscope or other measuring devices 
used for the measurement of the diameter of the indentations 
shall be such as to permit the direct measurement of the 
diameter to 0.1 mm and the estimation of the diameter to 
0.05mm. 
NOTE 14-This requirement applies to the construction of the micro­
scope only and is not a requirement for measurement of the indentation, 
see 17.4.3. 
596 
17 .2.3 Standard Ball-The standard tungsten carbide ball 
for Brinell hardness testing is 10 mm (0.3937 in.) in diameter 
with a deviation from this value of not more than 0.005 mm 
(0.0002 in.) in any diameter. A tungsten carbide ball suitable 
for use must not show a permanent change in diameter greater 
than 0.01 mm (0.0004 in.) when pressed with a force of 
3000 kgf against the test specimen. Steel ball indentors are no 
longer permitted for use in Brinell hardness testing in accor­
dance with these test methods.

17.3 Test Specimen-Brinell hardness tests are made on 
prepared areas and sufficient metal must be removed from the 
surface to eliminate decarburized metal and other surface 
irregularities. The thickness of the piece tested must be such 
that no bulge or other marking showing the effect of the load 
appears on the side of the piece opposite the indentation. 
17.4 Procedure: 
17.4.1 It is essential that the applicable product specifica­
tions state clearly the position at which Brinell hardness 
indentations are to be made and the number of such indenta­
tions required. The distance of the center of the indentation 
from the edge of the specimen or edge of another indentation 
must be at least two and one-half times the diameter of the 
indentation.

17.4.4.1 If a ball is used in a test of a specimen which shows 
a Brinell hardness number greater than the limit for the ball as 
detailed in 17.4.4, the ball shall be either discarded and 
replaced with a new ball or remeasured to ensure conformance 
with the requirements of Test Method ElO.

be supplemented by an index indicating the test conditions in 
the following order: 
17.5 .1.1 Diameter of the ball, mm, 
17.5.1.2 A value representing the applied load, kgf, and, 
17.5.1.3 The applied force dwell time, s, if other than 10 to 
15 s. 
17 .5 .1.4 The only exception to the above requirement is for 
the HBW 10/3000 scale when a 10 to 15 s dwell time is used. 
Only in the case of this one Brinell hardness scale may the 
designation be reported simply as HBW. 
17.5.1.5 Examples: 220 HBW = Brinell hardness of 220 
determined with a ball of 10 mm diameter and with a test force 
of 3000 kgf applied for 10 to 15 s; 350 HBW 5/1500 = Brinell 
hardness of 350 determined with a ball of 5 mm diameter and 
with a test force of 1500 kgf applied for 10 to 15 s. 
17.6 Detailed Procedure-For detailed requirements of this 
test, reference shall be made to the latest revision of Test 
Method El0. 
18. Rockwell Test 
18.1 Description: 
18.1.1 In this test a hardness value is obtained by determin­
ing the depth of penetration of a diamond point or a tungsten 
carbide ball into the specimen under certain arbitrarily fixed 
conditions. A minor load of 10 kgf is first applied which causes 
an initial penetration, sets the penetrator on the material and 
holds it in position. A major load which depends on the scale 
being used is applied increasing the depth of indentation. The 
major load is removed and, with the minor load still acting, the 
Rockwell number, which is proportional to the difference in 
penetration between the major and minor loads is determined; 
this is usually done by the machine and shows on a dial, digital

18 .1.2 Rockwell superficial hardness machines are used for 
the testing of very thin steel or thin surface layers. Loads of 15, 
30, or 45 kgf are applied on a tungsten carbide ( or a hardened 
steel) ball or diamond penetrator, to cover the same range of 
hardness values as for the heavier loads. Use of a hardened 
steel ball is permitted only for testing thin sheet tin mill 
products as found in Specifications A623 and A623M using 
HR15T and HR30T scales with a diamond spot anvil. (Testing 
of this product using a tungsten carbide indenter may give 
significantly different results as compared to historical test data 
obtained using a hardened steel ball.) The superficial hardness 
scales are as follows: 
Scale Maior Minor 
Symbol Penetrator Load, kgf Load, kg! 
15T 1/1B·in. tungsten carbide or steel ball 15 3 
30T 1/1a-in. tungsten carbide or steel ball 30 3 
45T 1/1s-in. tungsten carbide ball 45 3 
15N Diamond brale 15 3 
30N Diamond brale 30 3 
45N Diamond brale 45 3 
18.2 Reporting Hardness-In recording hardness values, the 
hardness number shall always precede the scale symbol, for 
example: 96 HRBW, 40 HRC, 75 HR15N, 56 HR30TS, or 77 
HR30TW. The suffix W indicates use of a tungsten carbide ball. 
The suffix S indicates use of a hardened steel ball as permitted 
in 18.1.2.

18.3 Test Blocks-Machines should be checked to make 
certain they are in good order by means of standardized 
Rockwell test blocks. 
18 .4 Detailed Procedure-For detailed requirements of this 
test, reference shall be made to the latest revision of Test 
Methods E18. 
19. Portable Hardness Test 
19.1 Although this standard generally prefers the use of 
fixed-location Brinell or Rockwell hardness test methods, it is 
not always possible to perform the hardness test using such 
equipment due to the part size, location, or other logistical 
reasons. In this event, hardness testing using portable equip­
ment as desc1ibed in Test Methods A956/A956M, A1038, and 
Ell0 shall be used with strict compliance for rep01ting the test 
results in accordance with the selected standard (see examples 
below). 
19.1.1 Practice A833-The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
given the HBC designation followed by the comparative test 
bar hardness to indicate that it was determined by a portable 
comparative hardness tester, as in the following example: 
19.1.1.1 232 HBC/240, where 232 is the hardness test result 
using the portable comparative test method (HBC) and 240 is 
the Brinell hardness of the comparative test bar. 
19.1.2 Test Method A956/A956M: 
19 .1.2.1 The measured hardness number shall be reported in 
accordance with the standard methods and appended with a 
Leeb impact device in parenthesis to indicate that it was 
determined by a portable hardness tester, as in the following 
example: 
( 1) 350 HLD where 350 is the hardness test result using the 
p01table Leeb hardness test method with the HLD impact 
device. 
19.1.2.2 When hardness values converted from the Leeb 
number are reported, the portable instrument used shall be 
reported in parentheses, for example: 
(1) 350 HB (HLD) where the original hardness test was 
performed using the portable Leeb hardness test method with 
the HLD impact device and converted to the Brinell hardness 
value (HB). 
19 .1.3 Test Method Al 038-The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
appended with UCI in parenthesis to indicate that it was 
determined by a portable hardness tester, as in the following 
example: 
19.l.3.l 446 HV (UC!) 10 where 446 is the hardness test 
result using the portable UCI test method under a force of 
10 kgf. 
19.1.4 Test Method Ell0-The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
appended with a IP to indicate that it was determined by a 
portable hardness tester, as follows: 
19.1.4.1 Rockwell Hardness Examples: 
( 1) 40 HRCIP where 40 is the hardness test result using the 
Rockwell C portable test method. 
602 
(2) 72 HRBWIP where 72 is the hardness test result using 
the Rockwell B portable test method using a tungsten carbide 
ball indenter. 
19.1.4.2 Brinell Hardness Examples: 
( 1) 220 HBWIP 10/3000 where 220 is the hardness test 
result using the Brinell portable test method with a ball of 
10 mm diameter and with a test force of 3000 kgf (29.42 kN) 
applied for 10 to 15 s. 
(2) 350 HBW/P 5/750 where 350 is the hardness test result 
using the Brinell portable test method with a ball of 5 mm 
diameter and with a test force of 750 kgf (7.355 kN) applied for 
10 to 15 s. 
CHARPY IMPACT TESTING 
20. Summary 
20.1 A Charpy V-notch impact test is a dynamic test in 
which a notched specimen is struck and broken by a single 
blow in a specially designed testing machine. The measured 
test values may be the energy absorbed, the percentage shear 
fracture, the lateral expansion opposite the notch, or a combi­
nation thereof. 
20.2 Testing temperatures other than room (ambient) tem­
perature often are specified in product or general requirement 
specifications (hereinafter referred to as the specification). 
Although the testing temperature is sometimes related to the 
expected service temperature, the two temperatures need not be 
identical. 
21. Significance and Use 
21.1 Ductile Versus Brittle Behavior-Body-centered-cubic 
or ferritic alloys exhibit a significant transition in behavior 
when impact tested over a range of temperatures. At tempera­
tures above transition, impact specimens fracture by a ductile 
(usually microvoid coalescence) mechanism, absorbing rela­
tively large amounts of energy. At lower temperatures, they 
fracture in a brittle (usually cleavage) manner absorbing 
appreciably less energy. Within the transition range, the frac­
ture will generally be a mixture of areas of ductile fracture and 
brittle fracture. 
21.2 The temperature range of tlle transition from one type 
of behavior to the other varies according to the material being 
tested. This transition behavior may be defined in various ways 
for specification purposes. 
21.2.1 The specification may require a minimum test result 
for absorbed energy, fracture appearance, lateral expansion, or 
a combination thereof, at a specified test temperature. 
21.2.2 The specification may require the determination of 
the transition temperature at which eitller the absorbed energy 
or fracture appearance attains a specified level when testing is 
performed over a range of temperatures. Alternatively the 
specification may require the detennination of tlle fracture 
appearance transition temperature (FATTn) as the temperature 
at which the required minimum percentage of shear fracture (n) 
is obtained. 
21.3 Further information on the significance of impact 
testing appears in Annex AS.

22. Apparatus 
22.1 Testing Machines: 
22.1.1 A Charpy impact machine is one in which a notched 
specimen is broken by a single blow of a freely swinging 
pendulum. The pendulum is released from a fixed height. Since 
the height to which the pendulum is raised prior to its swing, 
and the mass of the pendulum are known, the energy of the 
blow is predetermined. A means is provided to indicate the 
energy absorbed in breaking the specimen. 
22.1.2 The other principal feature of the machine is a fixture 
(see Fig. 10) designed to support a test specimen as a simple 
beam at a precise location. The fixture is arranged so that the 
notched face of the specimen is vertical. The pendulum strikes 
the other vertical face directly opposite the notch. The dimen­
sions of the specimen supports and striking edge shall conform 
to Fig. 10. 
22.1.3 Charpy machines used for testing steel generally 
have capacities in the 220 to 300 ft-lbf (300 to 400 J) energy 
range. Sometimes machines of lesser capacity are used; 
however, the capacity of the machine should be substantially in 
excess of the absorbed energy of the specimens (see Test 
Methods E23). The linear velocity at the point of impact should 
be in the range of 16 to 19 ft/s (4.9 to 5.8 m/s). 
Norn 15-An investigation of striker radius effect is available. 
22.2 Temperature Media: 
22.2.1 For testing at other than room temperature, it is 
necessary to condition the Charpy specimens in media at 
controlled temperatures. 
22.2.2 Low temperature media usually are chilled fluids 
(such as water, ice plus water, dry ice plus organic solvents, or 
liquid nitrogen) or chilled gases. 
22.2.3 Elevated temperat11re media are usually heated liq­
uids such as mineral or silicone oils. Circulating air ovens may 
be used. 
22.3 Handling Equipment-Tongs, especially adapted to fit 
the notch in the impact specimen, normally are used for 
removing the specimens from the medium and placing them on 
the anvil (refer to Test Methods E23). In cases where the 
machine fixture does not provide for automatic centering of the 
test specimen, the tongs may be precision machined to provide 
centering. 
23. Sampling and Number of Specimens 
23.1 Sampling: 
23.1.1 Test location and orientation should be addressed by 
the specifications. If not, for wrought products, the test location 
shall be the same as that for the tensile specimen and the 
orientation shall be longitudinal with the notch perpendicular 
to the major surface of the product being tested. 
23.l.2 Number of Specimens. 
23.1.2.1 All specimens used for a Charpy impact test shall 
be taken from a single test coupon or test location. 
23.1.2.2 When the specification calls for a minimum aver­
age test result, three specimens shall be tested.

FIG. 1 O Charpy (Simple-beam) Impact Test 
23.1.2.3 When the specification requires determination of a 
transition temperature, eight to twelve specimens are usually 
needed. 
23.2 Type and Size: 
23.2.1 Use a standard full size Charpy V-notch specimen as 
shown in Fig. 11, except as allowed in 23.2.2. 
603 
23.2.2 Subsized Specimens. 
23.2.2.1 For flat material less than 7/i6 in. (11 mm) thick, or 
when the absorbed energy is expected to exceed 80 % of full 
scale, use standard subsize test specimens. 
23.2.2.2 For tubular materials tested in the transverse 
direction, where the relationship between diameter and wall 
thickness does not permit a standard full size specimen, use 
standard subsize test specimens or standard size specimens 
containing outer diameter (OD) curvature as follows: 
( 1) Standard size specimens and subsize specimens may 
contain the original OD surface of the tubular product as shown 
in Fig. 12. All other dimensions shall comply with the 
requirements of Fig. 11. 
NoTE 16-For materials with toughness levels in excess of about 
50 ft-lbs, specimens containing the otiginal OD surface may yield values 
in excess of those resulting from the use of conventional Charpy 
specimens. 
23.2.2.3 If a standard full-size specimen cannot be prepared, 
the largest feasible standard subsize specimen shall be pre­
pared. The specimens shall be machined so that the specimen 
does not include material nearer to the surface than 0.020 in. 
(0.5 mm).

(b) Standard Subsize Specimens 
FIG. 11 Charpy (Simple Beam) Impact Test Specimens 
23.2.2.4 Tolerances for standard subsize specimens are 
shown in Fig. 11. Standard subsize test specimen sizes are: 
10 x 7.5 mm, 10 x 6.7 mm, 10 x 5 mm, 10 x 3.3 mm, and 
10 x2.5 mm. 
23.2.2.5 Notch the narrow face of the standard subsize 
specimens so that the notch is perpendicular to the 10 mm wide 
face. 
23.3 Notch Preparation-The machining (for example, 
milling, broaching, or grinding) of the notch is critical, as 
minor deviations in both notch radius and profile, or tool marks 
at the bottom of the notch may result in variations in test data, 
particularly in materials with low-impact energy absorption. 
(see Annex AS). 
24. Calibration 
24.1 Accuracy and Sensitivity-Calibrate and adjust Charpy 
impact machines in accordance with the requirements of Test 
Methods E23. 
25. Conditioning-Temperature Control 
25.1 When a specific test temperature is required by the 
specification or purchaser, control the temperature of the 
heating or cooling medium within ±2 °F (1 °C). 
Norn 17-For some steels there may not be a need for this restticted 
temperature, for example, austenitic steels. 
Norn 18-Because the temperature of a testing laboratory often varies 
from 60 to 90 °F (15 to 32 °C) a test conducted at "room temperature" 
might be conducted at any temperature in this range . 
26. Procedure 
26.l Temperature: 
26.1.1 Condition the specimens to be broken by holding 
them in the medium at test temperature for at least 5 min in 
liquid media and 30 min in gaseous media. 
26.1.2 Prior to each test, maintain the tongs for handling test 
specimens at the same temperature as the specimen so as not to 
affect the temperature at the notch. 
26.2 Positioning and Breaking Specimens: 
26.2.1 Carefully center the test specimen in the anvil and 
release the pendulum to break the specimen. 
26.2.2 If the pendulum is not released within 5 s after 
removing the specimen from the conditioning medium, do not 
break the specimen. Return the specimen to the conditioning 
medium for the period required in 26.1.1. 
26.3 Recovering Specimens-In the event that fracture ap­
pearance or lateral expansion must be determined, recover the 
matched pieces of each broken specimen before breaking the 
next specimen. 
26.4 Individual Test Values: 
26.4.1 Impact Energy-Record the impact energy absorbed 
to the nearest ft· lbf (J). 
604 
26.4.2 Fracture Appearance: 
26.4.2.1 Determine the percentage of shear fracture area by 
any of the following methods: 
(I) Measure the length and width of the brittle portion of 
the fracture surface, as shown in Fig. 13 and determine the 
percent shear area from either Table 7 or Table 8 depending on 
the units of measurement. 
(2) Compare the appearance of the fracture of the specimen 
with a fracture appearance chart as shown in Fig. 14. 
(3) Magnify the fracture surface and compare it to a 
precalibrated overlay chart or measure the percent shear 
fracture area by means of a planimeter. 
(4) Photograph the fractured surface at a suitable magnifi­
cation and measure the percent shear fracture area by means of 
a planimeter. 
26.4.2.2 Determine the individual fracture appearance val­
ues to the nearest 5 % shear fracture and record the value. 
26.4.3 Lateral Expansion: 
26.4.3.1 Lateral expansion is the increase in specimen 
width, measured in thousandths of an inch (mils), on the 
compression side, opposite the notch of the fractured Charpy 
V-notch specimen as shown in Fig. 15. 
26.4.3.2 Examine each specimen half to ascertain that the 
protrusions have not been damaged by contacting the anvil, 
machine mounting smface, and so forth. Discard such samples 
since they may cause erroneous readings. 
26.4.3.3 Check the sides of the specimens perpendicular to 
the notch to ensure that no burrs were formed on the sides 
during impact testing. If burrs exist, remove them carefully by 
rubbing on emery cloth or similar abrasive surface, making 
sure that the protrusions being measured are not rubbed during 
the removal of the burr.

each half relative to the plane defined by the undeformed 
portion of the side of the specimen using a gauge similar to that 
shown in Figs. 16 and 17. 
26.4.3.5 Since the fracture path seldom bisects the point of 
maximum expansion on both sides of a specimen, the sum of 
the larger values measured for each side is the value of the test. 
Affange the halves of one specimen so that compression sides 
are facing each other. Using the gauge, measure the protrusion 
on each half specimen, ensuring that the same side of the 
specimen is measured. Measure the two broken halves indi­

the nearest mil (0.025 mm) and record the values. 
26.4.3.7 With the exception described as follows, any speci­
men that does not separate into two pieces when struck by a

the unbroken specimen (prior to bending) is equal to or greater 
than that measured for the separated halves. In the case where 
a specimen cannot be separated into two halves, the lateral 
expansion can be measured as long as the shear lips can be 
accessed without interference from the hinged ligament that 
has been deformed during testing. 
27. Interpretation of Test Result 
27.1 When the acceptance criterion of any impact test is 
specified to be a minimum average value at a given 
temperature, the test result shall be the average (arithmetic 
mean rounded to the nearest ft-lbf (J)) of the individual test 
values of three specimens from one test location. 
27.1.1 When a minimum average test result is specified: 
27 .1.1.1 The test result is acceptable when all of the below 
are met: 
606 
( 1) The test result equals or exceeds the specified minimum 
average (given in the specification), 
(2) The individual test value for not more than one speci­
men measures less than the specified minimum average, and 
( 3) The individual test value for any specimen measures 
not less than two-thirds of the specified minimum average. 
27.1.1.2 If the acceptance requirements of 27.1.1.1 are not 
met, perform one retest of three additional specimens from the 
same test location. Each individual test value of the retested 
specimens shall be equal to or greater than the specified 
minimum average value.

27.2.l Determination of Transition Temperature: 
27 .2.1.1 Break one specimen at each of a series of tempera­
tures above and below the anticipated transition temperature

temperature at which the plotted curve intersects the specified 
test value by graphical interpolation ( extrapolation is not 
permitted). Record this transition temperature to the nearest 
5 °F (3 °C). If the tabulated test results clearly indicate a 
transition temperature lower than specified, it is not necessary 
to plot the data. Report the lowest test temperature for which 
test value exceeds the specified value. 
27.2.1.4 Accept the test result if the determined transition 
temperature is equal to or lower than the specified value. 
27.2.1.5 If the determined transition temperature is higher 
than the specified value, but not more than 20 °F (12 °C) higher 
than the specified value, test sufficient samples in accordance 
with Section 26 to plot two additional curves. Accept the test 
results if the temperatures determined from both additional 
tests are equal to or lower than the specified value. 
27.3 When subsize specimens are permitted or necessary, or 
both, modify the specified test requirement according to Table 
9 or test temperature according to ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code, Table UG-84.2, or both. Greater energies or lower 
test temperatures may be agreed upon by purchaser and 
supplier.

4 Care must be taken when using Table 9 for the conversion of subsize specimen absorbed energy results to those values that may be expected from full size Charpy
specimens. The use of conversion values should only be applied when both specimens types (full-size and sub-size) are in the same fracture regime (in other words. a
lower shelf, transition, or upper shelf) at the test temperature for the material under investigation. In particular test specimens <5 mm can exhibit variable absorbed energy
values (NIST Technical Note 1858). (1)

Al.2 Orientation of Test Specimens Al.3.2 Alloy Steel Bars-Alloy steel bars are usually not 
tested in the as-rolled condition. Al.2.1 Carbon and alloy steel bars and bar-size shapes, due 
to their relatively small cross-sectional dimensions, are cus­
tomaiily tested in the longitudinal direction. In special cases 
where size permits and the fab1ication or service of a part 
justifies testing in a transverse direction, the selection and 
location of test or tests are a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser.

A2. STEEL TUBULAR PRODUCTS 
A2.1 Scope 
A2.l.1 This annex contains testing requirements for Steel 
Tubular Products that are specific to the product. The require­
ments contained in this annex are supplementary to those found 
in the general section of this specification. In the case of 
conflict between requirements provided in this annex and those 
found in the general section of this specification, the require­
ments of this annex shall prevail. In the case of conflict 
between requirements provided in this annex and requirements 
found in product specifications, the requirements found in the 
product specification shall prevail. 
A2.1.2 Tubular shapes covered by this specification include, 
round, square, rectangular, and special shapes. 
A2.2 Tension Test 
A2.2.1 Full-size Longitudinal Test Specimens: 
A2.2.1.1 As an alternative to the use of longitudinal strip 
test specimens or longitudinal round test specimens, tension 
test specimens of full-size tubular sections are used, provided 
that the testing equipment has sufficient capacity. Snug-fitting 
metal plugs should be inserted far enough in the end of such 
tubular specimens to permit the testing machine jaws to grip 
the specimens properly without crushing. A design that may be 
used for such plugs is shown in Fig. A2.1. The plugs shall not 
extend into that part of the specimen on which the elongation 
is measured (see Fig. A2.l). Care should be exercised to see 
that insofar as practicable, the load in such cases is applied 
axially. The length of the full-section specimen depends on the 
gauge length prescribed for measuring the elongation. 
A2.2.1.2 Unless otherwise required by the product 
specification, the gauge length is 2 in. or 50 mm, except that for 
tubing having an outside diameter of 3/s in. (9.5 mm) or less, it 
is customary for a gauge length equal to four times the outside

diameter to be used when elongation comparable to that 
obtainable with larger test specimens is required. 
A2.2.1.3 To determine the cross-sectional area of the full­
section specimen, measurements shall be recorded as the 
average or mean between the greatest and least measurements 
of the outside diameter and the average or mean wall thickness, 
to the nearest 0.001 in. (0.025 mm) and the cross-sectional area 
is determined by the following equation: 
A= 3.1416t (D t) (A2. l) 
where: 
A = sectional area, in.2 
D = outside diameter, in., and 
t = thickness of tube wall, in. 
Norn A2.1-There exist other methods of cross-sectional area 
determination, such as by weighing of the specimens, which are equally

SA-370 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
accurate or appropriate for the purpose. 
A2.2.2 Longitudinal Strip Test Specimens: 
A2.2.2.1 As an alternative to the use of full-size longitudi­
nal test specimens or longitudinal round test specimens, 
longitudinal strip test specimens, obtained from strips cut from 
the tubular product as shown in Fig. A2.2 and machined to the 
dimensions shown in Fig. A2.3 are used. For welded structural 
tubing, such test specimens shall be from a location at least 90° 
from the weld; for other welded tubular products, such test 
specimens shall be from a location approximately 90° from the 
weld. Unless otherwise required by the product specification, 
the gauge length shall conform to dimension C in Fig. A2.3. 
The test specimens shall be tested using grips that are flat or 
have a surface contour corresponding to the curvature of the 
tubular product, or the ends of the test specimens shall be 
flattened without heating prior to the test specimens being 
tested using flat grips. The test specimen shown as specimen 4 
in Fig. 3 shall be used, unless the capacity of the testing 
equipment or the dimensions and nature of the tubular product 
to be tested makes the use of specimen nos. 1, 2, or 3 necessary. 
Norn A2.2-An exact formula for calculating the cross-sectional area 
of specimens of the type shown in Fig. A2.3 taken from a circular tube is 
given in Test Methods ES/ESM. 
A2.2.2.2 The width should be measured at each end of the 
gauge length to determine parallelism and also at the center. 
The thickness should be measured at the center and used with 
the center measurement of the width to determine the cross­
sectional area. The center width dimension should be recorded 
to the nearest 0.005 in. (0.127 mm), and the thickness 
measurement to the nearest 0.001 in. 
A2.2.3 Transverse Strip Test Specimens: 
A2.2.3.1 In general, transverse tension tests are not recom­
mended for tubular products, in sizes smaller than 8 in. in 
nominal diameter. When required, transverse tension test 
specimens may be taken from rings cut from ends of tubes or 
pipe as shown in Fig. A2.4. Flattening of the specimen may be 
done either after separating it from the tube as in Fig. A2.4 (a), 
or before separating it as in Fig. A2.4 (b), and may be done hot 
or cold; but if the flattening is done cold, the specimen may 
subsequently be normalized. Specimens from tubes or pipe for 
which heat treatment is specified, after being flattened either 
hot or cold, shall be given the same treatment as the tubes or 
Norn 1-The edges of the blank for the specimen shall be cut parallel 
to each other. 
FIG. A2.2 Location of Longitudinal Tension-Test Specimens in 
Rings Cut From Tubular Products 
pipe. For tubes or pipe having a wall thickness of less than ¾ 
in. (19 mm), the transverse test specimen shall be of the form 
and dimensions shown in Fig. A2.5 and either or both smfaces 
may be machined to secure uniform thickness. Specimens for 
transverse tension tests on welded steel tubes or pipe to 
determine strength of welds, shall be located perpendicular to 
the welded seams with the weld at about the middle of their 
length. 
A2.2.3.2 The width should be measured at each end of the 
gauge length to determine parallelism and also at the center. 
The thickness should be measured at the center and used with 
the center measurement of the width to determine the cross­
sectional area. The center width dimension should be recorded 
to the nearest 0.005 in. (0.127 mm), and the thickness 
measurement to the nearest 0.001 in. (0.025 mm). 
A2.2.4 Round Test Specimens: 
A2.2.4.1 When provided for in the product specification, the 
round test specimen shown in Fig. 4 may be used. 
A2.2.4.2 The diameter of the round test specimen is mea­
sured at the center of the specimen to the nearest 0.001 in. 
(0.025 mm). 
A2.2.4.3 Small-size specimens proportional to standard, as 
shown in Fig. 4, may be used when it is necessary to test 
material from which the standard specimen cannot be prepared. 
Other sizes of small-size specimens may be used. In any such 
small-size specimen, it is important that the gauge length for 
measurement of elongation be four times the diameter of the 
specimen (see Note 5, Fig. 4). The elongation requirements for 
the round specimen 2-in. gauge length in the product specifi­
cation shall apply to the small-size specimens. 
A2.2.4.4 For transverse specimens, the section from which 
the specimen is taken shall not be flattened or otherwise 
deformed. 
612 
A2.2.4.5 Longitudinal test specimens are obtained from 
strips cut from the tubular product as shown in Fig. A2.2. 
A2.3 Determination of Transverse Yield Strength, Hydrau­
lic Ring-expansion Method 
A2.3.l Hardness tests are made on the outside surface, 
inside surface, or wall cross-section depending upon product­
specification limitation. Surface preparation may be necessary 
to obtain accurate hardness values. 
A2.3.2 A testing machine and method for determining the 
transverse yield strength from an annular ring specimen, have 
been developed and described in A2.3.3 - 9.1.2. 
A2.3.3 A diagrammatic vertical cross-sectional sketch of 
the testing machine is shown in Fig. A2.6. 
A2.3.4 In determining the transverse yield strength on this 
machine, a sh01t ring (commonly 3 in. (76 mm) in length) test 
specimen is used. After the large circular nut is removed from 
the machine, the wall thickness of the ring specimen is 
determined and the specimen is telescoped over the oil resistant 
rubber gasket. The nut is then replaced, but is not turned down 
tight against the specimen. A slight clearance is left between 
the nut and specimen for the purpose of permitting free radial 
movement of the specimen as it is being tested. Oil under 
pressure is then admitted to the interior of the rubber gasket

through the pressure line under the control of a suitable valve. 
An accurately calibrated pressure gauge serves to measure oil 
pressure. Any air in the system is removed through the bleeder 
line. As the oil pressure is increased, the rubber gasket expands 
which in turn stresses the specimen circumferentially. As the 
pressure builds up, the lips of the rubber gasket act as a seal to 
prevent oil leakage. With continued increase in pressure, the 
ring specimen is subjected to a tension stress and elongates 
accordingly. The entire outside circumference of the ring 
specimen is considered as the gauge length and the strain is 
measured with a suitable extensometer which will be described 
later. When the desired total strain or extension under load is 
reached on the extensometer, the oil pressure in pounds per 
square inch is read and by employing Barlow's formula, the 
unit yield strength is calculated. The yield strength, thus 
determined, is a true result since the test specimen has not been

A2.4 Hardness Tests 
A2.4.1 Hardness tests are made either on the outside or the 
inside surfaces on the end of the tube as appropriate. 
A2.4.2 The standard 3000 kgf Brinell load may cause too 
much deformation in a thin-walled tubular specimen. In this 
case the 500 kgf load shall be applied, or inside stiffening by 
means of an internal anvil should be used. Brinell testing shall 
not be applicable to tubular products less than 2 in. (51 mm) in 
outside diameter, or less than 0.200 in. (5.1 mm) in wall 
thickness. 
A2.4.3 The Rockwell hardness tests are normally made on 
the inside surface, a flat on the outside smface, or on the wall 
cross-section depending upon the product limitation. Rockwell 
hardness tests are not performed on tubes smaller than 5 /16 in. 
(7.9 mm) in outside diameter, nor are they performed on the 
inside surface of tubes with less than ¼ in. (6.4 mm) inside 
diameter. Rockwell hardness tests are not performed on an­
nealed tubes with walls less than 0.065 in. (1.65 mm) thick or 
cold worked or heat treated tubes with walls less than 0.049 in. 
(1.24 mm) thick. For tubes with wall thicknesses less than 
those permitting the regular Rockwell hardness test, the Su­
perficial Rockwell test is sometimes substituted. Transverse 
Rockwell hardness readings can be made on tubes with a wall 
thickness of 0.187 in. (4.75 mm) or greater. The curvature and 
the wall thickness of the specimen impose limitations on the

Rockwell hardness test. When a comparison is made between 
Rockwell determinations made on the outside surface and 
determinations made on the inside surface, adjustment of the 
readings will be required to compensate for the effect of 
curvature. The Rockwell B scale is used on all materials having 
an expected hardness range of BO to B 100. The Rockwell C 
scale is used on material having an expected hardness range of 
C20 to C68. 
A2.4.4 Superficial Rockwell hardness tests are normally 
performed on the outside surface whenever possible and 
whenever excessive sp1ing back is not encountered. Otherwise, 
the tests may be perfonned on the inside. Superficial Rockwell 
hardness tests shall not be performed on tubes with an inside 
diameter of less than ¼ in. (6.4 mm). The wall thickness 
limitations for the Superficial Rockwell hardness test are given 
in Tables A2.1 and A2.2. 
A2.4.5 When the outside diameter, inside diameter, or wall 
thickness precludes the obtaining of accurate hardness values, 
tubular products shall be specified to tensile properties and so 
tested. 
A2.5 Manipulating Tests 
A2.5.1 The following tests are made to prove ductility of 
certain tubular products: 
A2.5.l.1 Flattening Test-The flattening test as commonly 
made on specimens cut from tubular products is conducted by 
subjecting rings from the tube or pipe to a presc1ibed degree of 
flattening between parallel plates (see Fig. A2.4). The severity 
of the flattening test is measured by the distance between the 
parallel plates and is varied according to the dimensions of the 
tube or pipe. The flattening test specimen should not be less 
than 2½ in. (63.5 mm) in length and should be flattened cold to 
the extent required by the applicable material specifications. 
A2.5 .1.2 Reverse Flattening Test-The reverse flattening 
test is designed primarily for application to electric-welded 
tubing for the detection of lack of penetration or overlaps 
resulting from flash removal in the weld. The specimen 
consists of a length of tubing approximately 4 in. (102 mm) 
long which is split longitudinally 90° on each side of the weld. 
The sample is then opened and flattened with the weld at the 
point of maximum bend (see Fig. A2.9).

A2.5.l.3 Crush Test-The crush test, sometimes referred to 
as an upsetting test, is usually made on boiler and other 
pressure tubes, for evaluating ductility (see Fig. A2.10). The 
specimen is a ring cut from the tube, usually about 2½ in. 
(63.5 mm) long. It is placed on end and crushed endwise by 
hammer or press to the distance prescribed by the applicable 
material specifications. 
A2.5 .1.4 Flange Test-The flange test is intended to deter­
mine the ductility of boiler tubes and their ability to withstand 
the operation of bending into a tube sheet. The test is made on 
FIG. A2.1 O Crush Test Specimen 
616

=== Page 669 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-370 
a ring cut from a tube, usually not less than 4 in. (100 mm) long 
and consists of having a flange turned over at right angles to the 
body of the tube to the width required by the applicable 
material specifications. The flaring tool and die block shown in 
Fig. A2.11 are recommended for use in making this test. 
A2.5. I.5 Flaring Test-For certain types of pressure tubes, 
an alternate to the flange test is made. This test consists of 
driving a tapered mandrel having a slope of 1 in 10 as shown 
in Fig. A2.12 (a) or a 60° included angle as shown in Fig. 
A2.12 (b) into a section cut from the tube, approximately 4 in. 
(100 mm) in length, and thus expanding the specimen until the 
inside diameter has been increased to the extent required by the 
applicable material specifications. 
A2.5.l.6 Bend Test-For pipe used for coiling in sizes 2 in. 
and under a bend test is made to determine its ductility and the 
soundness of weld. In this test a sufficient length of full-size 
pipe is bent cold through 90° around a cylindrical mandrel 
having a diameter 12 times the nominal diameter of the pipe. 
For close coiling, the pipe is bent cold through 180° around a 
mandrel having a diameter 8 times the nominal diameter of the 
pipe.

A2.5.l.7 Transverse Guided Bend Test of Welds-This bend 
test is used to determine the ductility of fusion welds. The 
specimens used are approximately 1 ½ in. (38 mm) wide, at 
least 6 in. (152 mm) in length with the weld at the center, and 
are machined in accordance with Fig. A2.13 for face and root 
bend tests and in accordance with Fig. A2. l 4 for side bend 
tests. The dimensions of the plunger shall be as shown in Fig. 
A2.15 and the other dimensions of the bending jig shall be 
substantially as given in this same figure. A test shall consist of 
a face bend specimen and a root bend specimen or two side 
bend specimens. A face bend test requires bending with the 
inside surface of the pipe against the plunger; a root bend test 
requires bending with the outside surface of the pipe against 
the plunger; and a side bend test requires bending so that one 
of the side smfaces becomes the convex surface of the bend 
specimen. 
( 1) Failure of the bend test depends upon the appearance of 
cracks in the area of the bend, of the nature and extent 
described in the product specifications.

A3. STEEL FASTENERS 
A3.1 Scope 
A3.l.1 This annex contains testing requirements for Steel 
Fasteners that are specific to the product. The requirements 
contained in this annex are supplementary to those found in the 
general section of this specification. In the case of conflict 
between requirements provided in this annex and those found 
in the general section of this specification, the requirements of 
this annex shall prevail. In the case of conflict between 
requirements provided in this annex and requirements found in 
product specifications, the requirements found in the product 
specification shall prevail. 
A3.l.2 These tests are set up to facilitate production control 
testing and acceptance testing with certain more precise tests to 
be used for arbitration in case of disagreement over test results. 
A3.2 Tension Tests 
A3.2.l It is preferred that bolts be tested full size, and it is 
customary, when so testing bolts to specify a minimum 
ultimate load in pounds, rather than a minimum ultimate 
strength in pounds per square inch. Three times the bolt 
nominal diameter has been established as the minimum bolt 
length subject to the tests described in the remainder of this 
section. Subsections A3.2.l.1 - A3.2.l.6 apply when testing 
bolts full size. Subsection A3.2.l.4 shall apply where the 
individual product specifications permit the use of machined 
specimens. 
A3.2.l.1 Proof Load-Due to particular uses of certain 
classes of bolts it is desirable to be able to stress them, while 
in use, to a specified value without obtaining any permanent 
set. To be certain of obtaining this quality the proof load is 
specified. The proof load test consists of stressing the bolt with 
a specified load which the bolt must withstand without perma­
nent set. An alternate test which determines yield strength of a 
full size bolt is also allowed. Either of the following Methods, 
1 or 2, may be used but Method 1 shall be the arbitration 
method in case of any dispute as to acceptance of the bolts. 
A3.2.l.2 Proof Load Testing Long Bolts-When fasteners 
are too long to test in the available equipment they may be cut 
to 8 ± 0.125 in. and tested using Method I. If there is a dispute 
over results when testing the same part or lot of parts both full 
size and cut to 8 in., the 8 in. test results shall be used to 
determine acceptance. 
619 
(a) Method 1, Length Measurement-The overall length of 
a straight bolt shall be measured at its true center line with an 
instrument capable of measuring changes in length of

=== Page 672 ===

SA-370 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
0.0001 in. (0.0025 mm) with an accuracy of 0.0001 in. in any 
0.001-in. (0.025 mm) range. The preferred method of measur­
ing the length shall be between conical centers machined on the 
center line of the bolt, with mating centers on the measuring 
anvils. The head or body of the bolt shall be marked so that it 
can be placed in the same position for all measurements. The 
bolt shall be assembled in the testing equipment as outlined in 
A3.2.1.4, and the proof load specified in the product specifi­
cation shall be applied. Upon release of this load the length of 
the bolt shall be again measured and shall show no permanent 
elongation. A tolerance of :t0.0005 in. (0.0127 mm) shall be 
allowed between the measurement made before loading and 
that made after loading. Variables, such as straightness and 
thread alignment (plus measurement e1rnr), may result in 
apparent elongation of the fasteners when the proof load is 
initially applied. In such cases, the fastener may be retested 
using a 3 % greater load, and may be considered satisfactory if 
the length after this loading is the same as before this loading 
(within the 0.0005-in. tolerance for measurement error). 
A3.2. l .3 Proof Load-Time of Loading-The proof load is to 
be maintained for a period of 10 s before release of load, when 
using Method 1. 
(1) Method 2, Yield Strength-The bolt shall be assembled 
in the testing equipment as outlined in A3.2.l.4. As the load is 
applied, tl1e total elongation of the bolt or any part of the bolt 
which includes the exposed six threads shall be measured and 
recorded to produce a load-strain or a stress-strain diagram. 
The load or stress at an offset equal to 0.2 % of the length of 
bolt occupied by six full threads shall be determined by the 
method described in 14.2.1 of these methods, A370. This load 
or stress shall not be less than that prescribed in the product 
specification. 
A3.2.l.4 Axial Tension Testing of Full Size Bolts-Bolts 
are to be tested in a holder with the load axially applied 
between the head and a nut or suitable fixture (see Fig. A3.l), 
either of which shall have sufficient thread engagement to 
FIG. A3.1 Tension Testing Full-size Bolt 
develop the full strength of the bolt. The nut or fixture shall be 
assembled on the bolt leaving six complete bolt threads 
unengaged between the grips, except for heavy hexagon 
structural bolts which shall have four complete threads unen­
gaged between the grips. To meet the requirements of this test, 
there shall be a tensile failure in the body or threaded section 
with no failure at the junction of the body and head. When 
tensile testing externally threaded fasteners made of austenitic 
stainless steel and the test fastener's thread pulls out of the 
internally threaded test fixture after the minimum tensile 
strength requirement has been reached, the fasteners shall be 
considered conforming to the tensile strength requirement and, 
in addition to the tensile strength, the failure mode shall be 
reported to the purchaser. If it is necessary to record or report 
the tensile strength of bolts as psi values, the stress area shall 
be calculated from the mean of the mean root and pitch 
diameters of Class 3 external threads as follows: 
A,= 0.7854 [D - (0.9743/n)] 2 (A3.l) 
where: 
As = stress area, in.2, 
D = nominal diameter, in., and 
n = number of threads per in. 
A3.2.l.5 Tension Testing of Full-size Bolts with a Wedge­
The purpose of this test is to obtain the tensile strength and 
demonstrate the "head quality" and ductility of a bolt with a 
standard head by subjecting it to eccentric loading. The 
ultimate load on the bolt shall be determined as described in 
A3.2.1.4, except that a 10° wedge shall be placed under the 
same bolt previously tested for the proof load (see A3.2.1.1). 
The bolt head shall be so placed that no comer of the hexagon 
or square takes a bearing load, that is, a flat of the head shall 
be aligned with the direction of uniform thickness of the wedge 
(see Fig. A3.2). The wedge shall have an included angle 
between its faces as shown in Table A3.1 and shall have a 
thickness of one-half of the nominal bolt diameter at the short 
side of the hole. The hole in the wedge shall have the following 
clearance over the nominal size of the bolt, and its edges, top 
and bottom, shall be rounded to the following radius: 
Clearance in Hole, Radius on Corners of 
Nominal Bolt Size, in. in. (mm) Hole, in. (mm)

A3.2.1.6 Wedge Testing of HT Bolts Threaded to Head-For 
heat-treated bolts that are threaded 1 diameter and closer to the 
underside of the head, the wedge angle shall be 6° for sizes ¼ 
through¾ in. (6.35 to 19.0 mm) and 4° for sizes over¾ in. 
A3.2.1.7 Tension Testing of Bolts Machined to Round Test 
Specimens: 
( 1) Bolts under l ½ in. (38 mm) in nominal diameter 
which require machined tests shall preferably use a standard 
½-in., (13 mm) round 2-in. (50 mm) gauge length test 
specimen (see Fig. 4); however, bolts of small cross-section 
that will not permit the taking of this standard test specimen 
shall use one of the small-size-specimens-proportional-to­
standard (see Fig. 4) and the specimen shall have a reduced 
section as large as possible. In all cases, the longitudinal axis of

the specimen shall be concentric with the axis of the bolt; the 
head and threaded section of the bolt may be left intact, as in 
Fig. A3.3 and Fig. A3.4, or shaped to fit the holders or grips of 
the testing machine so that the load is applied axially. The 
gauge length for measuring the elongation shall be four times 
the diameter of the specimen. 
621 
(2) For bolts 1½ in. and over in nominal diameter, a 
standard ½-in. round 2-in. gauge length test specimen shall be 
turned from the bolt, having its axis midway between the 
center and outside surface of the body of the bolt as shown in 
Fig. A3.5. 
( 3) Machined specimens are to be tested in tension to 
determine the properties prescribed by the product specifica­
tions. The methods of testing and determination of properties 
shall be in accordance with Section 14 of these test methods. 
A3.3 Hardness Tests for Externally Threaded Fasteners 
A3.3.1 When specified, externally threaded fasteners shall 
be hardness tested. Fasteners with hexagonal or square heads 
shall be Brinell or Rockwell hardness tested. For hexagonal 
and square head bolts, test shall be conducted on the wrench 
flats, top of head, unthreaded shank, end of bolt or at the 
arbitration location. For studs, products without parallel

A4. STEEL ROUND WIRE PRODUCTS 
A4.1 Scope 
A4.1. l This annex contains testing requirements for Round 
Wire Products that are specific to the product. The require­
ments contained in this annex are supplementary to those found 
in the general section of this specification. In the case of 
conflict between requirements provided in this annex and those 
found in the general section of this specification, the require­
ments of this annex shall prevail. In the case of conflict 
between requirements provided in this annex and requirements 
found in product specifications, the requirements found in the 
product specification shall prevail. 
A4.2 Apparatus 
A4.2.l Gripping Devices-Giips of either the wedge or 
snubbing types as shown in Figs. A4.1 and A4.2 shall be used 
(see Note A4.1). When using grips of either type, care shall be 
taken that the axis of the test specimen is located approxi­
mately at the center line of the head of the testing machine (see 
Note A4.2). When using wedge grips the liners used behind the 
grips shall be of the proper thickness. 
NoTE A4.l-Testing machines usually are equipped with wedge grips. 
These wedge grips, irrespective of the type of testing machine, may be 
refen-ed to as the "usual type" of wedge grips. The use of fine (180 or 240) 
grit abrasive cloth in the "usual" wedge type grips, with the abrasive 
contacting the wire specimen, cau be helpful in reducing specimen

FIG. A4.2 Snubbing-type Gripping Device 
slipping aud breakage at the grip edges at tensile loads up to about 
1000 lb. For tests of specimens of wire which are liable to be cut at the 
edges by the "usual type" of wedge grips, the snubbing type gripping 
device has proved satisfactory. 
For testing round wire, the use of cylindrical seat in the wedge gripping 
device is optional. 
NoTE A4.2-Any defect in a testing machine which may cause nonaxial 
application of load should be corrected. 
A4.2.2 Pointed Micrometer-A micrometer with a pointed 
spindle and anvil suitable for reading the dimensions of the 
wire specimen at the fractured ends to the nearest 0.001 in. 
(0.025 mm) after breaking the specimen in the testing machine 
shall be used. 
A4.3 Test Specimens 
A4.3.1 Test specimens having the full cross-sectional area 
of the wire they represent shall be used. The standard gauge 
length of the specimens shall be 10 in. (254 mm). However, if 
the determination of elongation values is not required, any 
convenient gauge length is permissible. The total length of the 
specimens shall be at least equal to the gauge length (10 in.) 
plus twice the length of wire required for the full use of the grip 
employed. For example, depending upon the type of testing 
machine and grips used, the minimum total length of specimen 
may vary from 14 to 24 in. (360 to 610 mm) for a 10-in. gauge 
length specimen. 
A4.3.2 Any specimen breaking in the grips shall be dis­
carded and a new specimen tested.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-370 
A4.4 Elongation 
A4.4.1 In determining permanent elongation, the ends of the 
fractured specimen shall be carefully fitted together and the 
distance between the gauge marks measured to the nearest 
0.01 in. (0.25 mm) with dividers and scale or other suitable 
device. The elongation is the increase in length of the gauge 
length, expressed as a percentage of the original gauge length. 
In recording elongation values, both the percentage increase 
and the original gauge length shall be given. 
A4.4.2 In determining total elongation (elastic plus plastic 
extension) autographic or extensometer methods may be em­
ployed. 
A4.4.3 If fracture takes place outside of the middle third of 
the gauge length, the elongation value obtained may not be 
representative of the material. 
A4.S Reduction of Area 
A4.5.1 The ends of the fractured specimen shall be carefully 
fitted together and the dimensions of the smallest cross section 
measured to the nearest 0.001 in. (0.025 mm) with a pointed 
micrometer. The difference between the area thus found and the 
area of the original cross section, expressed as a percentage of 
the original area, is the reduction of area. 
A4.5.2 The reduction of area test is not recommended in 
wire diameters less than 0.092 in. (2.34 mm) due to the 
difficulties of measuring the reduced cross sections. 
A4.6 Rockwell Hardness Test 
A4.6.1 On heat-treated wire of diameter 0.100 in. 
(2.54 mm) and larger, the specimen shall be flattened on two 
parallel sides by grinding before testing. The hardness test is 
not recommended for any diameter of hard drawn wire or 
heat-treated wire less than 0.100 in. (2.54 mm) in diameter. For 
round wire, the tensile strength test is greatly preferred over the 
hardness test. 
A4.7 Wrap Test 
A4. 7 .1 This test is used as a means for testing the ductility 
of certain kinds of wire. 
A4. 7 .2 The test consists of coiling the wire in a closely 
spaced helix tightly against a mandrel of a specified diameter 
for a required number of turns. (Unless other specified, the 
required number of turns shall be five.) The wrapping may be 
done by hand or a power device. The wrapping rate may not 
exceed 15 turns per min. The mandrel diameter shall be 
specified in the relevant wire product specification. 
A4.7.3 The wire tested shall be considered to have failed if 
the wire fractures or if any longitudinal or transverse cracks 
develop which can be seen by the unaided eye after the first 
complete tum. Wire which fails in the first tum shall be 
retested, as such fractures may be caused by bending the wire 
to a radius less than specified when the test starts. 
A4.8 Coiling Test 
A4.8.l This test is used to determine if imperfections are 
present to the extent that they may cause cracking or splitting 
during spring coiling and spring extension. A coil of specified 
length is closed wound on an arbor of a specified diameter. The 
closed coil is then stretched to a specified permanent increase 
in length and examined for uniformity of pitch with no splits or 
fractures. The required arbor diameter, closed coil length, and 
permanent coil extended length increase may vary with wire 
diameter, properties, and type. 
AS. NOTES ON SIGNIFICANCE OF NOTCHED-BAR IMPACT TESTING 
AS.I Notch Behavior 
A5.l.1 The Charpy and Izod type tests bring out notch 
behavior (brittleness versus ductility) by applying a single 
overload of stress. The energy values detennined are quantita­
tive comparisons on a selected specimen but cannot be 
converted into energy values that would serve for engineering 
design calculations. The notch behavior indicated in an indi­
vidual test applies only to the specimen size, notch geometry, 
and testing conditions involved and cannot be generalized to 
other sizes. of specimens and conditions. 
A5.l.2 The notch behavior of the face-centered cubic met­
als and alloys, a large group of nonfen-ous materials and the 
austenitic steels can be judged from their common tensile 
properties, If they are brittle in tension they will be brittle when 
notched, while if they are ductile in tension, they will be ductile 
when notched, except for unusually sharp or deep notches 
(much more severe than the standard Charpy or Izod speci­
mens). Even low temperatures do not alter this characteristic of 
625 
these materials. In contrast, the behavior of the ferritic steels 
under notch conditions cannot be predicted from their proper­
ties as revealed by the tension test. For the study of these 
materials the Charpy and Izod type tests are accordingly very 
useful. Some metals that display normal ductility in the tension 
test may nevertheless break in brittle fashion when tested or 
when used in the notched condition. Notched conditions 
include restraints to deformation in directions perpendicular to 
the major stress, or multiaxial stresses, and stress concentra­
tions. It is in this field that the Charpy and Izod tests prove 
useful for determining the susceptibility of a steel to notch­
brittle behavior though they cannot be directly used to appraise 
the serviceability of a structure. 
A5.1.3 The testing machine itself must be sufficiently rigid 
or tests on high-strength low-energy materials will result in 
excessive elastic energy losses either upward through the . 
pendulum shaft or downward through the base of the machine. 
If the anvil supports, the pendulum striking edge, or the

=== Page 676 ===

SA-370 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
machine foundation bolts are not securely fastened, tests on 
ductile materials in the range of 80 ft•lbf (108 J) may actually 
indicate values in excess of 90 to 100 ft•lbf (122 to 136 J). 
AS.2 Notch Effect 
A5.2.1 The notch results in a combination of multiaxial 
stresses associated with restraints to deformation in directions 
perpendicular to the major stress, and a stress concentration at 
the base of the notch. A severely notched condition is generally 
not desirable, and it becomes of real concern in those cases in 
which it initiates a sudden and complete failure of the brittle 
type. Some metals can be deformed in a ductile manner even 
down to the low temperatures of liquid air, while others may 
crack. This difference in behavior can be best understood by 
considering the cohesive strength of a material (or the property 
that holds it together) and its relation to the yield point. In cases 
of brittle fracture, the cohesive strength is exceeded before 
significant plastic defonnation occurs and the fracture appears 
crystalline. In cases of the ductile or shear type of failure, 
considerable deformation precedes the final fracture and the 
broken surface appears fibrous instead of crystalline. In inter­
mediate cases the fracture comes after a moderate amount of 
deformation and is part crystalline and part fibrous in appear­
ance. 
AS.2.2 When a notched bar is loaded, there is a normal 
stress across the base of the notch which tends to initiate 
fracture. The property that keeps it from cleaving, or holds it 
together, is the "cohesive strength." The bar fractures when the 
normal stress exceeds the cohesive strength. When this occurs 
without the bar deforming it is the condition for brittle fracture. 
A5.2.3 In testing, though not in service because of side 
effects, it happens more commonly that plastic deformation 
precedes fracture. In addition to the normal stress, the applied 
load also sets up shear stresses which are about 45° to the 
normal stress. The elastic behavior terminates as soon as the 
shear stress exceeds the shear strength of the material and 
deformation or plastic yielding sets in. This is the condition for 
ductile failure. 
A5.2.4 This behavior, whether brittle or ductile, depends on 
whether the normal stress exceeds the cohesive strength before 
the shear stress exceeds the shear strength. Several important 
facts of notch behavior follow from this. If the notch is made 
sharper or more drastic, the normal stress at the root of the 
notch will be increased in relation to the shear stress and the 
bar will be more prone to brittle fracture ( see Table AS .1 ). Also, 
as the speed of deformation increases, the shear strength 
increases and the likelihood of brittle fracture increases. On the 
other hand, by raising the temperature, leaving the notch and 
the speed of deformation the same, the shear strength is 
lowered and ductile behavior is promoted, leading to shear 
failure. 
A5.2.5 Variations in notch dimensions will seriously affect 
the results of the tests. Tests on B4340 s_teel specimens have 
shown the effect of dimensional variations on Charpy results 
(see Table A5.l). 
AS.3 Size Effect 
A5.3.l Increasing either the width or the depth of the 
specimen tends to increase the volume of metal subject to 
distortion, and by this factor tends to increase the energy 
absorption when breaking the specimen. However, any in­
crease in size, particularly in width, also tends to increase the 
degree of restraint and by tending to induce brittle fracture, 
may decrease the amount of energy absorbed. Where a 
standard-size specimen is on the verge of brittle fracture, this is 
particularly true, and a double-width specimen may actually 
require less energy for rupture than one of standard width. 
AS.3.2 In studies of such effects where the size of the 
material precludes the use of the standard specimen, as for 
example when the material is ¼-in. plate, subsize specimens 
are necessarily used. Such specimens (see Fig. 6 of Test 
Methods E23) are based on the Type A specimen of Fig. 4 of 
Test Methods E23. 
AS.3.3 General correlation between the energy values ob­
tained with specimens of different size or shape is not feasible, 
but limited correlations may be established for specification 
purposes on the basis of special studies of particular materials 
and particular specimens. On the other hand, in a study of the 
relative effect of process variations, evaluation by use of some 
arbitrarily selected specimen with some chosen notch will in 
most instances place the methods in their proper order. 
AS.4 Effects of Testing Conditions 
AS.4.1 The testing conditions also affect the notch behavior. 
So pronounced is the effect of temperature on the behavior of 
steel when notched that comparisons are frequently made by

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-370 
examining specimen fractures and by plotting energy value and 
fracture appearance versus temperature from tests of notched 
bars at a series of temperatures. When the test temperature has 
been carried low enough to start cleavage fracture, there may 
be an extremely sharp drop in impact value or there may be a 
relatively gradual falling off toward the lower temperatures. 
This drop in energy value starts when a specimen begins to 
exhibit some crystalline appearance in the fracture. The tran­
sition temperature at which this embrittling effect takes place 
vaiies considerably with the size of the part or test specimen 
and with the notch geometry. 
AS.4.2 A problem peculiar to Charpy-type tests occurs 
when high-strength, low-energy specimens are tested at low 
temperatures. These specimens may not leave the machine in 
the direction of the pendulum swing but rather in a sidewise 
direction. To ensure that the broken halves of the specimens do 
not rebound off some component of the machine and contact 
the pendulum before it completes its swing, modifications may 
be necessary in older model machines. These modifications 
differ with machine design. Nevertheless the basic problem is 
the same in that provisions must be made to prevent rebound­
ing of the fractured specimens into any part of the swinging 
pendulum. Where design permits, the broken specimens may 
be deflected out of the sides of the machine and yet in other 
designs it may be necessary to contain the broken specimens 
within a certain area until the pendulum passes through the 
anvils. Some low-energy high-strength steel specimens leave 
impact machines at speeds in excess of 50 ft (15.3 m)/s 
although they were struck by a pendulum traveling at speeds 
approximately 17 ft (5.2 m)/s. If the force exerted on the 
pendulum by the broken specimens is sufficient, the pendulum 
will slow down and erroneously high energy values will be 
recorded. This problem accounts for many of the inconsisten­
cies in Charpy results reported by various investigators within 
the 10 to 25-ft-lbf (14 to 34 J) range. The Apparatus section 
(subsection regarding specimen clearance) of Test Methods 
E23 discusses the two basic machine designs and a modifica­
tion found to be satisfactory in minimizing jamming. 
AS.5 Velocity of Straining 
A5.5.1 Velocity of straining is likewise a variable that 
affects the notch behavior of steel. The impact test shows 
somewhat higher energy absorption values than the static tests 
above the transition temperature and yet, in some instances, the 
reverse is true below the transition temperature. 
AS.6 Correlation With Service 
A5.6.1 While Charpy or Izod tests may not directly predict 
the ductile or brittle behavior of steel as commonly used in 
large masses or as components of large structures, these tests 
can be used as acceptance tests of identity for different lots of 
the same steel or in choosing between different steels, when 
cmrelation with reliable service behavior has been established. 
It may be necessary to make the tests at properly chosen 
temperatures other than room temperature. In this, the service 
temperature or the transition temperature of full-scale speci­
mens does not give the desired transition temperatures for 
Charpy or Izod tests since the size and notch geometry may be 
so different. Chemical analysis, tension, and hardness tests may 
not indicate the influence of some of the important processing 
factors that affect susceptibility to brittle fracture nor do they 
comprehend the effect of low temperatures in inducing brittle 
behavior. 
A6. PROCEDURE FOR CONVERTING PERCENTAGE ELONGATION OF STANDARD ROUND TENSION TEST SPECIMEN 
TO EQUIVALENT PERCENTAGE ELONGATION OF STANDARD FLAT SPECIMEN 
A6.1 Scope 
A6. l .1 This method specifies a procedure for converting 
percentage elongation after fracture obtained in a standard 
0.500-in. (12.7 mm) diameter by 2-in. (51 mm) gauge length 
test specimen to standard flat test specimens ½ by 2 in. and 1 ½ 
by 8 in. (38.1 by 203 mm). 
A6.2 Basic Equation 
A6.2.1 The conversion data in this method are based on an 
equation by Bertella, and used by Oliver and others. The 
relationship between elongations in the standard 0.500-in.

A6.3 Application 
A6.3.1 In applying the above equation the constant a is 
characteristic of the test material. The value a = 0.4 has been 
found to give satisfactory conversions for carbon, carbon­
manganese, molybdenum, and chromium-molybdenum steels

The testing requirements for steel reinforcing bars contained in this annex have been integrated into the relevant prod­
uct specifications. 
AlO. PROCEDURE FOR USE AND CONTROL OF HEAT-CYCLE SIMULATION 
Al0.1 Purpose 
Al0.1.1 To ensure consistent and reproducible heat treat­
ments of production forgings and the test specimens that 
represent them when the practice of heat-cycle simulation is 
used. 
Al0.2 Scope 
A 10 .2.1 Generation and documentation of actual production 
time-temperature curves (MASTER CHARTS). 
Al0.2.2 Controls for duplicating the master cycle during 
heat treatment of production forgings. (Heat treating within the 
essential variables established during Al.2.1.) 
Al0.2.3 Preparation of program charts for the simulator 
unit. 
Al0.2.4 Monitoring and inspection of the simulated cycle 
within the limits established by the ASME Code. 
Al0.2.5 Documentation and storage of all controls, 
inspections, charts, and curves. 
Al0.3 Referenced Documents 
Al0.3.1 ASME Standards: 
Al0.3.1.1 ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section 
III, latest edition. 
630 
Al0.3.1.2 ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section 
VIII, Division 2, latest edition. 
Al0.4 Procedure 
Al0.4.1 Production Master Charts: 
Al0.4.1.1 Thermocouples shall be imbedded in each forg­
ing from which a master chart is obtained. Temperature shall be 
monitored by a recorder with resolution sufficient to clearly 
define all aspects of the heating, holding, and cooling process. 
All charts are to be clearly identified with all pertinent 
information and identification required for maintaining perma­
nent records. 
Al0.4.1.2 Thermocouples shall be imbedded 180° apart if 
the material specification requires test locations 180° apart. 
Al0.4.1.3 One master chart (or two if required in accor­
dance with Al0.4.3.1) shall be produced to represent essen­
tially identical forgings (same size and shape). Any change in 
size or geometry (exceeding rough machining tolerances) of a 
forging will necessitate that a new master cooling curve be 
developed. 
Al0.4.1.4 If more than one curve is required per master 
forging (180° apart) and a difference in cooling rate is 
achieved, then the most conservative curve shall be used as the 
master curve.

Al0.4.2 Reproducibility of Heat Treatment Parameters on 
Production Forgings: 
Al0.4.2.1 All information pertarnmg to the quench and 
temper of the master forging shall be recorded on an appro­
priate permanent record, similar to the one shown in Table 
AlO.l. 
Al0.4.2.2 All information pertaining to the quench and 
temper of the production forgings shall be appropriately 
recorded, preferably on a form similar to that used in 
Al0.4.2.1. Quench records of production forgings shall be 
retained for future reference. The quench and temper record of 
the master forging shall be retained as a permanent record. 
Al0.4.2.3 A copy of the master forging record shall be 
stored with the heat treatment record of the production forging. 
Al0.4.2.4 The essential variables, as set forth on the heat 
treat record, shall be controlled within the given parameters on 
the production forging. 
Al0.4.2.5 The temperature of the quenching medium prior 
to quenching each production forging shall be equal to or lower 
than the temperature of the quenching medium prior to 
quenching the master forging. 
Al0.4.2.6 The time elapsed from opening the furnace door 
to quench for the production forging shall not exceed that 
elapsed for the master forging. 
Al0.4.2.7 If the time parameter is exceeded in opening the 
furnace door to beginning of quench, the forging shall be 
placed back into the furnace and brought back up to equaliza­
tion temperature. 
Al0.4.2.8 All forgings represented by the same master 
forging shall be quenched with like orientation to the surface of 
the quench bath. 
Al0.4.2.9 All production forgings shall be quenched in the 
same quench tank, with the same agitation as the master 
forging. 
Al0.4.2.10 Uniformity of Heat Treat Parameters-(]) The 
difference in actual heat treating temperature between produc­
tion forgings and the master forging used to establish the 
simulator cycle for them shall not exceed ± 25 °F ( ± 14 °C) for 
the quench cycle. (2) The tempering temperature of the 
production forgings shall not fall below the actual tempering 
temperature of the master forging. (3) At least one contact 
surface thermocouple shall be placed on each forging in a 
production load. Temperature shall be recorded for all surface 
thermocouples on a Time Temperature Recorder and such 
records shall be retained as permanent documentation. 
Al0.4.3 Heat-cycle Simulation: 
Al0.4.3.1 Program charts shall be made from the data 
recorded on the master chart. All test specimens shall be given 
the same heating rate above, the ACl, the same holding time 
and the same cooling rate as the production forgings. 
Al0.4.3.2 The heating cycle above theACl, a portion of the 
holding cycle, and the cooling portion of the master chart shall 
be duplicated and the allowable limits on temperature and time, 
as specified in (a) through (c), shall be established for 
verification of the adequacy of the simulated heat treatment. 
( a) Heat Cycle Simulation of Test Coupon Heat Treatment 
for Quenched and Tempered Forgings and Bars-If cooling 
rate data for the forgings and bars and cooling rate control 
devices for the test specimens are available, the test specimens 
may be heat-treated in the device. 
(b) The test coupons shall be heated to substantially the 
same maximum temperature as the forgings or bars. The test 
coupons shall be cooled at a rate similar to and no faster than 
the cooling rate representative of the test locations and shall be 
within 25 °F (14 °C) and 20 sat all temperatures after cooling 
begins. The test coupons shall be subsequently heat treated in 
accordance with the thermal treatments below the critical 
temperature including tempering and simulated post weld heat 
treatment. 
(c) Simulated Post Weld Heat Treatment of Test Specimens 
(for ferritic steel forgings and bars)-Except for carbon steel (P 
Number 1, Section IX of the Code) forgings and bars with a 
nominal thickness or diameter of 2 in. (51 mm) or less, the test 
specimens shall be given a heat treatment to simulate any 
thermal treatments below the critical temperature that the

forgings and bars may receive during fabrication. The simu­
lated heat treatment shall utilize temperatures, times, and 
cooling rates as specified on the order. The total time at 
temperature( s) for the test material shall be at least 80 % of the 
total time at temperature(s) to which the forgings and bars are 
subjected during postweld heat treatment. The total time at 
temperature(s) for the test specimens may be performed in a 
single cycle. 
Al0.4.3.3 Prior to heat treatment in the simulator unit, test 
specimens shall be machined to standard sizes that have been 
determined to allow adequately for subsequent removal of 
decarb and oxidation. 
Al0.4.3.4 At least one thermocouple per specimen shall be 
used for continuous recording of temperature on an indepen­
dent external temperature-monitoring source. Due to the sen­
sitivity and design peculiarities of the heating chamber of 
certain equipment, it is mandatory that the hot junctions of 
control and monitoring thermocouples always be placed in the 
same relative position with respect to the heating source 
(generally infrared lamps). 
Al0.4.3.5 Each individual specimen shall be identified, and 
such identification shall be clearly shown on the simulator 
chart and simulator cycle record. 
Al0.4.3.6 The simulator chart shall be compared to the 
master chart for accurate reproduction of simulated quench in 
accordance with Al0.4.3.2(a). If any one specimen is not heat 
treated within the acceptable limits of temperature and time, 
such specimen shall be discarded and replaced by a newly 
machined specimen. Documentation of such action and reasons 
for deviation from the master chart shall be shown on the 
simulator chart, and on the co1Tesponding nonconformance 
repmi. 
Al0.4.4 Reheat Treatment and Retesting: 
Al0.4.4.1 In the event of a test failure, retesting shall be 
handled in accordance with rules set forth by the material 
specification. 
Al0.4.4.2 If retesting is permissible, a new test specimen 
shall be heat treated the same as previously. The production 
forging that it represents will have received the same heat 
treatment. If the test passes, the forging shall be acceptable. If 
it fails, the forging shall be rejected or shall be subject to reheat 
treatment if permissible. 
Al0.4.4.3 If reheat treatment is permissible, proceed as 
follows: ( 1) Reheat treatment same as original heat treatment 
(time, temperature, cooling rate). Using new test specimens 
from an area as close as possible to the original specimens, 
repeat the austenitize and quench cycles twice, followed by the 
tempering cycle (double quench and temper). The production 
forging shall be given the identical double quench and temper 
as its test specimens above. (2) Reheat treatment using a new 
heat treatment practice. Any change in time, temperature, or 
cooling rate shall constitute a new heat treatment practice. A 
new master curve shall be produced and the simulation and 
testing shall proceed as originally set forth. 
632 
Al0.4.4.4 In summation, each test specimen and its corre­
sponding forging shall receive identical heat treatment or heat 
treatment; otherwise the testing shall be invalid. 
Al0.4.5 Storage, Recall, and Documentation of Heat-cycle 
Simulation Data-All records pertaining to heat-cycle simula­
tion shall be maintained and held for a period of ten years or as 
designed by the customer. Information shall be so organized 
that all practices can be verified by adequate documented 
records.

1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
634 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other, and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined. 
1.3 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation (SI units), the mate1ial shall be furnished to 
inch-pound units. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the

treatment as the cylinders it represents. The method of quench­
ing the test ring shall duplicate that of the cylinders; if the 
cylinders aTe quenched from the outside only, then the test ring 
shall have its ends closed. The length of test rings that will be 
liquid quenched shall be at least 24 in. [610 mm]. The ends of 
such test rings may be vented to prevent pressure buildup 
during heat treating. 
6.4.2 Test specimens representing vessel covers or similar 
components may be taken from a full-section prolongation of 
the cover, a representative forging, or an integral prolongation 
when the part is contour machined before heat treatment. 
6.4.2.1 Test specimens taken from full size prolongations or 
representative forgings shall be located at a position midway 
between the center and the surface. 
6.4.2.2 When forgings are contour machined before heat 
treatment so that highly stressed surfaces are exposed, the test 
specimens may be taken at an equal distance (t) from the 
nearest quenched surface as the highly stressed area but not 
less than ¾ in. [20 mm]. The location of the specimens from a 
second surface shall be at least the greater of 1 ½ in. [40 mm] 
or 2t. 
6.5 Number of Tests: 
6.5.1 Up to 200 like forgings, each with a heat-treated 
weight of less than 1000 lb [450 kg] when heat treated in a 
single-batch furnace charge, shall have one tension test taken in 
accordance with 6.4.1 or 6.4.2 to represent each heat. In 
addition, for hollow or bored forgings, one bend or flattening 
test shall be taken in accordance with 6.3. 
6.5.2 Like forgings, weighing less than 1000 lb [450 kg] 
each when heat treated in a continuous furnace, shall have one 
tensile test taken to represent each heat and not more than 200 
forgings in any continuous period up to 4 h duration. In 
addition, bored or hollow forgings shall have one bend or 
flattening test talcen per heat per 200 forgings in any continuous 
period up to 4 h duration in accordance with 6.3. 
6.5.3 For heat-treated forgings weighing 1000 lb [ 450 kg] or 
more, one tension test shall be taken in accordance with 6.4.1 
or 6.4.2 to represent each heat and not more than ten forgings 
in a heat-treat lot. In addition, hollow or bored forgings shall 
have one bend or flattening test, taken in accordance with 6.3, 
to represent each ten or fewer forgings from the same heat and 
heat-treatment lot. 
6.6 Hardness Testing: 
6.6.1 Forgings under 1000 lb [ 450 kg] in weight, heat 
treated in a batch lot of up to 200 pieces (6.5.1) or in a 
continuous furnace run covering up to 200 pieces in up to 4 h 
production (6.5.2) shall be subject to a uniformity check by 
Brinell hardness testing or an equivalent method. For this 
purpose, 10 % of the furnace production shall be sampled and 
shall meet the minimum hardness specified in Table 2 for the 
type and shall also be within 20 Brinell points of the hardness 
of the forging from which the tensile test was taken. 
6.6.2 In the event that the test sample does not meet these 
criteria, the remainder of that production group shall be 
hardness tested and all of those forgings that fall outside these 
limits shall be retempered or reheat-treated at the manufactur­
er's option and retested. 
7. Magnetic Particle Examination 
7.1 All quenched and tempered forgings shall be subject to 
magnetic particle examination after heat treatment. The meth­
ods used shall be in accordance with Practice A275/A275M. 
7.2 Only direct current or rectified alternating (full or half 
wave) current shall be used as the electric power source for any 
of the magnetizing methods. 
7.3 The forgings shall be free from linear indications 
indicative of cracks. In case of doubt as to the type of condition 
giving rise to linear magnetic particle indications, they may be 
inspected for Type II indications referenced in Reference 
Photographs E433 when inspected by the liquid penetrant 
method in accordance with Practice E165/E165M. 
Alternatively, some other suitable method for classifying the 
indications may be used as agreed upon between the manufac­
turer and the purchaser. 
8. Workmanship 
8.1 If the thickness of a portion of the wall of a forging is 
less than that specified, the forgings may be accepted by the 
purchaser, provided that such irregularity will not require 
lowering the allowable working pressure below that for which 
the forging was designed. 
9. Repair Welding 
9.1 Repair welding shall be permitted when mutually agreed 
upon between the purchaser and the manufacturer and shall be 
performed in accordance with all the requirements of the 
applicable code or rules of construction.

SA-376/SA-376M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Seamless Austenitic Steel Pipe for High-Temperature 
Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers seamless austenitic steel pipe 
intended for high-temperature service. Among the grades 
covered are H grades and nitrogen grades that are specifically 
intended for high-temperature service. 
Norn I-This specification was 01iginally developed for use for piping 
in the central stations of electric-power generating thermal plants. 
However, its use is not restricted to such applications and it may be used 
in other applications for which the attributes of the materials, as defined by 
this specification, are appropriate. 
1.2 Optional supplementary requirements (Sl through SlO) 
are provided. These supplementary requirements specify addi­
tional tests that will be made only when stated in the order, 
together with the number of such tests required. 
1.3 Grades TP321 and TP321H have lower strength require­
ments for nominal wall thicknesses greater than 3/s in. [9.5 
mm]. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
Norn 2-The dimensionless designators NPS (nominal pipe size) and 
DN (Diametre Nominel) have been substituted in this standard for such 
traditional tenns as "nominal diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
l .5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

8.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. 
9. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
9 .1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient number 
of visual surface impe1fections to provide reasonable assurance 
that they have been properly evaluated with respect to depth. 
Exploration of all surface imperfections is not required but may 
be necessary to assure compliance with 9.2. 
9.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 12½ % 
of the nominal wall thickness or encroach on the minimum 
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with such 
defects shall be given one of the following dispositions:

were 75 [520] and 30 [21 OJ respectively, for nominal wall greater than 0.375 in. 
[9.5 mm]. 
9.3.1 Mechanical marks, abrasions (see Note 3), and pits, 
any of which imperfections are deeper than 1/16 in. [1.6 mm]. 
Norn 3-Marks and abrasions are defined as cable marks, dinges, guide 
marks, roll marks, ball scratches, scores, die marks, and so forth. 
9.3.2 Visual imperfections commonly refened to as scabs, 
seams, laps, tears, or slivers found by exploration in accor­
dance with 9 .1 to be deeper than 5 % of the nominal wall 
thickness. 
9.4 At the purchaser's discretion, pipe shall be subject to 
rejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 9.2 are not 
scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is 
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall 
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
9 .5 When imperfections or defects are removed by grinding, 
a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the wall 
thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by this 
specification. The outside diameter at the point of grinding may 
be reduced by the amount so removed. 
9.5.1 Wall thickness measurements shall be made with a 
mechanical caliper or with a properly calibrated nondestructive 
testing device of appropriate accuracy. In case of dispute, the 
measurement determined by use of the mechanical caliper shall 
govern.

approval of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification 
A999/A999M. 
9.7 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight. 
9.8 The pipe shall be free of scale and contaminating iron 
particles. Pickling, blasting, or surface finishing is not manda­
tory when pipe is bright annealed. The purchaser may request 
that a passivating treatment be applied.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-376/SA-376M 
10. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
10.1 Each pipe shall be subjected to the Nondestmctive 
Electric Test or the Hydrostatic Test. Unless specified by the 
purchaser, either test may be used at the option of the producer. 
10.2 Hydrostatic Test-Each length of finished pipe shall be 
subjected to the hydrostatic test in accordance with Specifica­
tion A999/ A999M, unless specifically exempted under the 
provisions of 10.3 and 10.4. 
10.3 For pipe sizes NPS 24 [DN 600] and over, the 
purchaser, with the agreement of the manufacturer, may 
complete the hydrostatic test requirement with the system 
pressure test, which may be lower or higher than the specifi­
cation test pressure, but in no case shall the test pressure be 
lower than the system design pressure. Each length of pipe 
furnished without the completed manufacturer's hydrostatic 
test shall include with the mandatory marking the letters "NH." 
10.4 Nondestructive Examination-Each pipe shall be ex­
amined with a nondestmctive test in accordance with Practice 
E213 or Practice E426. Unless specifically called out by the 
purchaser, the selection of the nondestructive electric test will 
be at the option of the manufacturer. The range of pipe sizes 
that may be examined by each method shall be subject to the 
limitations in the scope of the respective practices. 
10.4.1 The following information is for the benefit of the 
user of this specification: 
10.4.1.1 The reference standards defined in 10.10.1 through 
11.l 0.4 are convenient standards for calibration of nondestruc­
tive testing equipment. The dimensions of these standards 
should not be construed as the minimum size imperfection 
detectable by such equipment. 
10.4.1.2 The ultrasonic testing (UT) can be performed to 
detect both longitudinally and circumferentially oriented de­
fects. It should be recognized that different techniques should 
be employed to detect differently oriented imperfections. The 
examination may not detect short, deep, defects. 
10.4.1.3 The eddy-current testing (ET) referenced in Prac­
tice E426 has the capability of detecting significant 
discontinuities, especially the short abrupt type. 
10.4.1.4 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
10.5 Time of Examination-Nondestructive testing for 
specification acceptance shall be performed after all mechani­
cal processing, heat treatments, and straightening operations. 
This requirement does not preclude additional testing at earlier 
stages in the processing. 
10.6 Surface Condition: 
10.6.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, paint, 
or other foreign material that could interfere with interpretation 
of test results. The methods used for cleaning and preparing the 
surfaces for examination shall not be detrimental to the base 
metal or the surface finish. 
10.6.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can 
produce signals that interfere with the test. 
10.7 Extent of Examination: 
10.7.1 The relative motion of the pipe and the transducer(s), 
coil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire pipe surface is 
scanned, except as in 5.2. 
10.7.2 The existence of end effects is recognized, and the 
extent of such effects shall be determined by the manufacturer, 
and, if requested, shall be repo1ied to the purchaser. Other 
nondestmctive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
10.8 Operator Qualifications-The test unit operator shall 
be certified in accordance with SNT-TC-lA, or an equivalent 
recognized and documented standard. 
10.9 Test Conditions: 
10.9.1 For eddy-current testing, the excitation coil fre­
quency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration yet 
provide good signal-to-noise ratio. 
10.9.2 The maximum eddy-cmrent coil frequency used 
shall be as follows: 
Specified Wall Thickness, in. [mm] Maximum Frequency, KHz 
<0.050 [1.25] 100 
0.050 to 1.50 [1.25 to 3.80] 50 
>0.150 [3.80] 10 
10.9.3 Ultrasonic-For examination by the ultrasonic 
method, the minimum nominal transducer frequency shall be 
2.00 MHz and the maximum nominal transducer size shall be 
1.5 in. [38 mm]. 
10.9.3.1 If the equipment contains a reject notice filter 
setting, this shall remain off during calibration and testing 
unless linearity can be demonstrated at that setting. 
10.10 Reference Standards: 
10.10.1 Reference standards of convenient length shall be 
prepared from a length of pipe of the same grade, size (NPS, or 
outside diameter and schedule or wall tl1ickness), surface 
finish, and heat treatment condition as the pipe to be examined. 
10.10.2 For Ultrasonic Testing, the reference ID and OD 
notches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes 
shown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The 
depth of each notch shall not exceed 12½ % of the specified 
nominal wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], 
whichever is greater. The width of the notch shall not exceed 
twice the depth. Notches shall be placed on both the OD and ID 
surfaces. 
643 
10.10.3 For Eddy-Current Testing, the reference standard 
shall contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following discontinuities: 
10.10.3.1 Drilled Hole-The reference standard shall con­
tain three or more holes, equally spaced circumferentially 
around the pipe and longitudinally separated by a sufficient 
distance to allow distinct identification of the signal from each 
hole. The holes shall be drilled radially and completely through 
the pipe wall, with care being taken to avoid dist01iion of the 
pipe while drilling. One hole shall be drilled in the weld, if 
visible. Alternately, the producer of welded pipe may choose to 
drill one hole in the weld and mn the calibration standard 
through the test coils three times with the weld turned at 120° 
on each pass. The hole diameter shall vary with NPS as 
follows:

=== Page 694 ===

above 2 to 5 [50 to 125] 0.087 in. [2.2 mm] 
above 5 [125] 0.106 in. [2.7 mm] 
10.10.3.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool 
or file with a ¼-in. [6.4-rmn] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe. Said notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12½ % of the specified nominal wall thickness of 
the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.102 mm], whichever is greater. 
10.10.3.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] 
or less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to 
the tube axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to have a depth 
not exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of the 
pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. The length of 
the notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
10.10.3.4 More or smaller reference discontinuities, or both, 
may be used by agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
10.11 Standardization Procedure: 
10.11.1 The test apparatus shall be standardized at the 
beginning and end of each series of pipes of the same size 
(NPS or diameter and schedule or wall thickness), grade and 
heat treatment condition, and at intervals not exceeding 4 h. 
More frequent standardization may be performed at the manu­
facturer's option or may be required upon agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
10.11.2 The test apparatus shall also be standardized after 
any change in test system settings; change of operator; equip­
ment repair; or interruption due to power loss, process 
shutdown, or when a problem is suspected. 
10.11.3 The reference standard shall be passed through the 
test apparatus at the same speed and test system settings as the 
pipe to be tested. 
10.11.4 The signal-to-noise ratio for the reference standard 
shall be 2½ to 1 or greater. Extraneous signals caused by 
identifiable causes such as dings, scratches, dents, straightener 
marks, and so forth, shall not be considered noise. The 
rejection amplitude shall be adjusted to be at least 50 % of full 
scale of the readout display. 
10.11.5 If upon any standardization, the rejection amplitude 
has decreased by 29 % (3 dB) of peak height from the last 
standardization, the pipe since the last calibration shall be 
rejected. The test system settings may be changed, or the 
transducer(s), coil(s) or sensor(s) adjusted, and the unit 
restandardized, but all pipe tested since the last acceptable 
standardization must be retested for acceptance. 
10.12 Evaluation of Imperfections: 
10.12.1 Pipes producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
lowest signal produced by the reference standard(s) shall be 
identified and separated from the acceptable pipes. The area 
producing the signal may be reexamined. 
10.12.2 Such pipes shall be rejected if the test signal was 
produced by imperfections that cannot be identified or was 
produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. These pipes 
may be repaired in accordance with Sections 12 and 13. To be 
accepted, a repaired pipe must pass the same nondestructive 
644 
test by which it was rejected, and it must meet the minimum 
wall thickness requirements of this specification. 
10.12.3 If the test signals were produced by visual imper-
fections such as: 
(I) Scratches, 
(2) Surface roughness, 
(3) Dings, 
( 4) Straightener marks, 
(5) Cutting chips, 
(6) Steel die stamps, 
(7) Stop marks, or 
(8) Pipe reducer ripple. 
The pipe may be accepted based on visual examination 
provided the imperfection is less than 0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 
12½ % of the specified wall thickness (whichever is greater). 
10.12.4 Rejected pipe may be reconditioned and retested 
providing the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that 
required by this or the product specification. The outside 
diameter at the point of grinding may be reduced by the amount 
so removed. To be accepted, retested pipe shall meet the test 
requirement. 
10.12.5 If the imperfection is explored to the extent that it 
can be identified as non-rejectable, the pipe may be accepted 
without further test providing the imperfection does not en­
croach on the minimum wall thickness. 
11. Mechanical Tests Required 
11.1 Lot-For tension and flattening tests, the term "lot" 
shall be as follows: 
11.1.1 Where the final heat treated condition is obtained in

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
FOR PIPE REQUIRING SPECIAL CONSIDERATION 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the 
purchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided 
in the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, 
retest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. 
Sl. Product Analysis 
S 1. 1 Product analysis shall be made on each length of pipe. 
Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical compo­
sition requirements shall be rejected. 
S2. Transverse Tension Tests 
S2. l A transverse tension test shall be made on a specimen 
from one end or both ends of each pipe NPS 8 [DN 200] and 
over in nominal diameter. If this supplementary requirement is 
specified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. 
If a specimen from any length fails to meet the required tensile 
properties (tensile, yield, and elongation), that length shall be 
rejected subject to retreatment in accordance with Specification 
A999/ A999M and satisfactory retest. 
S3. Flattening Test 
S3.l The flattening test of Specification A999/A999M shall 
be made on a specimen from one end or both ends of each pipe. 
Crop ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is 
specified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. 
If a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility 
prior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening 
test requirement that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat­
ment in accordance with Specification A999/ A999M and 
satisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails 
because of a lack of soundness that length shall be rejected, 
unless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length 
is sound. 
S4. Etching Tests 
S4. l The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching 
tests conducted in accordance with the appropriate portions of 
Method E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section 
from one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound 
and reasonably uniform material free from injurious 
laminations, cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this 
supplementary requirement is specified, the number of tests per 
pipe required shall also be specified. If a specimen from any 
length shows objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, 
subject to removal of the defective end and subsequent retests 
indicating the remainder of the length to be sound and 
reasonably uniform material. 
SS. Photomicrographs 
S5.l Photornicrographs at 100 diameters may be made from 
one end of each piece of pipe furnished in sizes NPS 6 [DN 
150] and larger in the as-furnished condition. Such photomi­
crographs shall be suitably identified as to pipe size, wall 
thickness, piece number, and heat. Such photornicrographs are 
for information only, and shall show the actual metal structure 
of the pipe as finished.

SA-376/SA-376M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
S6. Ultrasonic Test 
S6.1 Each piece of pipe may be ultrasonically tested to 
determine its soundness throughout the entire length of the 
pipe. Each piece shall be ultrasonically tested in a circumfer­
ential direction in such a manner that the entire piece is 
scanned by the ultrasonic beam. The calibration standard shall 
be prepared from a section of pipe which has two notches, one 
in the inside surface and one in the outside smface. The notches 
shall be at least 1 ½-in. [38-mm] long and have a depth of 3 % 
of the wall thickness, or 0.004 in. [0.102 mm], whichever is the 
greater. Any pipe showing an ultrasonic indication of greater 
amplitude than the amplitude of the indication from the 
calibration standard shall be subject to rejection. 
S7. Hot Ductility Test for Indicating Weldability 
S7 .1 A high-temperature ductility test may be made upon 
each heat of mate1ial supplied in heavy-wall pipe sections. An 
appropriate specimen shall be heated to an initial temperature, 
cooled 100 °F [50 °C], then subjected to a tension test, and 
shall show a minimum reduction of area of 60 %. The initial 
temperature is that temperature 50 °F [30 °C] below the 
temperature at which material exhibits zero ductility. Rejection 
of material shall not be based upon this test. 
S8. Retests 
S8.l Upon the purchaser's request, retests shall be made 
from sections of material removed from any part of the pipe. 
Failure to meet the requirements stated in this specification 
shall be cause for rejection. 
S9. Stabilization Heat Treatment 
S9.1 Subsequent to the solution anneal required in 5.4, 
Grades TP321, TP321H, TP347, TP347H, TP348, and TP348H 
shall be given a stabilization heat treatment at a temperature 
lower than that used for the initial solution annealing heat 
treatment. The temperature of stabilization heat treatment shall 
be at a temperature as agreed upon between the purchaser and 
vendor. 
S10. Intergranular Corrosion Test 
S 10.1 When specified, material shall pass intergranular 
corrosion tests conducted by the manufacturer in accordance 
with Practices A262, Practice E. 
NoTE S 10.1-Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condition for 
low carbon or stabilized grades, and on the as-shipped condition for other 
grades. 
SI0.2 A stabilization heat treatment in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement S9 may be necessary and is 
permitted in order to meet this requirement for the grades 
containing titanium or columbium, particularly in their H 
versions.

Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Chromium­
Molybdenum 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers chromium-molybdenum alloy 
steel plates intended primarily for welded boilers and pressure 
vessels designed for elevated temperature service. 
1.2 Plates are available under this specification in several 
grades having different alloy contents as follows: 
Nominal Nominal 
Chromium Molybdenum 
Grade Content, % Content, % 
2 0~ 0~ 
12 1.00 0.50 
11 1.25 0.50 
22 2.25 1.00 
21 3.00 ·1.00 
5 5.00 0.50 
9 9.00 1.00 
91 9.00 1.00 
1.3 Each grade except Grade 91 is available in two classes 
of tensile strength levels as defined in the Tensile Requirements 
tables. Grade 91 is available only as Class 2. Grade 91 consists 
of two types, with Type 2 differentiated from Type 1 by 
requiring restricted composition for the enhancement of creep 
resistance. 
Norn I-Grade 911, previously covered by this specification, is now 
covered by Specification Al017/Al0l7M. 
1.4 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents. Therefore, each system mnst 
648 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with this specifi­
cation. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

[Identical with ASTM Specification A 395/ A 395M-99(2018).] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers ductile iron castings for 
pressure-retaining parts for use at elevated temperatures. 
Castings of all grades are suitable for use up to 450°F. For 
temperatures above 450°F and up to 650°F, only Grade 
60-40-18 castings are suitable (Note 1). 
1.2 Valves, flanges, pipe fittings, pumps, and other 
piping components are generally manufactured in advance 
and supplied from stock by the manufacturer, jobber, or 
dealer. 
1.3 For supplemental casting requirements, Specifica­
tion A 834 may be utilized. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
to the specification. 
NOTE I - For service other than as specified in this section, reference 
should be made to Specification A 536 for Ductile Iron Castings.

4.1.9 Metallographic option (see 12.1.1), 
4.1.10 Place of inspection (see 16.1), 
4.1.11 Certification requirements (see 17.1), 
4.1.12 Identification marking (see 18.2), and 
4.1.13 Supplemental Requirements (see 1.4, 7.4.2, 
Sl and S2). 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 The melting method and the nodularizing practice 
shall be optional with the foundry. 
5.2 Except as provided in 5.2.1, all castings Grade 
60-40-18 shall be given a ferritizing heat treatment that 
produces essentially a ferritic structure that contains no 
massive carbides. 
5.2.1 When specified in the purchase order, Grade 
60-40-18 castings may be provided in an as-cast condition 
provided they comply with the requirements of 7 .1 and 
7.2.1. 
5.2.2 Castings supplied in accordance with 5 .2.1 may 
be stress relieved by agreement between the manufacturer 
and purchaser. 
5.3 Castings Grade 65-45-15 may be provided in as­
cast condition or heat treated, provided they comply with 
the requirements of 7.1, 7.2.2, and 7.3.2. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 The casting shall conform to the following require­
ments for chemical composition (Note 2): 
Total carbon, min, % 
Silicon, max, % 
Phosphorus, max, % 
3.00 
2.50 
0.08 
6.1.1 The chemical analysis for total carbon shall be 
made on chilled cast pencil type specimens or from thin 
wafers approximately ½ 2 in. [0.8 mm] thick cut from test 
coupons. Drillings are not reliable because of the probable 
loss of graphite. 
6.1.2 For each reduction of 0.01 % below the maxi­
mum specified phosphorus content, an increase of 0.08% 
silicon above the specified maximum will be permitted up 
to a maximum of 2.75%. 
NOTE 2 - Silicon contents above 2.75%, or phosphorus contents above 
0.08 % have a tendency to lower the impact resistance of the material. 
If the carbon content is below 3.00%, excess cementite may form during 
cooling and if this is not removed during heat treatment, the impact 
resistance of the material may be lowered. 
7. Requirements 
7.1 Tensile Properties: 
7.1.1 The ductile iron as represented by the test 
specimens shall conform to the mechanical property 
requirements in Table 1. 
7.2 Hardness: 
7 .2.1 For Grade 60-40-18, the hardness of the cast­
ings and test specimens shall be within the limits in Table 1. 
655 
7.2.2 For Grade 65-45-15,the hardness oftest speci­
men and the critical area(s) of the casting, as identified on 
the casting drawing, shall be within the limits in Table 1. If 
the grade 65-45-15 casting drawing does not have critical 
area(s) of the casting identified, all areas of the casting 
shall be within the hardness limits in Table 1. 
7.3 Microstructure: 
7.3.1 For Grade 60-40-18, the microstructure of the 
separately cast test coupon or the casting shall be essen­
tially ferritic and contain no massive carbides, and have a 
minimum of 90% Type I and Type II Graphite as in Fig. 1 
or Plate I of Test Method A 247. 
7.3.2 For Grade 65-45-15, the microstructure of the 
critical areas of the casting, as identified on the casting 
drawing, shall be 45% pearlitic, maximum, contain no 
massive carbides, and have a minimum 90% Type I and 
Type II Graphite as in Fig. 1 or Plate I of Test Method 
A247. 
7.4 Pressure Test Requirements: 
7 .4.1 Each pressure retaining Grade 60-40-18 casting 
shall be tested after machining to the test pressure specified 
by the applicable standard of ANSI, ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code, or other pertinent code, and shall 
show no leaks. 
7.4.2 Castings Grade 65-45-15 manufactured under 
this specification shall be capable of passing hydrostatic 
test(s) compatible with the rating of the finished cast com­
ponent. Such tests shall be conducted by the casting manu­
facturer only when Supplementary Requirement S2 is 
specified.

=== Page 706 ===

SA-395/SA-395M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
7.4.3 Castings Grade 60-40-18, ordered under this 
specification not covered by ANSI standards and ASME 
Pressure Vessel Code, and castings for special service 
applications, shall be tested to such pressures as may be 
agreed upon by the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
7.4.4 For castings Grade 60-40-18, it is realized that 
the foundry may be unable to perform the hydrostatic test 
prior to shipment, or that the purchaser may wish to defer 
testing until additional work or machining has been per­
formed on the casting. Castings ordered in the rough state 
for final machining by the purchaser may be tested hydro­
statically prior to shipment by the manufacturer at pressures 
to be agreed upon with the purchaser. However, the foundry 
is responsible for the satisfactory pe1formance of the cast­
ings under the final hydrostatic test. 
8. Workmanship and Finish 
8.1 The surface of the casting shall be examined visu­
ally and shall be free from adhering sand, scale, cracks, 
and hot tears. Any other surface discontinuities shall meet 
visual acceptance standards specified in the order. 
9. Repair 
9.1 Castings for valves, flanges, pipe fittings, pumps, 
and other piping components ordered under applicable 
ANSI standards shall not be repaired by plugging, welding, 
brazing, or impregnation. 
9.2 Castings Grade 60-40-18 not covered in 9.1 which 
leak on hydrostatic tests may be repaired by plugging, 
provided the following requirements are met: 
9.2.1 No welding or brazing is permitted. 
9.2.2 The diameter of the plug shall not exceed the 
diameter of a standard 2 in. [ISO R2] pipe plug. 
9.2.3 The plugs, where practical, shall conform in 
all dimensions to the standard ISO ¾ plugs. In addition, 
they shall have full thread engagement corresponding to 
the thickness in the repaired section. Where a tapered plug 
is impractical because of the excess wall thickness in terms 
of plug diameter and coincident thread engagement, other 
types of plugs may be used provided both full engagement 
and effective sealing against pressure are obtained. Where 
possible, the ends of the plug should be ground smooth after 
installation to conform to the inside and outside contours of 
the wall of the pressure vessel or pressure part. 
9.2.4 The material from which the plug is manufac­
tured shall conform in all respects to the materials specifi­
cations that apply to the pressure vessel or pressure part. 
9.2.5 The area adjacent to the drilled hole shall be 
examined by radiography, and shall meet the Level 3 
acceptance requirements of Reference Radiographs E 689 
and supporting Reference Radiographs E 446, E 186, or 
E 280 as applicable and defined in accordance with Refer­
ence Radiographs E 689. 
9.2.6 The thickness of any repaired section in relation 
to the size of the plug used shall not be less than that given 
in Table 2. 
9.2.7 The minimum radius of repaired sections of 
cylinders or cones in relation to the size of plug used shall 
not be less than that given in Table 3. 
9.2.8 A repaired area may consist of a maximum of 
three plugs with a spacing such that the ligaments between 
adjacent plugs shall not be less than listed in Table 4. Other 
defective areas may also be repaired by plugging provided 
the minimum ligament between plugs in adjacent areas is 
not less than twice the distance from the nearest plug, the 
values for which are listed in Table 4. 
9 .3 Surface imperfections in castings Grade 60-40-18 
other than valves, flanges, pipe fittings, pumps, and other 
piping components may be repaired by plugging provided 
the depth of the plug is not greater than 20% of the thickness 
of the casting section and the diameter of the plug is not 
greater than its length. Repair of surface defects may not 
be done on pressure-containing portions of castings. The 
plug need not be threaded. The conditions of 9.2.1 and 
9.2.4 shall also be satisfied. 
10. Sampling 
10.1 A lot shall consist of one of the following: 
656 
10.1.1 All the metal from a single heating in a batch­
type melting furnace. 
10.1.2 All the metal poured from two or more batch­
type melting furnaces into a single ladle or a single casting. 
10.1.3 All the metal poured from a continuous melt­
ing furnace for a given period of time between changes in 
charge, processing conditions, or aim-for chemistry, or 8 h, 
whichever is the shorter period. 
11. Test Coupon 
11.1 The separately cast test coupons poured from the 
same lot as the castings they represent from which the 
tension test specimen is machined shall be cast to the size 
and shape shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, or Fig. 4. Cast coupons 
shall be identified with the castings they represent. Sec­
tioning procedure for removing test specimens from 
Y-blocks is shown in Fig. 5. 
11.1.1 Test samples may be removed from castings 
at locations designated on a drawing or as agreed to by 
manufacturer and purchaser.

=== Page 707 ===

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-395/SA-395M 
11.1.2 Test bars removed from castings shall con­
form to Fig. 6. The testing diameter shall be½ in. [12.5 mm] 
if possible. Smaller diameters shall be utilized if necessary. 
11.2 The test coupon size shall be as mutually agreed 
upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. In the 
absence of agreement, it shall be the option of the manufac­
turer. 
11.3 The test coupons shall be cast in molds made of 
suitable core sand having a minimum wall thickness of 
1½ in. [38 mm] for the ½ in. [12.5 mm], 1 in. [25 mm] 
sizes, and 3 in. [75 mm] for the 3 in. [75 mm] size. The 
coupons shall be left in the mold until they have changed 
to a black color (approximately 900°F [480°C] or less). 
The keel block as shown in Fig. 2 or the modified keel 
block produced from the mold shown in Fig. 4 may be 
substituted for the 1 in. [25 mm] block shown in Fig. 3. 
11.4 When investment castings are made to this speci­
fication, the manufacturer may use test specimens cast to 
size incorporated in the mold with the castings or separately 
cast to size using the same type of mold and the same 
thermal conditions that are used to produce the castings. 
These test specimens shall be made to the dimensions 
shown in Fig. 1 of Specification A 732/ A 732M or Fig. 5 
and Fig. 6 of Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
11.5 The manufacturer shall cast a sufficient number 
of test coupons to provide for each ferritizing anneal. The 
test coupons shall be heat treated with the castings they 
represent. Sectioning of the test coupons prior to heat treat­
ing is not permitted. 
11.6 The metallographic examination shall be made on 
a test lug from the test coupon shown in Fig. 7 or from a 
casting; or from a representative test coupon poured with 
the casting(s). The test coupon shall represent the metal 
treated with the nodularizing agent. 
12. Number of Tests and Retests 
12.1 One tension test shall be made from sections cut 
from the test coupons (Fig. 5) required by Section 11. 
12.1.1 Unless otherwise stated in the contract or 
order for castings, a metallographic examination may be 
substituted for the tension test when separately cast test 
coupons are used. When the microstructure option is used, 
a minimum of one tension test is required from each day's 
melt and for each heat treatment (see 12.2). 
12.2 If any tension test specimen shows obvious 
defects, another from the same coupon, or from another 
coupon/ or representing the same metal and the same anneal 
charge, may be tested. If an apparently sound test specimen 
fails to conform to this specification, castings may be re­
annealed, if required, and two retests made. If either retest 
fails to conform to this specification, the castings they 
represent shall be rejected. 
13. Tension Test Specimen Preparation 
13.1 The standard machined ½ in. [12.5 mm] round 
tension test specimen with 2 in. [50 mm] gage length as 
shown in Fig. 6 shall be used except where the ½ in. 
[12.5 mm] Y-block test coupon is required. In this case, 
either of the small size specimens, 0.375 or 0.250 in. 
[9 or 6.5 mm] round as shown in Fig. 6, shall be used. 
14. Test Methods 
14.1 Chemical analysis shall be made in accordance 
with Test Method E 1806. 
14.2 The yield strength shall be determined in accor­
dance with Test Methods E 8 using one of the following 
methods: 
14.2.1 The 0.2% off-set method, or 
14.2.2 Extension under load method where the yield 
strength may be determined as the stress producing an 
elongation under load of 0.375%; that is, 0.0075 in. 
[0.19 mm] in a gage length of 2 in. [50 mm]. 
14.3 The hardness of the ductile iron as represented 
by the test specimens and castings shall be determined in 
accordance with Test Method E 10. 
657 
14.4 The percentage of each graphite type shall be 
determined by manual counting, semi-automatic, or auto­
matic image analysis methods. The sum of all graphite 
types shall total to 100%. 
15. Records 
15.1 Records of the chemical composition,. mechanical 
properties, and metallographic examination, when applica­
ble, shall be systematically made and maintained. 
16. Inspection 
16.1 Unless otherwise specified in the contract or pur­
chase order, the manufacturer shall be responsible for car­
rying out all the tests and inspection required by this 
specification. 
16.2 The inspector representing the purchaser shall 
have entry at all time, while work on the contract of the 
purchaser is being performed, to all parts of the manufactur­
er's works which concern the manufacturer of the material 
ordered. The manufacturer shall afford the inspector all

SA-395/SA-395M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
reasonable facilities to satisfy him that the material is being 
furnished in accordance with these specifications. Unless 
otherwise specified, all tests and inspection shall be made 
at the place of manufacture or by an approved independent 
laboratory prior to shipment, and shall be so conducted as 
not to interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the 
works. 
17. Certification 
17.1 When agreed upon in writing by the purchaser 
and the supplier, a certification shall be made on the basis 
of acceptance of the material. This shall consist of a copy 
of the manufacturer's test report or a statement by the 
supplier accompanied by a copy of the test results, that 
the material has been sampled, tested, and inspected in 
accordance with the provisions of this specification. Each 
certification so furnished shall be signed by an authorized 
agent of the supplier or manufacturer. 
658 
18. Product Marking 
18.1 Castings for valves, flanges, pipe fittings, and 
unions shall be marked for material identification in accor­
dance with the Standard Marking System for Valves, 
Flanges, Pipe Fittings, and Unions, SP-25. Castings for 
gasketed mechanical couplings and fittings may be marked

(1) The reduced section may have a gradual taper from the ends toward the center, with the ends not more than 0.005 in. rn.13 mmJ larger in 
diameter than the center on the standard specimen, and not more than 0.003 in. [0.076 mmJ larger in diametel' than the center on the small 
size specimens. 
(2) If desired, on the small size specimens the length of the reduced section may be increased to accommodate an extensometer. However, reference 
marks for measurement of elongation should nevertheless be spaced at the indicated gage length. 
(3) The gage length and fillets shall be as shown, but the ends may be of any form to fit the holders of the testing machine in such a way that 
the load shall be axial. If the ends are to be held in grips it is desirable, to make the length of the grip section great enough to allow the 
specimen to extend into the grips a distance equal to two thirds or more of the length of the grips.

NoTE 3-The reduced section shall be parallel within 0.010 in. and may have a gradual taper in width from the ends toward the center, with the ends 
not more than 0.010 in. wider than the center. 
Norn 4-The ends of the specimen shall be symmetrical with the center line of the reduced section within 0.10 in. 
Norn 5-Metric equivalent: 1 in. = 25.4 mm. 
Norn 6-Specimens with sides parallel throughout their length are permitted, except for referee testing, provided: (a) the above tolerances are used; 
(b) an adequate number of marks are provided for determination of elongation; and (c) when yield strength is determined, a suitable extensometer is used. 
If the fracture occurs at a distance of less than 2A from the edge of the gripping device, the tensile properties determined may not be representative of 
the material. If the properties meet the minimum requirements specified, no further testing is required, but if they are less than the minimum requirements, 
discard the test and retest. 
Norn ?-Specimen 5 is intended for testing specimens removed from an in-service product. Specimen 5 shall not be used for conformance testing of 
new product. Acceptance criteria for elongation values obtained from 1 in. gauge length specimens shall be determined by agreement between the 
responsible parties.

through the pressure line under the control of a suitable valve. 
An accurately calibrated pressure gauge serves to measure oil 
pressure. Any air in the system is removed through the bleeder 
line. As the oil pressure is increased, the rubber gasket expands 
which in turn stresses the specimen circumferentially. As the 
pressure builds up, the lips of the rubber gasket act as a seal to 
prevent oil leakage. With continued increase in pressure, the 
ring specimen is subjected to a tension stress and elongates 
accordingly. The entire outside circumference of the ring 
specimen is considered as the gauge length and the strain is 
measured with a suitable extensometer which will be described 
later. When the desired total strain or extension under load is 
reached on the extensometer, the oil pressure in pounds per 
square inch is read and by employing Barlow's formula, the 
unit yield strength is calculated. The yield strength, thus 
determined, is a true result since the test specimen has not been

Norn 1-The dimension t is the thickness of the test specimen as 
provided for in the applicable material specifications. 
Norn 2-The reduced section shall be parallel within 0.010 in. and may 
have a gradual taper in width from the ends toward the center, with the 
ends not more than 0.010 in. wider than the center.

cold worked by flattening and closely approximates the same 
condition as the tubular section from which it is cut. Further, 
the test closely simulates service conditions in pipe lines. One 
testing machine unit may be used for several different sizes of 
pipe by the use of suitable rubber gaskets and adapters. 
Norn A2.3-Barlow's formula may be stated two ways:

NOTE 5 (page 641)
NoTE 5-For each of the four sizes of specimens, narrower widths (W and C) may be used when necessary. In such cases, the width of the reduced 
section should be as large as the width of the material being tested permits; however, unless stated specifically, the requirements for elongation in a product 
specification shall not apply when these narrower specimens are used. If the width of the material is less than W, the sides may be parallel throughout 
the length of the specimen.

NOTE 16 (page 655)
NoTE 16-For materials with toughness levels in excess of about 
50 ft-lbs, specimens containing the otiginal OD surface may yield values 
in excess of those resulting from the use of conventional Charpy 
specimens. 
23.2.2.3 If a standard full-size specimen cannot be prepared, 
the largest feasible standard subsize specimen shall be pre­
pared. The specimens shall be machined so that the specimen 
does not include material nearer to the surface than 0.020 in. 
(0.5 mm).
