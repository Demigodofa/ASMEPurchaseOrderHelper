cooled at a minimum rate of 300 °F [165 °C]/h in air or water
to a temperature not exceeding 600 °F [315 °C].

5. Chemical Composition

5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1.

5.2 When Grades 1, 6, or 10 are ordered under this
specification, supplying an alloy grade that specifically re-
quires the addition of any element other than those listed for
the ordered grade in Table 1 is not permitted. However, the
addition of elements required for the deoxidation of the steel is
permitted.

6. Product Analysis

6.1 At the request of the purchaser, an analysis of one billet
or two samples of flat-rolled stock from each heat or of two
pipes from each lot shall be made by the manufacturer. A lot of
pipe shall consist of the following:

NPS Designator Length of Pipe in Lot

Under 2 400 or fraction thereof
2to6 200 or fraction thereof
Over 6 100 or fraction thereof

6.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the
purchaser or the purchaser’s representative and shall conform
to the requirements specified.

6.3 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 6.1 does
not conform to the requirements specified, an analysis of each
billet or pipe from the same heat or lot may be made, and all
billets or pipe conforming to the requirements shall be ac-
cepted.

7. Tensile Requirements

7.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to
tensile properties prescribed in Table 2.

8. Impact Requirements

8.1 For Grades 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11, the notched-bar
impact properties of each set of three impact specimens,
including specimens for the welded joint in welded pipe with
wall thicknesses of 0.120 in. [3 mm] and larger, when tested at
temperatures in conformance with 14.1 shall be not less than
the values prescribed in Table 3.

8.1.1 If the impact value of one specimen is below the
minimum value, or the impact values of two specimens are less
than the minimum average value but not below the minimum
value permitted on a single specimen, a retest shall be allowed.
The retest shall consist of breaking three additional specimens
and each specimen must equal or exceed the required average
value. When an erratic result is caused by a defective
specimen, or there is uncertainty in test procedures, a retest will
be allowed.

8.2 For Grade 8 each of the notched bar impact specimens
shall display a lateral expansion opposite the notch of not less
than 0.015 in. [0.38 mm].

8.2.1 When the average lateral expansion value for the three
impact specimens equals or exceeds 0.015 in. [0.38 mm] and
the value for one specimen is below 0.015 in. [0.38 mm] but
not below 0.010 in. [0.25 mm], a retest of three additional

488

ASME BPVC.ILA-2025

specimens may be made. The lateral expansion of each of the
retest specimens must equal or exceed 0.015 in. [0.38 mm].

8.2.2 Lateral expansion values shall be determined by the
procedure in Test Methods and Definitions A370.

8.2.3 The values of absorbed energy in foot-pounds and the
fracture appearance in percentage shear shall be recorded for
information. A record of these values shall be retained for a
period of at least 2 years.

9. Lengths

9.1 If definite lengths are not required, pipe may be ordered
either in single random lengths of 16 to 22 ft (Note 4) with
maximum 5 % of the lengths between 12 and 16 ft (Note 4), or
in double random lengths with a minimum average of 35 ft
(Note 4) and an absolute minimum length of 22 ft (Note 4) with
maximum 5 % of the lengths between 16 and 22 ft (Note 4).

Note 4—This value(s) applies when the inch-pound designation of this
specification is the basis of purchase. When the “M” designation of this
specification is the basis of purchase, the corresponding metric value(s)
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser.

10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance

10.1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient num-
ber of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable
assurance that they have been properly evaluated with respect
to depth. Exploration of all surface imperfections is not
required but may be necessary to ensure compliance with 10.2.

10.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 12% %
of the nominal wall thickness or encroach on the minimum
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with such
defects shall be given one of the following dispositions:

10.2.1 The defect may be removed by grinding provided
that the remaining wall thickness is within specified limits.

10.2.2 Repaired in accordance with the repair welding
provisions of 10.5.

10.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect may be cut
off within the limits of requirements on length.

10.2.4 The defective pipe may be rejected.

10.3 To provide a workmanlike finish and basis for evalu-
ating conformance with 10.2, the pipe manufacturer shall
remove by grinding the following:

10.3.1 Mechanical marks, abrasions and pits, any of which
imperfections are deeper than Yio in. [1.6 mm], and

10.3.2 Visual imperfections commonly referred to as scabs,
seams, laps, tears, or slivers found by exploration in accor-
dance with 10.1 to be deeper than 5 % of the nominal wall
thickness.

10.4 At the purchaser’s discretion, pipe shall be subject to
rejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 10.2 are not
scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the
purchaser.

10.5 When imperfections or defects are removed by
grinding, a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the
wall thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by
