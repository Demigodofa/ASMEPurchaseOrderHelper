3. Terminology

3.1 Definitions:
3.1.1 For definitions of terms used in these test methods and
practices, see Terminology A941.

SA-751

3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard:

3.2.1 product, check, or verification analysis, n—a chemical
analysis of the semifinished or finished product, usually for the
purpose of determining conformance to the specification re-
quirements.

3.2.1.1 Discussion—The range of the specified composition
applicable to product analysis is normally greater than that
applicable to heat analysis in order to take into account
deviations associated with analytical reproducibility (Note 1)
and the heterogeneity of the steel.

Nore 1—All of the chemical analysis procedures referenced in these
test methods include precision statements with reproducibility data, with
the exception of Test Methods E50.

3.2.2 product analysis tolerances, n—a permissible varia-
tion over the maximum limit or under the minimum limit of a
specified element and applicable only to product analyses, not
cast or heat analyses (Note 2).

Norse 2—The term “analysis tolerance” is often misunderstood. It does
not apply to cast or heat analyses determined to show conformance to
specified chemical limits. It applies only to product analysis and becomes
meaningful only when the heat analysis of an element falls close to one of
the specified limits. For example, stainless steel UNS 30400 limits for
chromium are 18.00 to 20.00 %. A heat that the producer reported as
18.01 % chromium may be found to show 17.80 % chromium by a user
performing a product analysis. If the product analysis tolerance for such a
chromium level is 0.20 %, the product analysis of 17.80 % chromium
would be acceptable. A product analysis of 17.79 % would not be
acceptable.

3.2.3 proprietary analytical method, n—a non-standard ana-
lytical method, not published by ASTM, utilizing reference
standards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), when available, or other sources refer-
enced in Section 10.

3.2.4 referee analysis, n—performed using ASTM test
methods listed in 9.1.1, NIST reference standards or methods,
and reference standards agreed upon between parties.

3.2.4.1 Discussion—The selection of a laboratory to per-
form the referee analysis shall be a matter of agreement
between the supplier and the purchaser.

3.2.5 certified reference material, n—a specimen of material
specially prepared, analyzed, and certified for chemical content
under the jurisdiction of a recognized standardizing agency or
group, such as the NIST, for use by analytical laboratories as an
accurate basis for comparison.

3.2.5.1 Discussion—Reference samples should bear suffi-
cient resemblance to the material to be analyzed so that no
significant differences are required in procedures or corrections
(for example, for interferences or inter-element effects).

3.2.6 working reference materials, n—zreference materials
used for routine analytical control and traceable to NIST
standards and other recognized standards when appropriate
standards are available.
