ASME BPVC.ILA-2025

12. Hydrostatic Tests
12.1 Hydrostatic testing is not required by this specification.

12.2 Each fitting of Class WP shall be capable of withstand-
ing without failure, leakage, or impairment of serviceability, a
test pressure equal to that prescribed for the specified matching
pipe or equivalent material.

12.3 Each fitting of Class CR, except tees covered in 12.3.1,
shall be capable of withstanding without failure, leakage, or
impairment of serviceability, a test pressure based on the
ratings in MSS SP-43.

12.3.1 Class CR tees fabricated using intersection welds
shall be capable of passing a hydrostatic test based on 70 % of
the ratings in MSS SP-43.

13. Rejection

13.1 Unless otherwise specified, any rejection based on tests
by the purchaser shall be reported to the manufacturer within
30 working days from the receipt of samples or test reports by
the purchaser.

13.2 Each fitting that develops surface discontinuities
deeper than 5 % of the specified nominal wall thickness in shop
working or application operations may be rejected and the
manufacturer so notified.

14. Rehearing

14.1 Test samples that represent fittings rejected by the
purchaser shall be preserved for four weeks from the date of
the rejection report. In case of dissatisfaction with the test
results, the manufacturer may make claim for a rehearing
within the period that the samples are preserved.

15. Test Reports

15.1 Test reports are required for all fittings covered by this
specification. Each test report shall include the following
information:

15.1.1 The year-date of the specification to which the fitting
was furnished,

15.1.2 Heat number or serial number traceable to a heat
number,

15.1.3 Chemical analysis for all starting materials,

15.1.4 Starting material; plate, bar, pipe (specify welded or
seamless), forging,

15.1.5 Mechanical test results (Section 8),

15.1.6 Seamless or welded construction,

15.1.7 For construction with filler metal added, weld metal
specification number,

SA-815/SA-815M

15.1.8 For welded fittings, construction method, weld pro-
cess, and procedure specification number,

15.1.9 Heat treatment type,

15.1.10 Results of all nondestructive examinations,

15.1.11 Results of all tests required by Supplementary
Requirements and the order, and

15.1.12 Statement that the fitting was manufactured,
sampled, tested, and inspected in accordance with the specifi-
cation and was found to meet the requirements.

16. Product Marking

16.1 All fittings shall have the prescribed information
stamped or otherwise suitably marked on each fitting in
accordance with Section 19 of Specification A960/A960M.

16.2 Marking paint or ink shall not contain harmful amounts
of chlorides, metals, or metallic salt, such as zinc or copper,
that cause corrosive attack on heating. On wall thicknesses
thinner than 0.083 in. [2.1 mm], no metal impression stamps
shall be used. Vibrating pencil marking is acceptable.

16.3 The prescribed information for butt-welding fittings
shall be: the manufacturer’s name or trademark (see Note 2),
schedule number or nominal wall thickness designation, size,
grade, class, and the heat number or manufacturer’s heat
identification.

16.4 The prescribed information for threaded or socket-
welding fittings shall be: the manufacturer’s name or trademark
(see Note 2), pressure class or schedule number, grade and
class, and heat number or manufacturer’s heat identification.
The class S marking need not be added to the material grade for
threaded or socket-welded fittings.

Nore 2—For purposes of identification marking, the manufacturer is
considered the organization that certifies that the piping component
complies with this specification.

16.5 Bar Coding—In addition to the requirements in
16.1-16.4, bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identifi-
cation method. The purchaser may specify in the order a
specific bar coding system to be used. The bar coding system,
if applied at the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent
with one of the published industry standards for bar coding. If
used on small fittings, the bar code may be applied to the box
or a substantially applied tag.
