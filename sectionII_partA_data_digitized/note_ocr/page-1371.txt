treated shall be tested in the heat treated condition in accor-
dance with the appropriate practice in Practices A763 for the
specified grade, or as agreed upon for TP409.

11.2 One full-section sample 1 in. [25 mm] long from each
lot of straight tubes shall be tested in the finished condition in
accordance with the appropriate practice in Practices A763 for
the specified grade, or as agreed upon for TP409.

11.3 The appearance of any fissures or cracks in the test
specimen, when evaluated in accordance with the Evaluation
Sections of Practices A763 indicating the presence of inter-
granular attack, shall be cause for rejection of that lot.

11.4 For corrosion test requirements, the term “lot” applies
to all tubes, prior to cutting to length, of the same nominal
diameter and wall thickness, produced from the same heat of
steel and annealed in a continuous furnace at the same
temperature, time at temperature, and furnace speed.

12. Permissible Variations in Dimensions (Fig. 1)

12.1 Permissible variations from the specified outside diam-
eter shall be in accordance with Specification A1016/A1016M.
Those tolerances do not apply to the bent portion of the
U-tubes. At the bent portion of a U-tube for R = 2 x D or
greater, neither the major nor minor diameter of the tube shall
deviate from the nominal diameter prior to bending by more
than 10 %. If less than 2 x D is specified, tolerances could be
greater.

12.2 Permissible Variations from the Specified Wall Thick-
ness:

12.2.1 Permissible variations from the specified minimum
wall thickness shall not exceed +20 - 0 %.

12.2.2 Permissible variations from the specified average
wall thickness are +10 % of the nominal wall thickness.

12.2.3 The wall thickness of the tube in the U-bent section
shall not be less than value determined by the equation:

__4RT
"> ERED
where:
bo= wall thickness after bending, in. [mm],
T = specified minimum tube wall thickness, in. [mm],
R_ = centerline bend radius, in. [mm], and
D_ = nominal outside tube diameter, in. [mm].

12.3 Permissible Variations from the Specified Length:

12.3.1 Straight Lengths—The maximum permissible varia-
tions for lengths 24 ft [7.3 m] and shorter shall be +¥% in. [+3
mm], —0; for lengths longer than 24 ft [7.3 m], an additional
over tolerance of + in. [+3 mm] for each 10 ft [3 m], or
fraction thereof, shall be permitted up to a maximum of +1 in.
[+13 mm].

12.3.2 U-Bends—In the case of U-tubes, the length of the
tube legs, as measured from the point of tangency of the bend
and the tube leg to the end of the tube leg, shall not be less than
specified, but may exceed the specified values by the amount
given in Table 5. The difference in lengths of the tube legs shall
not be greater than / in. [3 mm] unless otherwise specified.

12.4 The end of any tube may depart from square by not
more than the amount given in Table 6.

12.5 The leg spacing measured between the points of
tangency of the bend to the legs shall not vary from the value
(2R-specified tube outside diameter) by more than Mie in. [1.5
mm] where R is the center-line bend radius.

12.6 The bent portion of the U-tube shall be substantially
uniform in curvature, and not to exceed +o in. [£1.5 mm] of
the nominal center-line radius.

12.7 Permissible deviation from the plane of bend (see Fig.
1) shall not exceed Mc in. [1.5 mm] as measured from the
points of tangency.

13. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance

13.1 Tubing purchased to this specification is intended for
use in heat exchangers and will be inserted through close-
fitting holes in baffles or support plates, or both, spaced along
the tube length. The tube ends will also be inserted into very
close-fitting holes in a tubesheet and expanded and may be
welded therein. The tubes shall be able to stand roll expanding
(See Note 1) and bending without showing cracks and flaws,
and shall be finished reasonably straight and suitable for the
