SA-480/SA-480M (ASTM A480/A480M)

13. Finish for Plates

13.1 The types of finish available on plates are:

13.1.1 Hot-rolled or Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat
Treated—Scale not removed, an intermediate finish. Use of
plates in this condition is generally confined to heat-resisting
applications. Scale impairs corrosion resistance.

13.1.2 Hot-rolled or Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat
Treated, and Blast Cleaned or Pickled—Condition and finish
commonly preferred for corrosion-resisting and most heat-
resisting applications, essentially a No. 1 finish.

13.1.3 Hot-rolled or Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat
Treated, and Surface Cleaned and Polished—Polish finish is
generally No. 4 finish.

13.1.4 Hot-rolled or Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat
Treated, and Descaled, and Temper Passed—Smoother finish
for specialized applications.

13.1.5 Hot-rolled or Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat
Treated, and Descaled; and Cold-rolled, and Annealed or Heat
Treated, and Descaled, and Optionally Temper Passed—
Smooth finish with greater freedom from surface imperfections
than in 13.1.4.

14, Edges for Cold-rolled Strip

14.1 The types of edges available on strip products are:

14.1.1 No. 1 Edge—A rolled edge, either round or square as
specified.

14.1.2 No. 3 Edge—An edge produced by slitting.

14.1.3 No. 5 Edge—An approximately square edge pro-
duced by rolling or filing after slitting.

15. Heat Treatment

15.1 The heat treatments shown in this section are to be
followed unless otherwise specified in the applicable material
specification. Heat treatment thermal cycles shall be separate
from other thermal processing cycles; for example, in-process
thermal cycles are not permitted as a substitute for the separate
annealing cycle.

15.2 Austenitic Types:

15.2.1 The austenitic types shall be annealed in accordance
with Table A1.2.

15.2.2 The material shall be annealed to meet the mechani-
cal property requirements of the applicable material specifica-
tion unless otherwise stated in the material specification.

15.2.3 Except as indicated in Table A1.2, Series 300,
XM-15, N08800, $30415, S$30815, S31725, S31726, and
32615 austenitic chromium-nickel steels, when specified on
the purchase order, shall be capable of meeting the test for
resistance to intergranular corrosion specified in 18.2.

15.2.4 For grades stabilized with titanium or niobium, refer
to Note 5.

Nore 5—Solution-annealing temperatures above 1950 °F [1066 °C]
can impair the resistance to intergranular corrosion after subsequent
exposure to sensitizing conditions in the stabilized grades, types 309Cb,
309HCb, 310Cb, 310HCb, 316Ti, 316Cb, 321, 321H, 347, 347H, 348,
348H, S21640, S31740, $33425, S35140, S35135, and $35125. When
intergranular corrosion is of concern, the purchaser should specify the
corrosion test of 18.2 (to be conducted on sensitized specimens). The
manufacturer is permitted, if necessary, use a lower temperature resolution
anneal or a stabilization anneal after a high temperature solution anneal in

790

ASME BPVC.ILA-2025

order to meet corrosion test requirements. Consideration should be given
to the corrosive media before using a stabilization anneal at less than
1800 °F [982 °C], as such treatment is not equally effective for all media.

15.2.5 For the stabilized H types, it is noted that the heat
treatment requirements shown in Table A1.2 differ as a
function of whether the material was cold worked or hot
finished.

15.2.6 The chromium-manganese-nickel types (201, 202,
$20103, S20400, $20153, S21800, S21640, XM-11, XM-17,
XM-18, XM-19, XM-29, and XM-31) shall be solution an-
nealed to meet the mechanical property requirements of the
applicable material specification and to exhibit adequate resis-
tance to intergranular corrosion (see 18.2). For S20161, the
heat treatment is specified in Table A1.2. For 21640, see Note
5.

15.2.6.1 Note that some of these types contain high carbon
content that can adversely affect resistance to intergranular
corrosion.

15.3 Duplex Types—The duplex types shall be solution
annealed in accordance with Table A1.2.

15.4 Martensitic and Ferritic Types:

15.4.1 The chromium steels (S32803, 400 Series, 40945,
S41045, S41050, $41500, S43932, S44400, S44537, $44635,
S44660, S44700, S44735, S44800, XM-27, and XM-33) shall
be heat treated in such a manner as to satisfy all the require-
ments for mechanical and bending properties specified in the
applicable material specification and (except for 400 Series,
841050, and $41500) to provide for adequate resistance to
intergranular attack.

15.4.2 For 41500, heat to 1750 °F [955 °C] minimum, air
cool to 200 °F [93 °C] or lower prior to any optional interme-
diate temper and prior to final temper. The final temper shall be
between 1050 °F and 1150 °F [566 °C and 621 °C].

16. Number of Tests

16.1 Unless otherwise specified by the applicable material
specification or by agreement between the seller and the
purchaser to perform a greater number of tests, the following
number of tests are to be performed.

16.1.1 In the case of plate, sheet, and strip produced in coil
form, two or more hardness tests (one from each end of the
coil); one bend test, when required; one permeability test, when
required; and one or more tension tests shall be made on
specimens taken from each coil. If the hardness difference
between the two ends of the coil exceeds 5 HRB, or equivalent,
or if the material is temper rolled, tensile properties must be
determined on both coil ends.

16.1.2 In the case of plate, sheet, or strip produced in cut
lengths, one tension test; two tension tests if the material is
temper rolled (one tension test for single piece lots); one bend
test when required, and one or more hardness tests shall be
made on each 100 or less pieces of the same heat and nominal
thickness rolled separately or continuously and heat treated
within the same operating period, either as a lot or continu-
ously.

Nore 6—The term continuously, as applied to heat treatment, is meant
to describe a heat-treating operation in which one cut length follows
