Lower Temperatu res
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A671/A671M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.

furnished provided it complies with all other requirements of
this specification.

1.3 Several grades and classes of pipe are provided.

1.3.1 Grade designates the type of plate used as listed in 5.1.

1.3.2 Class designates the type of heat treatment performed
during manufacture of the pipe, whether the weld is radio-
graphically examined, and whether the pipe has been pressure
tested as listed in 1.3.3.

1.3.3 Class designations are as follows (Note 1):

Note 1—Selection of materials should be made with attention to
temperature of service. For such guidance, Specification A20/A20M may
be consulted.

1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the “M”
designation of this specification is specified in the order.

1.5 This international standard was developed in accor-
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
