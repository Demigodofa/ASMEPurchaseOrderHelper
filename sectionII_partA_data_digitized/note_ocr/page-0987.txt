3.1.9 Specification (A524 or A524M) designation,
3.1.10 Hydrostatic test (see 11.2).

3.1.11 End use of material, and

3.1.12 Special requirements.

4. General Requirements

4.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to
the applicable requirements of the current edition of Specifi-
cation A530/A530M unless otherwise provided herein.

5. Materials and Manufacture

5.1 Process:

5.1.1 The steel shall be killed steel made by one or more of
the following processes: electric-furnace, basic-oxygen, or any
other commercially viable process.

5.1.2 The steel shall be made to fine grain practice.

5.1.3 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast.
When steel of different grades are sequentially strand cast,
identification of the resultant transition material is required.
The producer shall remove the transition material by any
established procedure that positively separates the grades.

5.1.4 Pipe NPS 11% [DN 40] and under may be either hot
finished or cold drawn.

5.1.5 Unless otherwise specified, pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] and
over shall be furnished hot finished. When agreed upon
between the manufacturer and purchaser, cold-drawn pipe may
be furnished.

5.2 Heat Treatment—All hot-finished and cold-drawn pipe
shall be reheated to a temperature above 1550°F [845°C] and
followed by cooling in air or in the cooling chamber of a
controlled atmosphere furnace.

6. Chemical Composition

6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements
prescribed in Table 1.

7. Heat Analysis

7.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the
steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of the ele-
ments specified in Section 6. The chemical composition thus
determined, or that determined from a product analysis made
by the manufacturer, if the latter has not manufactured the
steel, shall be reported to the purchaser or the purchaser’s
representative, and shall conform to the requirements specified
in Section 6.

8. Product Analysis

8.1 At the request of the purchaser, analyses of two pipes
from each lot (Note 2) shall be made by the manufacturer from

SA-524/SA-524M

the finished pipe. The chemical composition thus determined
shall conform to the requirements specified in Section 6.

Nore 2—A lot shall consist of 400 lengths, or fraction thereof, for each
size NPS 2 [DN 50] up to but not including NPS 6 [DN 150], and of 200
lengths, or fraction thereof, for each size NPS 6 [DN 150] and over.

8.2 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 8.1 does
not conform to the requirements specified in Section 6,
analyses shall be made on additional pipe of double the original
number from the same lot, each of which shall conform to
requirements specified.

9. Physical Properties

9.1 Tensile Properties—The material shall conform to the
requirements as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2.

9.2. Bending Properties:

9.2.1 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] and under, a sufficient length
of pipe shall stand being bent cold through 90° around a
cylindrical mandrel, the diameter of which is twelve times the
nominal diameter of the pipe, without developing cracks.
When ordered for close coiling, the pipe shall stand being bent
cold through 180° around a cylindrical mandrel, the diameter
of which is eight times the nominal diameter of the pipe,
without failure.

9.2.2 For pipe whose diameter exceeds 25 in. [635 mm] and
whose diameter to wall thickness ratio is 7.0 or less, bend test
specimens shall be bent at room temperature through 180°
without cracking on the outside of the bent portion. The inside
diameter of the bend shall be 1 in. [25.4 mm]. This test shall be
in place of Section 10.

Note 3—Diameter to wall thickness ratio = specified outside diameter/
nominal wall thickness.
Example: For 28 in. [710 mm] diameter 5.000 in. [125 mm] thick pipe the
diameter to wall thickness ratio = 28/5 = 5.6.

10. Flattening Test Requirements

10.1 For pipe over NPS 2 [DN 50], a section of pipe not less
than 2% in. [63.5 mm] in length shall be flattened cold between
parallel plates until the opposite walls of the pipe meet.
Flattening tests shall be in accordance with Specification
A530/A530M, except that in the equation used to calculate the

—H-value,the following e constants shall be used:

0.07 for Grade |
0.08 for Grade Il

10.2 When low D-to-t ratio tubulars are tested, because the
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the
inside surface at the 6 and 12 o’clock locations, cracks at these
locations shall not be cause for rejection if the D-to-t ratio is
less than ten.

11. Hydrostatic Test Requirements
11.1 Each length of pipe shall be subjected to the hydro-
static pressure, except as provided in 11.2.

11.2 When specified in the order, pipe may be furnished
without hydrostatic testing and each length so furnished shall
include with the mandatory marking the letters “NH.”

11.3 When certification is required by the purchaser and the
hydrostatic test has been omitted, the certification shall clearly
