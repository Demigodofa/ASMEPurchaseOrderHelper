11. Mechanical Tests Required

11.1 Tension Test—One tension test shall be made on a
specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall
be made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50
tubes (Note 1).

11.2 Flattening Test—One flattening test shall be made on
specimens taken from each end of one finished tube, not the
one used for the flaring test, from each lot of not more than 125
tubes or fraction thereof.

11.3 Flaring Test—One flaring test shall be made on speci-
mens taken from each end of one finished tube, not the one
used for flattening test, from each lot of not more than 125
tubes or fraction thereof.

11.4 Hardness Test—Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot
(Note 1).

946

11.5 Hydrostatic Test—Each U-tube shall be subjected to a
hydrostatic test, using a noncorrosive fluid, or when agreed
upon between the purchaser and manufacturer, they may be
tested at 114 times the specified design working pressure.

12. Nondestructive Test (Electric Test)

12.1 Each tube shall be tested after the finish heat treatment
following the final cold-drawn pass by passing through a
nondestructive tester capable of detecting defects on the entire
cross section of the tube, in accordance with Specification
A450/A450M.

13. Packaging and Package Marking

13.1 The tubing shall be packaged or bundled in such a
manner as to prevent damage in ordinary handling and trans-
portation and identified by a tag with the name of the
manufacturer, purchase order number, specification number
and grade, and size.

13.2 In the case of U-tubes, each box shall be palletized and
legibly marked showing the manufacturer’s name, purchase
order number, specification number and grade, size, and
identification of items contained.

13.3 Bar Coding—In addition to the requirements in 13.1
and 13.2, bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identifi-
cation-method.-The purchaser may specify in the order a
specific bar coding system to be used.
