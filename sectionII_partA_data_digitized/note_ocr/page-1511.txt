3. Terminology

3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard:

3.1.1 can, n—the container used to encapsulate the powder
during the pressure consolidation process; it is partially or fully
removed from the final part.

3.1.2 compact, n—the consolidated powder from one can. It
may be used to make one or more parts.

3.1.3 consolidation, n—the bonding of adjacent powder
particles in a compact under pressure by heating to a tempera-
ture below the melting point of the powder.

3.1.4 fill stem, n—the part of the compact used to fill the can.
It is not usually integral to the part produced.

3.1.5 hot isostatic-pressing, n—a process for simultaneously
heating and forming a compact in which the powder is
contained in a sealed formable enclosure usually made from
metal and the so-contained powder is subjected to equal
pressure from all directions at a temperature high enough to
permit plastic deformation and consolidation of the powder
particles to take place.

3.1.6 lot, n—a number of parts made from a single powder
blend following the same manufacturing practice.

3.1.7 part, n—a single item coming from a compact, either
prior to or after machining.

3.1.8 powder blend, n—a homogeneous mixture of powder
from one or more heats of the same grade.

3.1.9 rough part, n—the part prior to final machining.

4. Ordering Information

4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify in the
purchase order all requirements that are necessary for material
ordered under this specification. Such requirements may
include, but are not limited to, the following:

SA-988/SA-988M

4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of parts),

4.1.2 Name of material or UNS number,

4.1.3 ASTM designation and year of issue,

4.1.4 Dimensions (tolerances and surface finishes should be
included),

4.1.5 Microstructure examination if required (5.1.4),

4.1.6 Inspection (15.1),

4.1.7 Whether rough part or finished machined part (8.2.2),

4.1.8 Supplementary requirements, if any,

4.1.9 Additional requirements (See 7.2 and 17.1), and

4.1.10 Requirement, if any, that the manufacturer shall
submit drawings for approval showing the shape of the rough
part before machining and the exact location of test specimen
material (See 9.3).

5. Materials and Manufacture

5.1 Manufacturing Practice:

5.1.1 Compacts shall be manufactured by placing a single
powder blend into a can, evacuating the can, and sealing it. The
can material shall be selected to ensure that it has no deleteri-
ous effect on the final product. The entire assembly shall be
heated and placed under sufficient pressure for a sufficient
period of time to ensure that the final consolidated part meets
the density requirements of 8.1.1.1. One or more parts shall be
machined from a single compact.

5.1.2 The powder shall be prealloyed and made by a melting
method capable of producing the specified chemical
composition, such as but not limited to, air or vacuum
induction melting, followed by gas atomization.

5.1.3 When powder from more than one heat of the same
grade is used to make a blend, the heats shall be mixed
thoroughly to ensure homogeneity.

5.1.4 The compact shall be sectioned and the microstructure
examined to check for porosity and other internal imperfec-
tions. It shall meet the requirements of 8.1.2. The sample shall
be taken from the fill stem or from a location in a part as agreed
upon by the manufacturer and purchaser.

5.1.5 Unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, the
manufacturer shall remove the can material from the surfaces
of the consolidated compacts by chemical or mechanical
methods such as by pickling or machining. This removal shall
be done before or after heat treatment at the option of the
manufacturer (See Note 1).

Nore 1—Often, it is advantageous to leave the can material in place
until after heat treatment or further thermal processing of the consolidated
compact.

5.1.6 Supplementary Requirements S19, $20, S21, and $22
are mandatory.

6. Chemical Composition

6.1 The steel, both as a blend and as a part, shall conform to
the requirements for chemical composition prescribed in Table
1, Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology of A751 shall
apply.

6.1.1 A representative sample of each blend of powder shall
be analyzed by the manufacturer to determine the percentage of
elements prescribed in Table 1. The blend shall conform to the
chemical composition requirements prescribed in Table 1.
