SA-1016/SA-1016M

very tight, through-the-wall defects or defects that extend an
appreciable distance into the wall without complete penetra-
tion.

25.2.6 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature
(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can
be detected in the specific application of these examinations
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular
products.

25.3 Time of Examination—Nondestructive examination for
specification acceptance shall be performed after all deforma-
tion processing, heat treating, welding, and straightening op-
erations. This requirement does not preclude additional testing
at earlier stages in the processing.

25.4 Surface Condition:

25.4.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, paint,
or other foreign material that could interfere with interpretation
of test results. The methods used for cleaning and preparing the
surfaces for examination shall not be detrimental to the base
metal or the surface finish.

25.4.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can
produce signals that interfere with the test.

25.5 Extent of Examination:

25.5.1 The relative motion of the tube and the transducer(s),
coil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire tube surface is
scanned, except for end effects as noted in 25.5.2.

25.5.2 The existence of end effects is recognized, and the
extent of such effects shall be determined by the manufacturer,
and, if requested, shall be reported to the purchaser. Other
nondestructive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer.

25.6 Operator Qualifications:

25.6.1 The test unit operator shall be certified in accordance
with SNT-TC-1A, or an equivalent documented standard
agreeable to both purchaser and manufacturer.

25.7 Test Conditions:

25.7.1 For examination by the ultrasonic method, the mini-
mum nominal transducer frequency shall be 2.0 MHz, and the
maximum transducer size shall be 1.5 in. [38 mm].

25.7.2 For eddy current testing, the excitation coil fre-
quency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration, yet
provide good signal-to-noise ratio.

25.7.2.1 The maximum coil frequency shall be:

Specified Wall Thickness, in. [mm] Maximum Frequency, kHz

<0.050 in. [1.25] 100
0.050 to 0.150 [1.25 to 3.80] 50
>0.150 [3.80] 10

25.8 Reference Standards:

25.8.1 Reference standards of convenient length shall be
prepared from a length of tube of the same grade, specified size
(outside diameter and wall thickness), surface finish, and heat
treatment condition as the tubing to be examined.

25.8.2 For eddy current testing, the reference standard shall
contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the
following discontinuities:

25.8.2.1 Drilled Hole—The reference standard shall contain
three or more holes, equally spaced circumferentially around

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025

the tube and longitudinally separated by a sufficient distance to
allow distinct identification of the signal from each hole. The
holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the tube
wall, with care being taken to avoid distortion of the tube while
drilling. The holes shall not be larger than 0.031 in. [0.8 mm]
in diameter. As an alternative, the producer may choose to drill
one hole and run the calibration standard through the test coil
three times, rotating the tube approximately 120° each time.
More passes with smaller angular increments may be used,
provided testing of the full 360° of the coil is obtained. For
welded tubing, if the weld is visible, one of the multiple holes
or the single hole shall be drilled in the weld.

25.8.2.2 Transverse Tangential Notch—Using a round tool
or file with a % in. [6.4 mm] diameter, a notch shall be milled
or filed tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu-
dinal axis of the tube. Said notch shall have a depth not
exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater.

25.8.2.3 Longitudinal Notch—A notch 0.031 in. (0.8 mm) or
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the
tube axis on the outside surface of the tube, to have a depth not
exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or
0.004 in. (0.1 mm), whichever is greater. The length of the
notch shall be compatible with the testing method.

25.8.2.4 When minimum wall tubing is specified, the notch
depth shall be based on the calculated average wall thickness
from Table 2 (see Note 3).

25.8.3 For ultrasonic testing, the reference ID and OD
notches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes
shown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The
depth of the notches shall not exceed 12.5 % of the specified
average wall thickness of the tube or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm],
whichever is greater. When minimum tubing is specified, the
notch depth shall be based on the calculated average wall
thickness from Table 2 (see Note 3). The width of the notch
shall not exceed two times the depth. For welded tubing, the
notches shall be placed in the weld, if the weld is visible. When
the notch is placed in the weld, the notch depth shall be
measured from the surface of the weld.

Nore 3—To calculate the average wall thickness when minimum wall
tubing is specified, the calculated average wall shall be the specified
minimum wall plus 2 of the Permitted Maximum Variation in Wall
Thickness cited in Table 2. For example, when a cold finished, 1 by 0.083
in. [25 by 2 mm] minimum wall seamless tube is specified, the calculated
average thickness will be 0.091 in. (0.083 in. + 4 (20 %)) [2.2 mm (2 mm
+ % (20 %))].

25.8.4 For flux leakage testing, the longitudinal reference
notches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a radial
plane parallel to the tube axis on the inside and outside surfaces
of the tube. Notch depth shall not exceed 12.5% of the
specified wall thickness or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is
greater. Notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25.4 mm], and the
width shall not exceed the depth. Outside and inside notches
shall have sufficient separation to allow distinct identification
of the signal from each notch.

25.8.5 When minimum wall tubing is specified, the notch
depth shall be based on the calculated average wall thickness
from Table 2 (see Note 3).
