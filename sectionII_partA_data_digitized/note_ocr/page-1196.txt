Specification for

ASME BPVC.ILA-2025

Electric-Fusion-Welded Steel Pipe for High-Pressure Service

at Moderate Temperatures

1. Scope

1.1 This specification covers steel pipe: electric-fusion-
welded with filler metal added, fabricated from pressure-vessel
quality plate of any of several analyses and strength levels and
suitable for high-pressure service at moderate temperatures.
Heat treatment may or may not be required to attain the desired
properties or to comply with applicable code requirements.
Supplementary requirements are provided for use when addi-
tional testing or examination is desired.

1.2 The specification nominally covers pipe 16 in. [400
mm] in outside diameter or larger with wall thicknesses up to
3 in. [75 mm], inclusive. Pipe having other dimensions may be
furnished provided it complies with all other requirements of
this specification.

1.3 Several grades and classes of pipe are provided.

1.3.1 Grade designates the type of plate used.

1.3.2 Class designates the type of heat treatment performed
during manufacture of the pipe, whether the weld is radio-
graphically examined, and whether the pipe has been pressure
tested as listed in 1.3.3.

1.3.3 Class designations are as follows (Note 1):

Nore 1—Selection of materials should be made with attention to
temperature of service. For such guidance, Specification A20/A20M may
be consulted.

1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the “M”
designation of this specification is specified in the order.

1.5 This international standard was developed in accor-
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
