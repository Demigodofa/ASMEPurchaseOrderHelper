crown, not to exceed “ie in. [2 mm]. Any weld reinforcement
may be removed at the manufacturer’s option or by agreement
between the manufacturer and purchaser. The contour of the
reinforcement should be reasonably smooth and free from
irregularities. The weld metal shall be fused uniformly into the
plate surface. No concavity of contour is permitted unless the
resulting thickness of weld metal is equal to or greater than the
minimum thickness of the adjacent base metal.

5.2.3 Weld defects, as determined by specified inspection
requirements, shall be repaired by removal to sound metal and
rewelding.

5.3 Heat Treatment:

5.3.1 Except as provided in 5.3.2, all pipe shall be furnished
in the heat-treated condition. For H grades and $30815,
separate solution heat treatments are required for solution
annealing; in-process heat treatments are not permitted as
a substitute for the separate solution heat treatments. The
heat-treatment procedure shall consist of heating the material to
a minimum temperature of 1900 °F [1040 °C], except for 31254,
§31266, and S30815 which shall be heat treated to 2100 °F
[1150°C] and 1920°F [1050 °C] respectively, S31727 and
§32053 which shall be heat treated in the range 1975 to 2155 °F
[1080 to 1180°C], S34565 which shall be heat treated in
2050 °F [1120 °C] to 2140 °F [1170 °C], and N08367, which
shall be heated to a minimum temperature of 2025 °F
[1107°C], all materials to be followed by quenching in
water or rapidly cooling by other means.

5.3.2 The purchase order shall specify one of the following
conditions if the heat-treated condition specified in 5.3.1 is not
desired by the purchaser:

5.3.2.1 A final heat-treatment temperature under 1900 °F
[1040 °C]. Each pipe supplied under this requirement shall be
stenciled with the final heat-treatment temperature in degrees
Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius after the suffix “HT.” Controlled
structural or special service characteristics may be specified as
a guide for the most suitable heat treatment.

5.3.2.2 DELETED

5.3.2.3 DELETED

5.4 A solution annealing temperature above 1950 °F
[1065 °C] may impair the resistance to intergranular corrosion
after subsequent exposure to sensitizing conditions in TP321,
TP347, and TP348. When specified by the purchaser, a lower
temperature stabilization or re-solution anneal shall be used
subsequent to the initial high temperature solution anneal (see
Supplementary Requirement SS).

6. Chemical Composition

6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical composition in
Table 1.

6.2 When specified on the purchase order, a product analy-
sis shall be supplied from one tube or coil of steel per heat. The
product analysis tolerance of Specification A480/A480M shall
apply.

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025

6.3 Unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, the
chemical composition of the welding filler metal shall conform
to the requirements of the applicable AWS specification for the
corresponding grade shown in Table 2. Grades with no filler
metal classification indicated shall be welded with filler metals
producing deposited weld metal having a composition in
accordance with the chemical composition specified in Table 1.
The method of analysis for nitrogen and cerium shall be a
matter of agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer.
The purchaser may choose a higher-alloy filler metal when
needed for corrosion resistance.

7. Tensile Requirements

7.1 The tensile properties of the plate or sheet used in
making the pipe shall conform to the requirements prescribed
in Table 3. Certified mill test reports shall be submitted to the
pipe manufacturer.

7.2. A transverse tension test taken across the welded joint of
the finished pipe shall meet the same minimum tensile strength
requirements as the sheet or plate. The weld section on the
tension specimen shall be in the same condition as the finished
pipe (with or without bead as specified).

8. Mechanical Tests Required

8.1 Tension Test—One transverse tension test of the weld
shall be made on each lot (Note 2) of finished pipe.

Nore 2—The term “lot” applies to each 200 ft [60 m] or less of pipe of
the same NPS and wall thickness (or schedule number) which is produced
from the same heat of steel and subjected to the same finishing treatment
in a continuous furnace. When final heat treatment is in a batch-type
furnace, the lot shall include only that pipe which is heat treated in the
same furnace charge. When no heat treatment is performed following final
forming operations, the lot shall include each 200 ft [60 m] or less of pipe
of the same NPS and wall thickness (or schedule number) which is
produced from the same heat of steel.

8.2 Transverse Guided-Bend Weld Test—One test (two
specimens) of the weld shall be made on each lot (Note 2) of
finished pipe.

8.3 Pressure or Nondestructive Electric Test—Each length
of pipe shall be subjected to a pressure test or a nondestructive
electric test as prescribed in Section 15.

9. Permissible Variations in Wall Thickness

9.1 The minimum wall thickness at any point shall not be
more than 0.018 in. [0.46 mm] under the specified wall
thickness. (This tolerance is slightly more than commercial
tolerances on sheet and plate to allow for possible loss of
thickness caused by manufacturing operations.)

10. Permissible Variations in Dimensions

10.1 Permissible variations in dimensions shall not exceed
the following at any point in each length of pipe.

10.1.1 Specified Diameter—Where the specified wall thick-
ness is less than 0.188 in. [4.8 mm], the actual outside
diameter, based on circumferential measurement, shall not vary
more than +0.20 % from the specified outside diameter. Where
the specified wall thickness is 0.188 in. [4.8 mm] and heavier,
the actual outside diameter, based on circumferential
