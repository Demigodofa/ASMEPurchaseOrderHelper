4 The stress area is calculated as follows:
As = 0.7854 [D — (0.9743/n) |?
where
As = stress area, in.?,
D = nominal bolt size, and
n= threads per inch.
® Loads tabulated are based on the following:

Bolt Size, in. Column 3 Column 4 Column 5
Y2 to 1, incl 120 000 psi 85 000 psi 92 000 psi
1% to 1%, incl 105 000 psi 74 000 psi 81 000 psi

6.3.1 Definition—The rotational capacity test is intended to
evaluate the presence of a lubricant, the efficiency of the
lubricant, and the compatibility of assemblies as represented by
the components selected for testing.

6.3.2 Requirement—Zinc-coated bolts, zinc-coated washers,
and zinc-coated and lubricated nuts tested full size in an
assembled joint or tension measuring device, in accordance
with 10.2, shall not show signs of failure when subjected to the
nut rotation in Table 6. The test shall be performed by the
responsible party (see Section 14) prior to shipment after zinc
coating and lubrication of nuts (see 10.2 and Note 4).

6.3.3 Acceptance Criterion—The bolt and nut assembly
shall be considered as non-conforming if the assembly fails to
pass any one of the following specified requirements:

6.3.3.1 Inability to install the assembly to the nut rotation in
Table 6.

6.3.3.2 Inability to remove the nut after installing to the
rotation specified in Table 6.

6.3.3.3 Shear failure of the threads as determined by visual
examination of bolt and nut threads following removal.

6.3.3.4 Torsional or torsional/tension failure of the bolt.
Elongation of the bolt, in the threads between the nut and bolt
head, is to be expected at the required rotation and is not to be
classified as a failure.

7. Dimensions

7.1 Head and Body:
7.1.1 The bolts shall conform to the dimensions for heavy
hex structural bolts specified in ASME B18.2.6.

478

ASME BPVC.IL.A-2025

7.1.2 The thread length shall not be changed except as
provided in Supplementary Requirement S1. Bolts with thread
lengths other than those required by this specification shall be
ordered under Specification A449.

7.2 Threads:

7.2.1 Uncoated—Threads shall be the Unified Coarse
Thread Series as specified in ASME B1.1, and shall have Class
2A tolerances.

7.2.2 Coated—Unless otherwise specified, zinc-coated bolts
to be used with zinc-coated nuts or tapped holes that are tapped
oversize, in accordance with Specification A563, shall have
Class 2A threads before hot-dip or mechanically deposited zinc
coating. After zinc coating, the maximum limits of pitch and
major diameter shall not exceed the Class 2A limit by more
than the following amounts:

Oversize Limit, in.4

Hot-Di Mechanical

Nominal Bolt Zine Zinc
Diameter (in.)

Ya 0.018 0.012

Se , Ye, Va 0.020 0.013

% 0.022 0.015

1to 1% 0.024 0.016

1% , 1% 0.027 0.018

AHot-dip zinc nuts are tapped oversize after coating, and mechanical zinc-
coated nuts are tapped oversize before coating.

7.2.3 The gaging limit for bolts shall be verified during
manufacture. In case of dispute, a calibrated thread ring gage of
the same size as the oversize limit in 7.2.2 (Class X tolerance,
gage tolerance plus) shall be used to verify compliance. The
gage shall assemble with hand effort following application of
light machine oil to prevent galling and damage to the gage.
These inspections, when performed to resolve controversy,
shall be conducted at the frequency specified in the quality
assurance provisions of ASME B18.2.6.

8. Workmanship

8.1 The allowable limits, inspection, and evaluation of the
surface discontinuities, quench cracks, forging cracks, head
bursts, shear bursts, seams, folds, thread laps, voids, tool
marks, nicks, and gouges shall be in accordance with Specifi-
cation F788/F788M.

9. Number of Tests and Retests

9.1 Testing Responsibility:

9.1.1 Each lot shall be tested by the manufacturer prior to
shipment in accordance with the lot identification control
quality assurance plan in 9.2 through 9.5.

9.1.2 When bolts are furnished by a source other than the
manufacturer, the Responsible Party as defined in 14 shall be
responsible for assuring all tests have been performed and the
bolts comply with the requirements of this specification (see
4.5).

9.2. Purpose of Lot Inspection—The purpose of a lot inspec-
tion program is to ensure that each lot conforms to the
requirements of this specification. For such a plan to be fully
effective it is essential that secondary processors, distributors,
