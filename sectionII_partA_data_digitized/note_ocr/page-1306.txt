4. Concerning Specification of Chemical Composition
Requirements

4.1 It is recommended that Guide E1282 be consulted as a
guide for specifying the chemical compositions for steels.

4.2 The recommended practice for specifying chemical
composition limits is to limit the number of significant figures
for each element so that the number of figures to the right of the
decimal point conforms to the following:

Maximum Number of
Chemical Concentration Figures to Right of Decimal Point

Up to 0.010 %, incl. 0.XXXX or may be expressed as ppm

Over 0.010 % to 0.10 %, incl O.XXX
Over 0.10 % to 3.0 %, incl O.XX,
Over 3.0 % 0.x

4.3 For those cases in which the composition range spans
either 0.10 or 3.0 %, the number of figures to the right of the
decimal is to be determined by that indicated by the upper
limit.

4.4 Technical considerations may dictate the employment of
less than the number of figures to the right of the decimal as
previously recommended.

Note 3—The recommendations should be employed to reduce the
number of significant figures, such as from 18.00 to 18.0%, but a
significant figure should never be added unless there is a technical reason
for so doing.

5. Cast or Heat Analysis

5.1 The producer shall perform analyses for those elements
specified in the material specification. The results of such
analyses shall conform to the requirements specified in the
material specification.

5.1.1 For multiple heats, either individual heat or cast
analysis, or an average heat or cast analysis, shall be reported.
If significant variations in heat or cast size are involved, a
weighted average heat or cast analysis, based on the relative
quantity of metal in each heat or cast, shall be reported.

5.1.2 For consumable electrode remelted material, a heat is
defined as all the ingots remelted by the same process from a
primary heat. The heat analysis shall be obtained from one
remelted ingot, or the product of one remelted ingot, from each
primary melt. If this heat analysis does not meet the heat
analysis requirements of the specification, one sample from the
product of each remelted ingot shall be analyzed, and the
analyses shall meet the heat analysis requirements.

5.2 If the test samples taken for the heat analysis are lost,
inadequate, or not representative of the heat, a product analysis
of the semifinished or finished product may be used to establish
the heat analysis.

5.2.1 If a product analysis is made to establish the heat
analysis, the product analysis shall meet the specified limits for
heat analysis and the product analysis tolerances described in
Section 6 do not apply.

5.3. Unless otherwise specified, compositions shall be
reported in mass fraction percent (wt%).

6. Product Analysis Requirements

6.1 For product analysis, the range of the specified chemical
composition is normally greater (designated product analysis

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025

tolerances) than that applicable to heat analyses to take into
account deviations associated with analytical reproducibility
and the heterogeneity of the steel. If several determinations of
any element in the heat are made, they may not vary both
above and below the specified range.

6.2 Product analysis tolerances may not be used to deter-
mine conformance to the specified heat or cast analysis unless
permitted by the individual material specification.

6.3 Product analysis tolerances, where available, are given
in the individual material specifications or in the general
requirement specifications.

7. Unspecified Elements (Note 4)
7.1 Reporting analyses of unspecified elements is permitted.

Nore 4—All commercial metals contain small amounts of various
elements in addition to those which are specified. It is neither practical nor
necessary to specify limits for every unspecified element that might be
present, despite the fact that the presence of many of these elements is
often routinely determined by the producer.

7.2 Analysis limits shall be established for specific elements

rather than groups of elements such as “all others,” “rare
earths,” and “balance.”

8. Sampling

8.1 Cast or Heat Analyses:

8.1.1 Samples shall be taken, insofar as possible, during the
casting of a heat, at a time which, in the producer’s judgment,
best represents the composition of the cast.

8.1.2 In case the heat analysis samples or analyses are lost
or inadequate, or when it is evident that the sample does not
truly represent the heat, representative samples may be taken
from the semifinished or finished product, in which case such
samples may be analyzed to satisfy the specified requirements.
The analysis shall meet the specified limits for heat analysis.

8.2 Check, Product, or Verification Analyses—Unless other-
wise specified, the latest revision of Practice E1806 shall be
used as a guide for sampling.

9. Test Methods

9.1 This section lists some test methods that have been
found acceptable for chemical analysis of steels.

9.1.1 The following ASTM wet chemical test methods have
been found acceptable as referee test methods and as a base for
standardizing instrumental analysis techniques.

Test Methods General Description

E350 Basic wet chemical procedure for steels.

E352 Wet chemical procedure for tool steels.

E353 Wet chemical procedure for stainless steels.

E354 Wet chemical procedure for high nickel steels.

E1019 Determination of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, and

hydrogen, in steel and in iron, nickel, and cobalt alloys,

9.1.2 The following ASTM instrumental test methods,
practices, and guides may be employed for chemical analysis
of steels or may be useful as a guide in the calibration and
standardization of instrumental equipment for routine sampling
and analysis of steels.
