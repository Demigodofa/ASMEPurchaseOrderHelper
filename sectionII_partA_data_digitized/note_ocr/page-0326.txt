INTERNATIONAL

Standard Specification for

ASME BPVC.ILA-2025

Seamless Medium-Carbon Steel Boiler and Superheater

Tubes’

This standard is issued under the fixed designation A210/A210M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision, A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.

1. Scope*

1.1 This specification” covers minimum-wall-thickness,
seamless medium-carbon steel, boiler tubes and boiler flues,
including safe ends (see Note 1), arch and stay tubes, and
superheater tubes.

Nore 1—This type is not suitable for safe ending by forge welding.

1.2 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to
this specification are ¥ in. to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside
diameter and 0.035 to 0.500 in. [0.9 to 12.7 mm], inclusive, in
minimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may
be furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other
requirements of this specification.

1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to
tubing smaller than % in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness.

1.4 This specification covers grades A-1 and C of Seamless
Medium-Carbon Boiler and Superheater Tubes with different
chemical and tensile requirements. (Table 1, Table 3, and
Section 11.)

1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi-
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the “M”
designation of this specification is specified in the order.

1.6 This international standard was developed in accor-
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

' This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO1 on Steel,
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee
01.09 on Carbon Steel Tubular Products.

Current edition approved May 1, 2019. Published May 2019. Originally
approved in 1938, Last previous edition approved in 2012 as A210/A210M - 02
(2012), DOK: 10.1520/A0210_A0210M-19.
