Standard Specification for

ASME BPVC.II.A-2025

Steel Castings, Creep-Strength Enhanced Ferritic Alloy, for
Pressure-Containing Parts, Suitable for High-Temperature

Service’

This standard is issued under the fixed designation A1091/A1091M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the
year of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last
reapproval. A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.

1. Scope*

1.1 This specification covers creep-strength enhanced alloy
steel castings for valves, flanges, fittings, and other pressure-
containing parts intended primarily for high-temperature ser-
vice (see Note 1). However, they are not restricted to such
applications and the castings may be used for other applica-
tions for which the attributes of the material, as defined by this
specification, are suitable.

1.2 Two grades of martensitic alloy steel, Grade C91 (UNS
No. J84090) and Grade C933 (UNS No. J84093), are covered.
Grade C91 is provided in two classes, differentiated by the type
of heat treatment after welding. Both grades, and similar steels,
are characterized by a predominantly tempered martensitic or
tempered bainitic microstructure that is stabilized by the
precipitation of temper-resistant particles at various precipitate
nucleation sites in the microstructure. Such steels are designed
to have creep-rupture strengths significantly superior to those
of alloys of nominally similar compositions, but in which the
precipitates or nucleation sites are absent. Since this crucial
difference cannot be revealed by room temperature mechanical
property tests, these alloys require tighter controls on manu-
facturing and processing.

Nore 1—The grades covered by this specification represent materials
that are generally suitable for assembly with other castings or wrought
steel parts by fusion welding. It is not intended to imply that these grades
possess equal degrees of weldability; therefore, it is the responsibility of
the purchaser to establish a suitable welding technique. Since these grades
possess varying degrees of suitability for high-temperature service, it is
also the responsibility of the purchaser to determine which grade shall be
furnished, due consideration being given to the requirements of the
applicable construction codes.

1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each

system shall be used independently of the other. Combining
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance
with the standard.

1.4 This international standard was developed in accor-
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
