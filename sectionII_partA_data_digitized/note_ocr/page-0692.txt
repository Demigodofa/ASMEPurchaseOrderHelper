subsequent exposure to sensitizing conditions in TP321,
TP321H, TP347, TP347H, TP348, and TP348H. When speci-
fied by the purchaser, a lower temperature stabilization or
re-solution anneal shall be used subsequent to the initial high
temperature solution anneal (see Supplementary Requirement
89).

5.4 The grain size of grades 304H, 316H, 321H, 347H, and

348H as determined in accordance with Test Methods E112,
shall be No. 7 or coarser.

6. Chemical Composition

6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1.

7. Product Analysis

7.1 At the request of the purchaser, an analysis of one billet
from each heat or two pipes from each lot shall be made by the
manufacturer. A lot of pipe shall consist of the number of
lengths as a function of size, as shown below, of the same size
and wall thickness from any one heat of steel:

NPS [DN] Designator Lengths of Pipe in Lot

Under NPS 2 [DN 50] 400 or fraction thereof
NPS 2 [DN 50] to NPS 5 200 or fraction thereof
[DN 125], incl

Over NPS 5 [DN 125] 100 or fraction thereof

7.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the
purchaser or the purchaser’s representative, and shall conform
to the requirements specified in Table 1.

7.3 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in Section 8
does not conform to the requirements specified in Section 6, an
analysis of each billet or pipe from the same heat or lot may be
made, and all billets or pipe conforming to the requirements
shall be accepted.

8. Tensile Requirements

8.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to
tensile properties prescribed in Table 2.

9. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance

9.1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient number
of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable assurance
that they have been properly evaluated with respect to depth.
Exploration of all surface imperfections is not required but may
be necessary to assure compliance with 9.2.

9.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 12/2 %
of the nominal wall thickness or encroach on the minimum
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with such
defects shall be given one of the following dispositions:

9.2.1 The defect may be removed by grinding provided that
the remaining wall thickness is within specified limits.

9.2.2 Repaired in accordance with the repair welding pro-
visions of 9.6.

9.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect may be cut
off within the limits of requirements on length.

9.2.4 Rejected.

9.3 To provide a workmanlike finish and basis for evaluat-
ing conformance with 9.2, the pipe manufacturer shall remove
by grinding the following:

For grade TP304, NPS8 or larger, and in schedules 140 and heavier, the required
minimum tensile strength shall be 70 ksi [480 MPa].

Prior to the issuance of A376/A376M — 88, the tensile and yield strength values
were 75 [520] and 30 [210] respectively, for nominal wall greater than 0.375 in.
[9.5 mm].

9.3.1 Mechanical marks, abrasions (see Note 3), and pits,
any of which imperfections are deeper than “ie in. [1.6 mm].

Note 3—Marks and abrasions are defined as cable marks, dinges, guide
marks, roll marks, ball scratches, scores, die marks, and so forth.

9.3.2 Visual imperfections commonly referred to as scabs,
seams, laps, tears, or slivers found by exploration in accor-
dance with 9.1 to be deeper than 5 % of the nominal wall
thickness.

9.4 At the purchaser’s discretion, pipe shall be subject to
rejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 9.2 are not
scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the
purchaser.

9.5 When imperfections or defects are removed by grinding,
a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the wall
thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by this
specification. The outside diameter at the point of grinding may
be reduced by the amount so removed.

9.5.1 Wall thickness measurements shall be made with a
mechanical caliper or with a properly calibrated nondestructive
testing device of appropriate accuracy. In case of dispute, the
measurement determined by use of the mechanical caliper shall
govern.

9.6 Weld repair shall be permitted only subject to the
approval of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification
A999/A999M.

9.7 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight.
9.8 The pipe shall be free of scale and contaminating iron
particles. Pickling, blasting, or surface finishing is not manda-

tory when pipe is bright annealed. The purchaser may request
that a passivating treatment be applied.
