7.3 See Supplementary Requirement S12 if a particular heat
treatment method is specified by the purchaser in the purchase
order.

74 Time of Heat Treatment—Heat treatment of the hot
isostatically-pressed parts shall be performed before or after
machining at the option of the manufacturer.

8. Structural Integrity Requirements

8.1 Microporosity:

8.1.1 The parts shall be free of microporosity as demon-
strated by measurement of density as provided in 8.1.2 or by
microstructural examination as provided in 8.1.3.

8.1.2 Density Measurement:

8.1.2.1 The density measurement shall be used for accep-
tance of material but not for rejection of material. The
measured density for each production lot shall exceed 99 % of
the density typical of that grade when wrought and in the same
heat treated condition as the sample. A production lot that fails
to meet this acceptance criterion is permitted, at the option of
the producer, to be tested for microporosity in accordance with
the microstructural examination as provided in 8.1.3.

8.1.2.2 Density shall be determined for one sample from
each production lot by measuring the difference in weight of
the sample when weighed in air and when weighed in water
and multiplying this difference by the density of water (Archi-
mede’s principle). The equipment used shall be capable of

determining density within +0.004 Ib/in.? [0.10 g/cm*].
Alternatively, at the option of the producer, it is permitted to
use Test Method B311 to determine the density.

8.1.2.3 At the option of the producer, the density shall be
compared to the room temperature density typical of wrought
alloy steels or to the density of a wrought reference sample of
the same grade heat treated in accordance with the require-
ments of Table 2 (see Note 2). The typical density for alloy
steel in the annealed condition at room temperature is 0.28
Ib/in.? [7.8 g/cm*].

Note 2—The actual density of alloy steel varies slightly with compo-
sition and heat treatment. For this reason, small differences in the
measured density from the typical density for a given grade of steel may
be the result of differences in alloy content, heat treatment, or micropo-
rosity. When density values are measured that are less than the density
typical of a given grade of steel, it is appropriate to examine the sample
for microporosity by the more specific metallographic examination
procedures.

8.1.3 Microstructural Examination:

8.1.3.1 The microstructure shall be examined at 20-50x,
100-200x, and 1000-2000x and shall be reasonably uniform
and shall be free of voids, laps, cracks, and porosity.

8.1.3.2 One sample from each production lot shall be
examined. The sample shall be taken from the component,
stem, protrusion, or test part made from a single powder blend
consolidated in the same hot isostatic press using the same
pressure, temperature, and time parameters and heat-treated in
