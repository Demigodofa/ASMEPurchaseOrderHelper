INTERNATIONAL

Standard Specification for

ASME BPVC.IL.A-2025

Seamless Ferritic Alloy-Steel Pipe for High-Temperature

Service’!

This standard is issued under the fixed designation A335/A335M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.

This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense.

1. Scope*

1.1 This specification® covers nominal wall and minimum
wall seamless ferritic alloy-steel pipe intended for high-
temperature service. Pipe ordered to this specification shall be
suitable for bending, flanging (vanstoning), and similar form-
ing operations, and for fusion welding. Selection will depend
upon design, service conditions, mechanical properties, and
high-temperature characteristics.

1.2 Several grades of ferritic steels (see Note 1) are covered.
Their compositions are given in Table 1.

Nore 1—Ferritic steels in this specification are defined as low- and
intermediate-alloy steels containing up to and including 10 % chromium.

1.3 Supplementary requirements (S1 to S9) of an optional
nature are provided. Supplementary requirements S1 through
S6 call for additional tests to be made, and when desired, shall
be so stated in the order together with the number of such tests
required as applicable.

1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the “M”
designation of this specification is specified in the order.

Nore 2—The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as “nominal
diameter,” “size,” and “nominal size.”

' This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AOI on Steel,
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee
A01.10 on Stainless and Alloy Steel Tubular Products.

1.5 This international standard was developed in accor-
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
