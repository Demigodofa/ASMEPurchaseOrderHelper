1. Scope*

1.1 This specification covers the general requirements for
steel sheet in coils and cut lengths. It applies to the following
specifications that describe carbon steel, structural steel, and
high-strength, low-alloy steel (HSLA) furnished as hot-rolled
sheet and cold-rolled sheet: Specifications A414/A414M,
A424/A424M, A606/A606M, A659/A659M, A794/A794M,
A1008/A1008M, A1011/A1011M, and A1039/A1039M.

1.2 This specification is not applicable to hot-rolled heavy-
thickness carbon sheet coils (Specification A635/A635M).

1.3 In case of any conflict in requirements, the requirements
of the individual material specification shall prevail over those
of this general specification.

1.4 For the purposes of determining conformance with this
and the appropriate product specification referenced in 1.1,
measured values, calculated values, or observed values shall be
rounded to the nearest unit in the right hand place of figures
used in expressing the limiting values in accordance with the
rounding method of Practice E29.

1.4.1 Ordered values, identified in tables, specified such as
over 30 through 48 or 30 exclusive to 48 inclusive, covers all
ordered values specified as 30.1, 30.01, 30.001, etc., up to and
including 48.000 etc., but does not cover ordered values
specified as 30.000 etc., or less, nor does it cover ordered
values specified as 48.1, 48.01, 48.001, etc.

1.5 Annex A1 lists permissible variations in dimensions and
mass (see Note 1) in SI [metric] units. The values listed are not
exact conversions of the values listed in the inch-pound tables,
but instead are rounded or rationalized values. Conformance to
Annex A1 is mandatory when the “M” specification is used.

Nore 1—The term weight is used when inch-pound units are the

Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee
A01.19 on Steel Sheet and Strip.

standard. However, under SI the preferred term is mass.

1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance
with the standard.

1.7 This specification and the applicable material specifica-
tions are expressed in both inch-pound units and SI units.
However, unless the order specifies the applicable “M” speci-
fication designation (SI units), the material shall be furnished
to inch-pound units.

1.8 This international standard was developed in accor-
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
