SA-335/SA-335M (ASTM A335/A335M)

Alternatively, in lieu of this ratio minimum, the material shall have a minimum hardness of 275 HV in the hardened condition, defined as after austenitizing and cooling
to room temperature but prior to tempering. Hardness testing shall be performed at mid-thickness of the product. Hardness test frequency shall be two samples of product
per heat treatment lot and the hardness testing results shall be reported on the material test report.

Applies to both heat and product analyses.

=Chromium-Nickel Balance is defined as CNB = (Cr + 6Si + 4Mo + 1.5W + 11V + 5Nb + 9Ti + 12Al) — (40C + 30N + 4Ni + 2Mn + 1CU).
The terms Niobium (Nb) and Columbium (Cb) are alternate names for the same element.

specification. See the Sections on Hydrostatic Test Require-
ments and Permissible Variation in Weight for Seamless Pipe in
Specification A999/A999M),

3.1.9 Specification designation, and

3.1.10 Special requirements or any supplementary require-
ments selected, or both.

3.1.11 The flattening or bend test shall be performed on 5 %
of the pipe (or fewer in accordance with 14.2) unless Supple-
mentary Requirement S3 is specified.

4. General Requirements

4.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to
the applicable requirements of the current edition of Specifi-
cation A999/A999M, unless otherwise provided herein.

5. Materials and Manufacture

5.1 Pipe may be either hot finished or cold drawn with the
finishing treatment as required in 5.2.

Nore 3—It is recommended that the temperature for tempering should
be at least 100 °F [50 °C] above the intended service temperature;
consequently, the purchaser should advise the manufacturer if the service
temperature is to be over 1100 °F [600 °C].

Nots 4—Certain of the ferritic steels covered by this specification will
harden if cooled rapidly from above their critical temperature. Some will
air harden, that is, become hardened to an undesirable degree when cooled
in air from high temperatures. Therefore, operations involving heating
such steels above their critical temperatures, such as welding, flanging,
and hot bending, should be followed by suitable heat treatment.

6. Chemical Composition

6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1.

7. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance

7.1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient number
of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable assurance
that they have been properly evaluated with respect to depth.
Exploration of all surface imperfections is not required but may
be necessary to ensure compliance with 7.2.

7.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 1212 %
of the nominal wall thickness or encroach on the minimum
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with such
defects shall be given one of the following dispositions:

7.2.1 The defect may be removed by grinding provided that
the remaining wall thickness is within specified limits.

7.2.2. Repaired in accordance with the repair welding pro-
visions of 7.6.

7.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect may be cut
off within the limits of requirements on length.

7.2.4 Rejected.

7.3 To provide a workmanlike finish and basis for evaluat-
ing conformance with 7.2, the pipe manufacturer shall remove
by grinding the following:

7.3.1 Mechanical marks, abrasions (see Note 5) and pits,
any of which imperfections are deeper than 1c in. [1.6 mm].

Nore 5—Marks and abrasions are defined as cable marks, dinges, guide
marks, roll marks, ball scratches, scores, die marks, and the like.

7.3.2 Visual imperfections, commonly referred to as scabs,
seams, laps, tears, or slivers, found by exploration in accor-
dance with 7.1 to be deeper than 5% of the nominal wall
thickness.

7.4 At the purchaser’s discretion, pipe shall be subject to
rejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 7.2 are not
scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the
purchaser.

7.5 When imperfections or defects are removed by grinding,
a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the wall
thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by this
