Note 1—Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than % in. from a cut edge and not less than 1 in. from a mill edge. This table .
does not apply to the uncropped ends of mill edge coils. /
Nore 2—Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in. :
[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm].
Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements. :
Nore 3—The thickness of material <2 in. wide shall be measured at mid-width. ; ;

A The specified thickness range captions apply independent of whether the ordered thickness is stated as a nominal or minimum. :
8 The tolerances provided in the table are based on minimum thickness (tolerance over, no tolerance under). For nominal thickness, the tolerance is divided equally over
and under.
