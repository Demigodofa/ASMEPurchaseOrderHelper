Note 1—The grades covered by this specification represent materials ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section I
that are generally suitable for assembly with other castings or wrought ASME Boil dP Vessel Code Section III :
steel parts by fusion welding. It is not intended to imply that these grades Ol er and Fressure Vessel ode ection .
possess equal degrees of weldability; therefore, it is the responsibility of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section IV |
the purchaser to establish a suitable welding technique. Since these grades ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII
possess varying degrees of suitability for high-temperature service, it is ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section IX —
also the responsibility of the purchaser to determine which grade shall be ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section XII
furnished, due consideration being given to the requirements of the A 7
applicable construction codes. 2.4 Other ASME Codes: .
