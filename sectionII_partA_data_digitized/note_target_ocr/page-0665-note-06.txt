Note 6——Specimens with sides parallel throughout their length are permitted, except for referee testing, provided: (a) the above tolerances are used;
(b) an adequate number of marks are provided for determination of elongation; and (c) when yield strength is determined, a suitable extensometer is used.
If the fracture occurs at a distance of less than 2A from the edge of the gripping device, the tensile properties determined may not be representative of
the material. If the properties meet the minimum requirements specified, no further testing is required, but if they are less than the minimum requirements,
discard the test and retest.
