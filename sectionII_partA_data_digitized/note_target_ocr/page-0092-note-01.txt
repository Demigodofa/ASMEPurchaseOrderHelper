Note 1—Waviness denotes the maximum deviation of the surface of
the plate from a plane parallel to the surface of the point of measurement
and contiguous to the surface of the place at each of the two adjacent wave
peaks, when the plate is resting on a flat horizontal surface, as measured :
in an increment of less than 4000 mm of length. The permitted variation
in waviness is a function of the permitted variation from a flat surface as
obtained from Table A1.13 or Table A1.14, whichever is applicable.
