Note 2—Thin-wall pipe usually develops significant ovality (out-of- pipe made of ferritic stainless steels may be up to about 5 % less, and that
roundness) during final annealing, straightening, or both. The diameter made of austenitic stainless steel up to about 2 % greater, than the values

tolerances given in Table | are usually not sufficient to provide for given.
