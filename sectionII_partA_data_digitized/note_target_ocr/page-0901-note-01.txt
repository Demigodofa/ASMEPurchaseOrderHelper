Note 1—Tolerances in this table apply to any length, not necessarily :
the rolling direction, up to 36 in. [914 mm] and to any 36 in. [914 mm] of
longer lengths in the plane of the plate measured while the plate rests on -
a flat surface with the concavity of the curvature upward. :

Notre 2—If the longer dimension is under 36 in. [914 mm], the
tolerance is not greater than % in. [6.4 mm].
