- Note 1—The following equation, upon which this table is based, may be applied to calculate minimum wall thickness from nominal (average) wall ‘ :
thickness:
t, x 0.875 = t,, :
where: :
t, = nominal (average) wall thickness, in. [mm], and
t,, = minimum wall thicknesses, in. [mm],
The wall thickness in inch-pound units is rounded to three decimal places in accordance with the rounding method of Practice E29. The wall thickness a
in SI units is rounded to one decimal place in accordance with the rounding method of Practice E29. ;
