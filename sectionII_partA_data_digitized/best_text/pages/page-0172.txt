SA-31 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR STEEL RIVETS AND BARS FOR 
RIVETS, PRESSURE VESSELS 
SA-31 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers steel rivets for use in 
boilers and pressure vessels and steel bars for use in the 
manufacture of rivets. 
1.2 Two grades are covered: 
1~2.1 Grade A - Bars having a yield point of 
23 000 psi (160 MPa) minimum with no controls on carbon 
content. 
1.2.2 Grade B - Bars having a yield point of 
29 000 psi (200 MPa) minimum with carbon 0.28% 
maximum. 
1.2.3 Rivets are manufactured from the applicable 
bar grade. 
1.3 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be 
regarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses 
are for information only.

4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel shall be made by any of the following 
processes: open-hearth, electric-furnace, or basic-oxygen. 
4.2 Rivets shall be manufactured from rivet bars con­
forming to the applicable grade ordered. 
4.3 Rivets shall be manufactured by hot- or cold­
heading. 
4.4 Bars shall be furnished as rolled and not pickled, 
blast cleaned, or oiled. At producer's option, bars may be 
cleaned for inspection or cold drawn. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 The steel shall conform to chemical composition 
prescribed in Table l.
