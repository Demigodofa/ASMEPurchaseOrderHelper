ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-541/SA-541M 
specified by the purchaser in accordance with 6.2. How­
ever, since the drop-weight specimen can be taken in any 
orientation, the fracture plane of the specimen when tested 
to Method 2 (6.2.2) shall be a minimum distance of ]fo in. 
[11 mm] from the nearest quenched surface, and 1½ in. 
[40 mm] from any second surface. The purchaser may 
specify either duplicate no-break performance when tested 
10° warmer than a specified temperature or request a deter­
mination of the nil-ductility temperature. 
SS. Restrictive Chemistry for Grades 4N and 5 
SS.1 Phosphorus and sulfur limits for Grades 4N and 
5 may be specified 0.020%, max. 
S9. Additional Vanadium 
S9.1 For Grade 5 forgings, 0.05 to 0.15% vanadium 
may be specified. 
Sl0. Special Steels 
Sl0.1 Vacuum treated steel shall be specified. 
Sl0.2 When Grades 2, 3, 4N, and 5 are vacuum carbon 
deoxidized, the silicon content shall be 0.10% maximum. 
Sl0.3 The test report shall indicate that the steel was 
vacuum carbon deoxidized. 
SU. Rings and Hollow Cylindrically Shaped Parts 
SU.1 Tests shall be removed in the tangential (circum­
ferential) direction regardless of direction of maximum 
working. 
S12. Restrictive Chemistry 
S12.1 The following restricted phosphorus and copper 
limits may be specified as follows: 
P 0.012% max heat, 0.015% max product; Cu 0.10% 
max 
P 0.015% max heat, 0.018% max product; Cu 0.15% 
max 
S13. Alternative Fracture Toughness Requirements 
S13.1 The fracture toughness requirements (drop­
weight or Charpy impact tests, or both) for materials of 
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, 
Article NB-2300, NC-2300, ND-2300, NE-2300, NF-2300 
or NG-2300, as specified, shall be used instead of the 
Charpy impact test requirements of this specification. 
S14. Alternative Test Specimen Orientation 
S14.1 The longitudinal axis of all test specimens shall 
be oriented in a direction transverse to the direction of 
maximum working of the forging. 
S15. Restricted Sulfur Content 
S15.1 The sulfur content shall be limited to 0.015% 
maximum heat and 0.018% maximum product.
