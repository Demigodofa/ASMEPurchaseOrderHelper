TABLE A3.20 Permitted Variations in Flatness of Plate Mill Plate 
(Quarto Plate) 
NOTE 1-Tolerances in this table apply to any length, not necessarily 
the rolling direction, up to 36 in. [914 mm] and to any 36 in. [914 mm] of 
longer lengths in the plane of the plate measured while the plate rests on 
a flat surface with the concavity of the curvature upward. 
NOTE 2-If the longer dimension is under 36 in. [914 mm], the 
tolerance is not greater than ¼ in. [6.4 mm]. 
NoTE 3-For plates with specified minimum yield strengths of 35 ksi 
[240 MPa] or more, the permitted variations are increased to 1 ½ times the 
amounts shown. 
NoTE 4-For specified thicknesses other than those shown, the toler­
ances for the next higher thickness shall apply.

TABLE A3.21 Cold-rolled Products, Processed Without Coiling 
Tolerances for cold-rolled products processed without coiling shall be identical 
to the tolerances for hot-rolled products processed without coiling as listed in 
Table A3.17, unless otherwise agreed upon by seller and purchaser and 
specified in the purchase order.
