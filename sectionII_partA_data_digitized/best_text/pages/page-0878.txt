SA-4 79 /SA-4 79M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Stainless Steel Bars and Shapes for Use in Boilers and 
Other Pressure Vessels 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers hot- and cold-finished bars of 
stainless steel, including rounds, squares, and hexagons, and 
hot-rolled or extruded shapes such as angles, tees, and channels 
for use in boiler and pressure vessel construction. 2 
Nom 1-There are standards covering high nickel, chromium, auste­
nitic corrosion, and heat-resisting alloy materials. These standards are 
under the jurisdiction of ASTM Subcommittee B02.07 and may be found 
in Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol 02.04. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.3 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch­
pound units. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
