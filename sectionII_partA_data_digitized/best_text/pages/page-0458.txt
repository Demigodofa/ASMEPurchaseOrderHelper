(either air under water or pneumatic leak test) in accordance 
with Specification A1016/A1016M. 
S2. Additional Testing of Welded Tubing for 100 % Joint 
Efficiency in Certain ASME Applications (see Note 
S2.1) 
NoTE S2.1-When specified, the special testing in this supplement is 
intended for special ASME applications. It is not mandatory for all ASME 
applications. 
S2.1 Where this supplement is specified in the purchase
