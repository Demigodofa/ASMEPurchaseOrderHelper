SA-541/SA-541M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
forgings that it represents, except that a longitudinally 
forged bar may be used to represent a rolled ring of similar 
cross section. It shall be of the same nominal thickness as 
the as-quenched production forgings and shall be heat 
treated in the same furnace charge and under the same 
conditions as the production forgings. Test specimens shall 
be removed using the ¾ T by T procedure referenced in 
Method 3 with the same limitation on forging thickness 
as in 6.2.3. This method shall be limited to forgings with a 
rough machined weight of not more than 1 000 lb [ 450 kg]. 
6.3 Metal Buffers - The required distances from 
quenched surfaces may be obtained with metal buffers 
instead of integral extensions. Buffer material may be car­
bon or low-alloy steel, and shall be joined to the forging 
with a partial penetration weld that seals the buffered sur­
face. Specimens shall be located at least ½. in. [13 mm] 
from the buffered surface of the forging. Buffers shall be 
removed and the welded areas subjected to magnetic parti­
cle test to ensure freedom from cracks unless the welded 
areas are completely removed by subsequent machining. 
6.4 Samples shall be removed from forgings after the 
quenching and tempering heat treatments. This sample 
material shall be subjected to a simulated post-weld heat 
treatment if Supplementary Requirement Sl is specified. 
6.5 Orientation - For upset disk forgings, the longitu­
dinal axis of all test specimens shall be oriented in the 
tangential direction. For all other forgings, the longitudinal 
axis of the specimens shall be oriented in the direction of 
maximum working of the forging unless Supplementary 
Requirements S 11 or S 14 are imposed. 
6.6 Number of Tests: 
6.6.1 Forgings under 500 lb [230 kg] As Treated -
6.6.3 Each forging weighing over 10 000 lb 
[ 4500 kg] shall require two tension tests and two impact 
tests, located at opposite ends if the length is 1 ½. times the 
diameter or more, or 180° apart otherwise. 
7. Repair Welding 
7.1 Repair welding of forgings may be permitted, but 
only at the option of the purchaser. 
7 .2 If repair welding is pe1formed, welders and weld 
procedures shall be qualified in accordance with Section 
IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
8. Workmanship and Quality Level Requirements 
8.1 Dimensional and visual inspections shall be con­
ducted by the manufacturer. Forgings shall be free of 
cracks, thermal ruptures, or other imperfections. 
9. Certification and Reports 
9.1 In addition to items required to be reported by 
Specification A 788, the following items shall also be 
reported: 
9.1.1 Product chemical analysis. 
9.1.2 The method used for locating test specimens. 
9.1.3 Sketches included in the report of non-destruc-
tive examinations. 
9.1.4 Details of the heat treatment cycle, as listed in 
Specification A 788. 
For duplicate forgings weighing less than 500 lb [230 kg] 10. Product Marking 
as treated, one tension test and one impact test (three speci- 10.1 The purchaser may specify additional identifica-
mens) shall be made to represent each heat in each heat- tion marking and the location of the marking. If stamps

continuous-type furnaces with suitable temperature control die stamps having a minimum radius of ½ 2 in. [0.8 mm]. 
and equipped with recording pyrometers so that complete 
heat-treatment records are available, a heat-treatment 
charge shall be considered as any continuous run not 
exceeding an 8 h duration. 
6.6.2 Forgings weighing 500 to JO 000 lb [230 to 
4500 kg] As-Heat Treated - One tension and one impact 
test (3 specimens) shall be made for each forging.
