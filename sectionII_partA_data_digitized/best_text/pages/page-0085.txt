taken from a location representing the top of an ingot or part of 
an ingot used to produce the product represented by such 
specimens. 
S31. Maximum Carbon Equivalent for Weldability 
S31.1 Plates and shapes shall be supplied with a specific 
maximum carbon equivalent value as specified by the pur­
chaser. This value shall be based upon heat analysis. The 
required chemical analysis as well as the carbon equivalent 
shall be reported. 
S31.2 The carbon equivalent shall be calculated using the 
following formula: 
CE= C+Mn/6+(Cr+Mo+V)/5+(Ni+Cu)/15 
S31.3 For additional information on the weldability of steel, 
see Appendix X3. 
S32. Single Heat Bundles 
S32.1 Bundles containing shapes or bars shall be from a 
single heat of steel.
