TABLE A1.16 Permitted Variations in Cross Section for W, HP, S, M, C, and MC Shapes 
NoTE 1-A is measured at center lines of web for S, M, W, and HP shapes; at back of web for C and MC shapes. Measurement is overall for C shapes 
under 75 mm. B is measured parallel to flange. C is measured parallel to web. 
NOTE 2-Wbere " ... " appears in this table, there is no requirement.

A T + T applies when flanges of channels are toed in or out. For channels 16 mm and under in depth, the permitted out-of-square is 0.05 mm/mm of depth. The permitted 
variation shall be rounded to the nearest millimetre after calculation. 
8 Permitted variation is per millimetre of flange width for S, M, C, and MC shapes. 
c Permitted variation of 8 mm max for sections over 634 kg/m.
