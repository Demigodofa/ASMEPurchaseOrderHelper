SA-401/SA-401M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
7.2.2 Location of Tests-It shall be permissible to take test 
specimens from either end of the coil. 
7.2.3 Test Method-The tension test shall be made in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. For 
shaped wires, cross sectional area shall be calculated either by 
using the procedure in Test Methods E8/E8M for uniform but 
nonsymmetrical cross-sections, or by measuring width and 
thickness and multiplying by a shape factor. Reduction of area 
for shaped wires shall be calculated by using this shape factor. 
Measure the maximum and minimum dimension on the necked 
down section and multiply by the shape factor to estimate the 
cross sectional area for use in the standard reduction of area 
calculation. 
7.2.4 Upon agreement between purchaser and supplier, the 
shape factor for the cross section design provided by the wire 
mill shall be permissible to be adopted for use. In other 
situations, if the shape factor is not available from the wire 
mill, the shape factor shall be calculated by measuring the 
cross sectional area in accordance with Test Methods E8/E8M 
and dividing by the width and thiclmess. 
7.3 Wrap Test: 
7.3.1 Quench and tempered or cold drawn wire 4.00 mm 
[0.157 in.] and smaller in diameter shall wind on itself as an 
arbor without breakage. Larger diameter wire up to and 
including 8.00 mm [0.315 in.] in diameter shall wrap without 
breakage on a mandrel twice the wire diameter. The wrap test 
is not applicable to wire over 8.00 mm [0.315 in.] in diameter 
or to shaped and flat rolled wires. 
7.3.2 Number of Tests-One test specimen shall be taken for 
each 10 coils, or fraction thereof, in a lot. Each heat in a given 
lot shall be tested. 
7.3.3 Location of Test-It shall be permissible to take test 
specimens from either end of the coil. 
7.3.4 Test Method-The wrap test shall be made in accor­
dance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
8. Metallurgical Requirements 
8.1 Surface Condition: 
8.1.1 On the whole, the surface of the wire as received shall 
be free of rust and excessive scale. Based upon examination of 
end specimens, no serious die marks, scratches, or other 
continuous surface imperfections shall be present. Based upon 
examination of etched-end specimen, seams shall not exceed 
3.5 % of the wire diameter, or 0.25 mm [0.010 in.], whichever 
is the smaller as measured on a transverse section. 
8.1.2 Number of Tests-For the purpose of examination of 
etched-end specimens, one test specimen shall be taken for 
each 10 coils, or fraction thereof, in a lot. Each cast or heat in 
a given lot shall be tested. 
8.1.3 Location of Test-Test specimens shall be taken from 
either or both ends of the coil. 
8.1.4 Test Method-The surface shall be examined after 
etching in a solution of equal parts of hydrochloric acid and 
water that has been heated to approximately 80°C for up to two 
minutes in order to remove the oxide scale layer from the wire 
surface. Test ends shall be examined using lOx magnification. 
Any specimens showing the presence of a questionable surface 
imperfection shall have a transverse section taken from the 
670 
unetched area, properly mounted and polished and examined to 
measure the depth of the smface imperfection. 
8.2 Decarburization: 
8.2.1 The depth of complete decarburization (free ferrite) 
shall not exceed 0.75 % of the equivalent round wire diameter. 
The total affected depth (free ferrite plus partial decarburiza­
tion) shall not exceed 2.0 % of the equivalent round wire 
diameter on all sizes of wire. 
8.2.2 Test Method-Decarburization shall be determined by 
etching a suitably polished transverse section of wire with 
nital. The entire periphery to be examined should be in a single 
plane with no edge rounding. 
8.2.3 The entire periphery shall be examined at a magnifi­
cation of no less than lO0x for depth of free ferrite and total 
affected depth. Smaller wire sizes may require higher magni­
fication. Measure the worst area present excluding decarbur­
ization associated with any surface imperfections. Complete 
decarburization exists when only free ferrite is present. Partial 
decarburization exists when ferrite is found mixed with pearlite 
or tempered martensite. Structures of 100 % tempered marten­
site shall be defined as not decarburized. 
8.2.4 Decarburization shall be checked on annealed wire by 
giving a wire sample an austenitize, oil quench and temper heat 
treatment. A flat shall be ground on the test sample prior to heat 
treatment. The flat shall have a minimum width equal to one 
half of the wire diameter. Any decarburization visible on this 
ground section shall necessitate a retest with new samples. If 
no decarburization is visible on the ground flat, evaluate the 
complete wire section in accordance with 8.2.3. 
9. Dimensions and Permissible Variations 
9 .1 The permissible variations in the diameter of the wire 
shall be as specified in Table 3. Any definition of shaped 
tolerances shall be agreed upon by the producer and the 
purchaser. 
10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
10.1 Annealed and Cold Drawn-The wire shall not be 
kinked or improperly cast. To test for cast, a few convolutions 
of wire shall be cut loose from the coil and placed on a flat
