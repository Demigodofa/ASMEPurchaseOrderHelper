SA-671/SA-671M (ASTM A671/A671M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
11. Dimensions, Mass and Permissible Variations 
11.1 The wall thickness and weight for welded pipe fur­
nished to this specification shall be governed by the require­
ments of the specification to which the manufacturer ordered 
the plate. 
11.2 Permissible variations in dimensions at any point in a 
length of pipe shall not exceed the following: 
11.2.1 Outside Diameter-Based on circumferential mea­
surement ± 0.5 % of the specified outside diameter. 
11.2.2 Out-of-Roundness-Difference between major and 
minor outside diameters, 1 %. 
11.2.3 Alignment-Using a 10-ft [3-m] straight edge placed 
so that both ends are in contact with the pipe, 1/s in. [3 mm]. 
11.2.4 Thickness-The minimum wall thickness at any point 
in the pipe shall not be more than 0.01 in. [0.3 mm] under the 
specified nominal thickness. 
11.3 Circumferential welded joints of the same quality as 
the longitudinal joints shall be permitted by agreement between 
the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
11.4 Lengths with unmachined ends shall be within -0, +½ 
in. [-0, + 13 mm] of that specified. Lengths with machined ends 
shall be as agreed between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The finished pipe shall be free of injurious defects and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. This requirement is to mean 
the same as the identical requirement that appears in Specifi­
cation A20/ A20M with respect to steel plate surface finish. 
13. Product Marking 
13.1 In addition to the marking provision of Specification 
A530/A530M, class marking in accordance with 1.3.3 shall 
follow the grade marking, for example, CC 70-10. 
13.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 13.1, 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall be applied only when specified by 
the purchaser in the inquiry, contract, or order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be 
agreed upon in writing by the manufacturer and purchaser. Supplementary requirements shall in no 
way negate any requirement of the specification itself. 
Sl. Tension and Bend Tests 
Sl.1 Tension tests in accordance with 8.1 and bend tests in 
accordance with 8.2 shall be made on specimens representing 
each length of pipe. 
S2. Charpy V-Notch Test 
S2.1 Requirements-The acceptable test energies for mate­
rial shown in Specification A20/ A20M shall conform to the 
energy values shown in Specification A20/ A20M. 
S2. l .1 Materials not listed in Specification A20/ A20M shall 
be in accordance with the purchase order requirements. 
S2.2 Number of Specimens-Each test shall consist of at 
least three specimens. 
S2.2.1 One base metal test shall be made from one pipe 
length per heat per heat-treat charge per nominal wall thick­
ness. For pipe from Classes 10, 11, 12, and 13, one base metal 
test shall be made per heat per size and per wall thickness. 
S2.2.2 One weld-metal test shall be made in accordance 
with UG-84 of Section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code. 
S2.2.3 One heat-affected-zone test shall be made in accor­
dance with UG-84 of Section VIII of the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code. 
S2.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation: 
S2.3.1 Specimens for base-metal tests in Grades CA, CB, 
and CC in the as rolled stress relieved or normalized condition 
(classes of the 10, 20, 30, and 40 series) shall be taken so that 
the longitudinal axis of the specimen is parallel to the longi­
tudinal axis of the pipe. 
S2.3.2 Base-metal specimens of quench and tempered pipe, 
when the quenching and tempering follows the welding 
operation, shall be taken in accordance with the provision of 
N330 of Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code. 
S2.4 Test Method-The specimen shall be Charpy-V Type A 
in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. The 
specimens shall be tested in accordance with Test Methods and 
Definitions A370. Unless otherwise indicated by the purchaser, 
the test temperature shall be as given in Specification A20/ 
A20M for those base materials covered by Specification 
A20/A20M. For materials not covered by Specification A20/ 
A20M the test temperature shall be 10 °F [-12 °C] unless 
otherwise stated in the purchase order. 
S3. Hardness Test 
S3.1 Hardness tests shall be made in accordance with Test 
Methods and Definitions A370 or Test Method Ell0 across the 
welded joint of both ends of each length of pipe. In addition, 
hardness tests shall be made to include the heat-affected zone
