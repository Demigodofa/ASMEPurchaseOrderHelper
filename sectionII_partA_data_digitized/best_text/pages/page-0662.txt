Al.2 Orientation of Test Specimens Al.3.2 Alloy Steel Bars-Alloy steel bars are usually not 
tested in the as-rolled condition. Al.2.1 Carbon and alloy steel bars and bar-size shapes, due 
to their relatively small cross-sectional dimensions, are cus­
tomaiily tested in the longitudinal direction. In special cases 
where size permits and the fab1ication or service of a part 
justifies testing in a transverse direction, the selection and 
location of test or tests are a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
Al.3.3 When tension tests are specified, the practice for 
selecting test specimens for hot-rolled and cold-finished steel 
bars of vaiious sizes shall be in accordance with Table Al.I, 
unless otherwise specified in the product specification. 
Al.4 Bend Test 
Al.3 Tension Test 
Al.3.1 Carbon Steel Bars-Carbon steel bars are not com­
monly specified to tensile requirements in the as-rolled condi­
tion for sizes of rounds, squares, hexagons, and octagons under 
½ in. (13 mm) in diameter or distance between parallel faces 
nor for other bar-size sections, other than flats, less than 1 in.2 
(645 mm 2 ) in cross-sectional area. 
Al.4.1 When bend tests are specified, the recommended 
practice for hot-rolled and cold-finished steel bars shall be in 
accordance with Table Al.2. 
Al.5 Hardness Test 
Al.5.1 Hardness Tests on Bar Products (flats, rounds, 
squares, hexagons, and octagons) are conducted on the surface 
after a minimum removal of 0.015 in. to provide for accurate 
TABLE A1.1 Practices for Selecting Tension Test Specimens for Steel Bar Products 
Nam 1-For bar sections where it is difficult to determine the cross-sectional area by simple measurement, the area in square inches may be calculated 
by dividing the weight per linear inch of specimen in pounds by 0.2833 (weight of 1 in.3 of steel) or by dividing the weight per linear foot of specimen 
by 3.4 (weight of steel 1 in. sqnare and 1 ft long).
