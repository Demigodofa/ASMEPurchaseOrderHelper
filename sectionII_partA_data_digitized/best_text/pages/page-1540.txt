SA-999 /SA-999M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
General Requirements for Alloy and Stainless Steel Pipe 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers a group of general require­
ments that, unless otherwise specified in an individual 
specification, shall apply to the ASTM product specifications 
noted below. 
1.2 In the case of conflict between a requirement of a 
product specification and a requirement of this specification, 
the product specification shall prevail. In the case of conflict 
between a requirement of the product specification or a 
requirement of this specification and a more stringent require­
ment of the purchase order, the purchase order shall prevail.

1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units apply unless the "M" designa­
tion (SI) of the product specification is specified in the order. 
NoTE 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) is used 
in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal diameter," "size," 
"nominal bore," and "nominal size." 
1.4 The following precautionary statement pertains only to 
the test method portion, Section 22, of this specification: This 
standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, 
if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user 
of this standard to establish appropriate safety, health, and 
environmental practices and determine the applicability of 
regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
