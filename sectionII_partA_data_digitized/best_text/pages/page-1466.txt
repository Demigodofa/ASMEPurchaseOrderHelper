SA-961/SA-961M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
product analysis (check analysis) tolerances are not to be 
applied to the heat analysis requirements. 
S52. Product Analysis 
S52.1 A product analysis shall be made from one randomly 
selected forging representing each heat. The results shall 
comply with the product analysis limits listed in the applicable 
product specification. For Specification Al82/A182M grades 
of F20 and F58, results shall comply with the product analysis 
limits listed in Specification B880. 
S52.2 If the analysis fails to comply, each forging shall be 
checked or the lot rejected. All results shall be reported to the 
purchaser. 
S53. Tension Tests 
S53.1 In addition to the requirements of Section 9, one 
tension specimen shall be obtained from a representative 
forging from each heat at a location agreed upon between the 
certifying organization and the purchaser. The results of the test 
shall comply with the tensile property requirements listed in 
the applicable product specification and shall be reported to the 
purchaser. 
S54. Impact Tests 
S54.1 In addition to the requirements of Section 9, three 
CVN impact energy specimens shall be obtained from a 
representative forging from each heat at a location agreed upon 
between the certifying organization and the purchaser. 
S54.2 The purchaser shall supply the impact test tempera­
ture and the required minimum requirements for the test, 
including the lowest single absorbed energy for a single 
specimen if an average absorbed energy value is required. The 
lateral expansion values and the fracture appearance of the 
specipiens as percentage ductile fracture shall be reported for 
information if these parameters are not part of the acceptance 
requirements. 
SSS. Magnetic Particle Examination 
S55.1 All accessible surfaces of the finished forging shall be 
examined by a magnetic particle method. The method shall be 
in accordance with Test Method A275/A275M. Acceptance 
limits shall be as agreed upon between the certifying organic 
zation and the purchaser. 
S56. Liquid Penetrant Examination 
S56.1 All accessible surfaces shall be examined by a liquid 
penetrant method in accordance with Test Method E165/ 
E165M. Acceptance limits shall be as agreed upon between the 
certifying organization and the purchaser. 
S57. Hydrostatic Testing 
S57.1 A hydrostatic test at a pressure agreed upon between 
the certifying organization and the purchaser shall be applied 
by the certifying organization. 
SSS. Repair Welding 
S58.1 No repair welding shall be permitted without prior 
approval of the purchaser. If permitted, the restrictions of 
Section 16 shall apply. 
S59. Electropolished Austenitic and Ferritic-Austenitic 
Grades 
S59.l All electropolished austenitic and ferritic-austenitic 
products shall be of a cleanliness in accordance with Specifi­
cation A967 / A967M. 
S59.2 Details concerning which test method of Specifica­
tion A967 / A967M are to be a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
S60. Positive Material Identification Examination 
S60.1 Forgings shall receive positive material identification 
to ensure that the purchaser is receiving forgings of the correct 
material grade prior to shipment of the forgings. This exami­
nation is a method to ensure that no material grade mix-up has 
occurred during the manufacturing and marking of the forg­
ings. 
S60.2 Forgings shall receive a positive material identifica­
tion examination in accordance with Guide B1916. 
S60.3 The quantity examined shall be 100 % of the forg­
ings. 
S60.4 All forgings that are not of the correct material grade 
shall be rejected. 
S60.5 The method of forging marking after examination 
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
S61. Heat Treatment in the Working Zone of a Surveyed 
Furnace 
S61.1 Material shall be heat treated in the working zone of 
a furnace that has been surveyed in accordance with Test 
Method A991/A991M, provided that such working zone was 
established using a variation of 25 °F [14 °C] or less from the 
furnace set point. 
S61.2 The test report shall indicate that S61 applies. 
S62. Requirements for Carbon Steel Products for Concen­
trated Hydrofluoric Acid Service 
S62.1 The maximum carbon equivalent based on heat 
analysis shall be as follows: 
Maximum section thickness less than or equal CE maximum = 0.43 
to 1 in. 
Maximum section thickness greater than 1 in. CE maximum = 0.45 
S62.2 Determine the carbon equivalent (CE) as follows: 
CE= C+Mnl6+(C r +Mo + V)/5+(N i + C u)/15 (1) 
S62.3 Vanadium and Niobium maximum content based on 
heat analysis shall be: 
Maximum Vanadium = 0.02 wt % 
Maximum NiobiumA = 0.02 wt % 
Maximum Vanadium plus NiobiumA = 0.03 wt % 
ANiobium = Columbium 
S62.4 The maximum composition based on heat analysis of 
Ni + Cu shall be 0.15 wt %. 
S62.5 The minimum C content based on heat analysis shall 
be 0.18 wt%. The maximum C content shall be as specified in 
the appropriate material specification.
