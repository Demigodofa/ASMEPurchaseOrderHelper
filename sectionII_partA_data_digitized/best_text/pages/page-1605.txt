temperature, the test result shall be the average (arithmetic 
mean) of the individual test values of three specimens from one 
test location. 
24.1.1 When a minimum average test result is specified: 
24.1.1.1 The test result is acceptable when all of the below 
are met: 
( 1) The test result equals or exceeds the specified minimum 
average (given in the specification), 
(2) The individual test value for not more than one speci­
men measures less than the specified minimum average, and 
( 3) The individual test value for any specimen measures 
not less than two-thirds of the specified minimum average. 
24.1.1.2 ff the acceptance requirements of 24.1.1.1 are not 
met, perform one retest of three additional specimens from the 
same test location. Each individual test value of the retested 
specimens shall be equal to or greater than the specified 
minimum average value. 
24.2 Test Specifying a Minimum Transition Temperature: 
24.2.1 Definition of Transition Temperature-For specifica­
tion purposes, the transition temperature is the temperature at 
which the designated material test value equals or exceeds a 
specified minimum test value. 
24.2.2 Determination of Transition Temperature: 
24.2.2.4 Accept the test result if the determined transition 
temperature is equal to or lower than the specified value. 
24.2.2.5 If the determined transition temperature is higher 
than the specified value, but not more than 12 °C higher than 
the specified value, test sufficient samples in accordance with 
Section 25 to plot two additional curves. Accept the test results 
if the temperatures determined from both additional tests are 
equal to or lower than the specified value. 
24.3 When subsize specimens are permitted or necessary, or 
both, modify the specified test requirement according to Table 
7 or test temperature according to codes such as ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code, Section Vill, Division I Table UG-
84.2, or both. Greater energies or lower test temperatures may 
be agreed upon by purchaser and supplier. 
25. Records 
25.1 The test record should contain the following informa­
tion as appropriate: 
25.1.1 Full description of material tested (that is, specifica­
tion number, grade, class or type, size, heat number). 
25.1.2 Specimen orientation with respect to the material 
axis.

24.2.2.1 Break one specimen at each of a series of tempera­
tures above and below the anticipated transition temperature 
using the procedures in Section 23. Record each test tempera­
ture to the nearest 0.5 °C. 
24.2.2.2 Plot the individual test results (J or percent shear) 
as the ordinate versus the corresponding test temperature as the 
abscissa and construct a best-fit curve through the plotted data 
points. 
24.2.2.3 If transition temperature is specified as the tem­
perature at which a test value is achieved, determine the 
temperature at which the plotted curve intersects the specified 
test value by graphical interpolation ( extrapolation is not 
permitted). Record this transition temperature to the nearest 
3 °C. If the tabulated test results clearly indicate a transition 
temperature lower than specified, it is not necessary to plot the 
data. Report the lowest test temperature for which test value 
exceeds the specified value.
