SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
SA-351/SA-351M 
The following supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the purchase order. A 
list of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser is included in 
Specifications A703/A703M and A985/A985M. Those which are ordinarily considered suitable for 
use with this specification are given below. Others enumerated in Specifications A 703/ A 703M and 
A985/A985M may be used with this specification upon agreement between the manufacturer and 
purchaser. 
S2. Destruction Tests 
SS. Radiographic Inspection 
S6. Liquid Penetrant Inspection 
SlO. Examination of Weld Preparation 
S33. Stabilization Heat Treatment of CFSC 
S33.l CP8C shall be stabilized at 1600 to 1650 °F [870 to 
900 °C] for a minimum time of 1 h/in. [25 mm] of thickness 
and water quenched or rapidly cooled by other means. The 
grade designation symbol shall be followed by the symbol 
"S33." 
S34. Stabilization Heat Treatment of CFlOMC 
S34.l CPl0MC shall be stabilized at 1600 to 1650 °F [870 
to 900 °C] for a minimum time of l h/in. [25 mm] of thickness 
and water quenched or rapidly cooled by other means. The 
grade designation symbol shall be followed by the symbol 
"S34." 
SSO. Post-Weld Heat Treatment 
S50.l All austenitic castings, except Grades HK, HT, and 
CT15C, which have been subjected to weld repairs, shall be 
given a post-weld solution heat treatment. 
S50.2 The post-weld treatment for grades CK3MCuN and 
CN3MN shall be as specified in Table 3, except that the 
minimum soak time for castings that have already been heat 
treated according to Table 3 may be 1 h.
