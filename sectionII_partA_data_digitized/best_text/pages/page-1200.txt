SA-672/SA-672M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
11.2.4 Thickness-The minimwn wall thickness at any point 
in the pipe shall not be more than 0.01 in. [0.3 mm] under the 
specified nominal thickness. 
11.3 Circumferential welded joints of the same quality as 
the longitudinal joints shall be permitted by agreement between 
the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
11.4 Lengths with unmachined ends shall be within -0, 
+½ in. [-0, + 13 mm] of that specified. Lengths with machined 
ends shall be as agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The finished pipe shall be free of injurious defects and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. This requirement is to mean 
the same as the identical requirement that appears in Specifi­
cation A20/ A20M with respect to steel plate surface finish. 
13. Product Marking 
13.1 In addition to the marking provision of Specification 
A530/A530M, class marking in accordance with 1.3.3 shall 
follow the grade marking; for example, C 70-10. 
13.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 13.1, 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall be applied only when specified by 
the purchaser in the inquiry, contract, or order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be 
agreed upon in writing by the manufacturer and purchaser. Supplementary requirements shall in no 
way negate any requirement of the specification itself. 
Sl. Tension and Bend Tests 
S 1.1 Tension tests in accordance with 8.1 and bend tests in 
accordance with 8.2 shall be made on specimens representing 
each length of pipe. 
S2. Charpy V-Notch Test (For pipe with nominal wall 
thickness of½ in. [13 mm] and greater) 
S2.1 Requirements-The acceptable test energies shall be as 
shown in Table Al.15 of Specification A20/A20M for the 
applicable plate specification unless otherwise stated in the 
order. As an alternative, the test temperature may be 10 °F [-12 
oc]. 
S2.2 Number of Specimens-Bach test shall consist of at 
least three specimens. 
S2.2.1 One base-metal test shall be made from one pipe 
length per heat, per heat-treat charge, and per nominal wall 
thickness. For pipe from Classes 10, 11, 12, and 13, one base 
metal test shall be made per heat per size and per wall 
thickness. 
S2.2.2 One weld-metal and one heat-affected zone (HAZ) 
metal test shall be made in accordance with NB 4335 of 
Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
S2.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation: 
S2.3.1 Base-metal specimens of stress-relieved, normalized, 
and normalized and tempered pipe shall be taken in accordance 
with the provisions for tension specimens in the body of this 
specification. 
S2.3.2 Base-metal specimens of quenched and tempered 
pipe shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of NB 
2225 of Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code. 
S3. Hardness Test 
S3.1 Hardness measurements in accordance with Test Meth­
ods and Definitions A370 or Test Method B110 shall be made 
across the welded joint at both ends of each length of pipe. The 
maximum acceptable hardness shall be as agreed upon between 
the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
S4. Product Analysis 
S4.1 Product analyses in accordance with 7 .1 shall be made 
on each 500 ft [150 m] of pipe or fraction thereof or 
alternatively, on each length of pipe as designated in the order. 
SS. Metallography 
S5.1 The manufacturer shall furnish one photomicrograph 
to show the microstructure of 1 OOx magnification of the weld 
metal or base metal of the pipe in the as-finished condition. The 
purchaser shall state in the order: the material, base metal or 
weld, and the nwnber and locations of tests to be made. This 
test is for information only. 
S6. Magnetic Particle Examination of Base Metal 
S6.1 All accessible surfaces of the pipe shall be examined in 
accordance with Methods B109 or B138. Accessible is defined 
as: All outside surfaces, all inside surfaces of pipe 24 in. [600 
mm] in diameter and greater, and inside surfaces of pipe less 
than 24 in. [600 mm] in diameter for a distance of one pipe 
diameter from the ends. 
S6.2 Acceptance Standards-The following relevant indi­
cations are unacceptable: 
S6.2.1 Any linear indications greater than 1/16 in. [1 mm] 
long for materials less than 5/s in. [16 mm] thick; greater than 
1/s in. [3 mm] long for materials 5/s in. [16 mm] thick to under
