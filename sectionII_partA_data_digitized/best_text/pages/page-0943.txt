ASME BPVC.II.A~2025 SA-508/SA-SOBM 
the upper and lower shelf foot-pound energies, with sufficient 
testing at intermediate temperatures to permit plotting a rea­
sonably smooth curve. 
S4. Additional Charpy Data 
S4.1 The percent shear fracture and mils of lateral 
expansion, defined in Test Methods and Definitions A370, shall 
be reported for each Charpy specimen tested. 
S4.2 Acceptance values for percent shear fracture and/or 
lateral expansion values shall be as specified by the purchaser. 
S5. Alternative Impact Test 
S5.1 Charpy impact tests shall be made in accordance with 
the provisions of 7.2 of the specification except that the test 
temperature shall be lower than specified in Table 3. This test 
shall be instead of that specified in 7 .2. 
S6. Drop-Weight Test 
S6.1 Drop-weight tests shall be conducted in accordance 
with the requirements of Test Method B208. The fracture plane 
of the specimens shall coincide with the location required for 
other mechanical test specimens as specified by the purchaser 
in accordance with 7.1.6. However, since the drop weight 
specimen can be taken in any orientation, the fracture plane of 
the specimen when tested to Method 1 (7.l.6.1) shall be a 
minimum distance of 7/16 in. [11 mm] from the nearest 
quenched surface, and 1 ½ in. [38 mm] from any second 
surface. The purchaser may specify either duplicate no-break 
performance when tested 10 °F [6 °C] warmer than a specified 
temperature or request a determination of the NDT tempera­
ture. 
S7. Restrictive Chemistry for Grades 4N and 5 
S7 .1 Phosphorus and sulfur limits for Grades 4N and 5 shall 
be 0.015 % maximum heat and 0.018 % maximum product. 
S8. Additional Vanadium 
S8.1 The vanadium content for Grade 5 forgings shall be 
0.05 to 0.15 %. 
S9. Restrictive Chemistry for Grades 2, 3, or 4N 
S9.1 Grades 2, 3, or 4N shall be specified with restricted 
phosphorus and copper limits, as follows: 
S9.1.1 P 0.012 maximum heat and 0.015 maximum product; 
Cu 0.10 maximum heat and product, or 
S9.1.2 P0.015 maximumheatand0.018 maximum product; 
Cu 0.15 maximum heat and product. 
S9.2 Grades 2, 3, 4N shall be specified with restricted sulfur 
of 0.D15 heat and 0,018 product. 
SlO. Alternative Fracture Toughness Requirements 
S10.1 The fracture toughness requirements (drop weight 
and Charpy impact tests) for materials oftheASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code, Section III, Articles NB 2300, NC 2300, 
ND 2300, NE 2300, NF 2300, or NG 2300, as specified, shall 
be used instead of the Charpy impact test requirements of this 
specification. 
Sll. Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized Steels 
S11.1 Material made to Grades 1, la, 2, 3, 4N, or 5 shall be 
vacuum carbon-deoxidized, in which case the silicon content 
shall be 0.10 % max. The test report shall indicate that the steel 
was vacuum carbon-deoxidized. 
S12. Vacuum-Treated Basic Oxygen Furnace Steels 
S12.1 For Grades 1, la, 2, or 3 material, vacuum-treated 
basic oxygen furnace steel shall be used. 
S13. Minimum Tempering Temperature 
S13.1 For Grades 2 Class 1 and 3 Class 1 the minimum 
tempering temperature shall be 1175 °F [635 °C] and the 
simulated post weld heat treatment temperature shall not 
exceed 1150 °F [620 °C] when S1 is required. 
S14. Cooling from -the Tempering Temperature 
S14.1 The purchaser shall provide specific cooling rates 
from the tempering temperature. 
S15. Product Analysis 
S15.1 More than one forging per heat shall be subject to 
product analysis by either the manufacturer or purchaser. The 
purchaser shall indicate in the ordering information the number 
of forgings to be tested, and whether the manufacturer, 
purchaser, or both shall perform the additional analyses. 
S16. Silicon Content 
S16.1 The silicon content shall be 0.05 to 0.15 % as a result 
of ladle refining with aluminum as the deoxidizer. Use of 
Vacuum Ladle Degassing is optional.
