22. Apparatus 
22.1 Testing Machines: 
22.1.1 A Charpy impact machine is one in which a notched 
specimen is broken by a single blow of a freely swinging 
pendulum. The pendulum is released from a fixed height. Since 
the height to which the pendulum is raised prior to its swing, 
and the mass of the pendulum are known, the energy of the 
blow is predetermined. A means is provided to indicate the 
energy absorbed in breaking the specimen. 
22.1.2 The other principal feature of the machine is a fixture 
(see Fig. 10) designed to support a test specimen as a simple 
beam at a precise location. The fixture is arranged so that the 
notched face of the specimen is vertical. The pendulum strikes 
the other vertical face directly opposite the notch. The dimen­
sions of the specimen supports and striking edge shall conform 
to Fig. 10. 
22.1.3 Charpy machines used for testing steel generally 
have capacities in the 220 to 300 ft-lbf (300 to 400 J) energy 
range. Sometimes machines of lesser capacity are used; 
however, the capacity of the machine should be substantially in 
excess of the absorbed energy of the specimens (see Test 
Methods E23). The linear velocity at the point of impact should 
be in the range of 16 to 19 ft/s (4.9 to 5.8 m/s). 
Norn 15-An investigation of striker radius effect is available. 
22.2 Temperature Media: 
22.2.1 For testing at other than room temperature, it is 
necessary to condition the Charpy specimens in media at 
controlled temperatures. 
22.2.2 Low temperature media usually are chilled fluids 
(such as water, ice plus water, dry ice plus organic solvents, or 
liquid nitrogen) or chilled gases. 
22.2.3 Elevated temperat11re media are usually heated liq­
uids such as mineral or silicone oils. Circulating air ovens may 
be used. 
22.3 Handling Equipment-Tongs, especially adapted to fit 
the notch in the impact specimen, normally are used for 
removing the specimens from the medium and placing them on 
the anvil (refer to Test Methods E23). In cases where the 
machine fixture does not provide for automatic centering of the 
test specimen, the tongs may be precision machined to provide 
centering. 
23. Sampling and Number of Specimens 
23.1 Sampling: 
23.1.1 Test location and orientation should be addressed by 
the specifications. If not, for wrought products, the test location 
shall be the same as that for the tensile specimen and the 
orientation shall be longitudinal with the notch perpendicular 
to the major surface of the product being tested. 
23.l.2 Number of Specimens. 
23.1.2.1 All specimens used for a Charpy impact test shall 
be taken from a single test coupon or test location. 
23.1.2.2 When the specification calls for a minimum aver­
age test result, three specimens shall be tested.

All dimensional tolerances shall be ±0.05 mm (0.002 in.) unless otherwise 
specified.

within 0.05 mm (0.002 in.). 
Norn 2-C shall be parallel to D within 20:1000 and coplanar with D 
within 0.125 mm (0.005 in.).

23.1.2.3 When the specification requires determination of a 
transition temperature, eight to twelve specimens are usually 
needed. 
23.2 Type and Size: 
23.2.1 Use a standard full size Charpy V-notch specimen as 
shown in Fig. 11, except as allowed in 23.2.2. 
603 
23.2.2 Subsized Specimens. 
23.2.2.1 For flat material less than 7/i6 in. (11 mm) thick, or 
when the absorbed energy is expected to exceed 80 % of full 
scale, use standard subsize test specimens. 
23.2.2.2 For tubular materials tested in the transverse 
direction, where the relationship between diameter and wall 
thickness does not permit a standard full size specimen, use 
standard subsize test specimens or standard size specimens 
containing outer diameter (OD) curvature as follows: 
( 1) Standard size specimens and subsize specimens may 
contain the original OD surface of the tubular product as shown 
in Fig. 12. All other dimensions shall comply with the 
requirements of Fig. 11. 
NoTE 16-For materials with toughness levels in excess of about 
50 ft-lbs, specimens containing the otiginal OD surface may yield values 
in excess of those resulting from the use of conventional Charpy 
specimens. 
23.2.2.3 If a standard full-size specimen cannot be prepared, 
the largest feasible standard subsize specimen shall be pre­
pared. The specimens shall be machined so that the specimen 
does not include material nearer to the surface than 0.020 in. 
(0.5 mm).
