7 .2 Steel may be produced as ingot-cast or strand-cast. 
When different grades of strand-cast steel are sequentially cast, 
identification and separation of the transition material is 
required. 
8. Dimensions, Tolerances, and Allowances 
8.1 Dimensions, tolerances, and allowances applicable to 
products covered by this specification are contained in Tables 
3-20 [Annex Al, Tables Al.l-Al.17]. The appropriate toler­
ance tables shall be identified in each individual specification. 
8.2 The appropriate thickness tolerance tables for measure­
ments taken 3/s in. [10 mm] from the edge are found in Section 
S 1 of the Supplementary Requirements in this specification. 
See the appropriate product specification for instructions on 
how to specify. 
8.3 When thickness is measured using hand held microm­
eters refer to Practice A1073/A1073M. 
8.4 Flatness Tolerances: 
8.4.1 Standard flatness tolerances are contained in Tables 13 
and 14 for hot-rolled sheet and Table 20 for cold-rolled sheet. 
8.4.2 Measurement techniques for flatness characteristics 
are described in Practice A1030/Al030M. 
8.4.3 Two alternative methods for flatness determination are 
the use of I-units and percent steepness. A description of these 
two alternative methods is contained in Practice A1030/ 
A1030M, as well as Appendix X5. 
8.4.3.1 The use of I-units or percent steepness as a flatness 
standard is subject to negotiation between the purchaser and 
the producer. 
8.4.3.2 Measurement techniques for I-units, percent 
steepness, and rejection limits are subject to negotiation 
between the purchaser and the producer. 
9. Finish and Condition 
9.1 Hot-rolled sheet has a surface with an oxide or scale 
resulting from the hot-rolling operation. The oxide or scale can 
be removed by piclding or blast cleaning when required for 
press-work operations or welding. Hot-rolled and hot-rolled 
descaled sheet is not generally used for exposed parts where 
- sutface-is-0f prime_importanc_e_._ _ _ _ _ _ 
particular contour. They may also contain some edge 
imperfections, the more common types of which are cracked 
edges, thin edges (feather), and damaged edges due to handling 
or processing and which should not extend in beyond the 
ordered width. These edge conditions are detrimental where 
joining of the mill edges by welding is practiced. When the 
purchaser intends to shear or to blank, a sufficient width 
allowance should be made when purchasing to ensure obtain­
ing the desired contour and size of the pattern sheet. The 
manufacturer may be consulted for guidance. Cut edges are the 
normal edges which result from the shearing, slitting, or 
trimming of mill-edge sheet. 
9.1.1.1 The ends of plain hot-rolled mill-edge coils are 
irregular in shape and are referred to as uncropped ends. Where 
such ends are not acceptable, the purchaser's order should so 
specify. Processed coils such as pickled or blast cleaned are 
supplied with square-cut ends. 
9.2 Cold-rolled carbon sheet (exposed) is intended for those 
applications where surface appearance is of primary impor­
tance. This class will meet requirements for controlled surface 
texture, surface quality, and flatness. It is normally processed 
by the manufacturer to be free of stretcher strain and fluting. 
Subsequent user roller leveling immediately before fabrication 
will minimize strain resulting from aging. 
9.2.1 Cold-rolled carbon sheet, when ordered for exposed 
applications, can be supplied in the following finishes: 
9.2.1.1 Matte finish is a dull finish, without luster, produced 
by rolling on rolls that have been roughened by mechanical or 
chemical means to various degrees of surface texture depend­
ing upon application. With some surface preparation matte 
finish is suitable for decorative painting. It is not generally 
recommended for bright plating. 
9 .2.1.2 Commercial bright finish is a relatively bright finish 
having a surface texture intermediate between that of matte and 
luster finish. With some surface preparation commercial bright 
finish is suitable for decorative painting or certain plating 
applications. If sheet is deformed in fabrication the surface 
may roughen to some degree and areas so affected will require 
surface preparation to restore surface texture to that of the 
undeformed areas; 
9.1.1 Hot-rolled sheet can be supplied with mill edges or cut 
edges as specified. Mill edges are the natural edges resulting 
from the hot-rolling operation. They do not conform to any 
~2.13 Luster finish 1s asmootfioright 1inisli produced by -
rolling on ground rolls and is suitable for decorative painting or 
plating with additional special surface preparation by the user.
