ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-106/SA-106M 
and reasonably uniform material free from injurious 
laminations, cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this 
supplementary requirement is specified, the number of tests per 
pipe required shall also be specified. If a specimen from any 
length shows objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, 
subject to removal of the defective end and subsequent retests 
indicating the remainder of the length to be sound and 
reasonably uniform material. 
S6. Carbon Equivalent 
S6.1 The steel shall conform to a carbon equivalent (CE) of 
0.50 maximum as determined by the following formula: 
%Mn %Cr+%Mo+%V %Ni+%Cu 
CE= o/oC+-6-+ 5 + 15 
S6.2 A lower CE maximum may be agreed upon between 
the purchaser and the producer. 
S6.3 The CE shall be reported on the test report. 
S7. Heat Treated Test Specimens 
S7 .1 At the request of the purchaser, one tensile test shall be 
performed by the manufacturer on a test specimen from each 
heat of steel furnished which has been either stress relieved at 
1250°F or normalized at 1650°F, as specified by the purchaser. 
Other stress relief or annealing temperatures, as appropriate to 
the analysis, may be specified by agreement between the 
purchaser and the manufacturer. The results of this test shall 
meet the requirements of Table 1. 
S8. Internal Cleanliness-Government Orders 
S8.1 The internal surface of hot finished ferritic steel pipe 
and tube shall be manufactured to a free of scale condition 
equivalent to the visual standard listed in SSPC-SP6. Cleaning 
shall be performed in accordance with a written procedure that 
has been shown to be effective. This procedure shall be 
available for audit. 
S9. Requirements for Carbon Steel Pipe for Hydrofluoric 
Acid Alkylation Service 
S9.1 The carbon equivalent (CE), based upon heat analysis, 
shall not exceed 0.43 % if the specified wall thickness is equal 
to or less than 1 in. [25.4 mm] or 0.45 % if the specified wall 
thickness is greater than 1 in. [25.4 mm]. 
S9.2 The carbon equivalent (CE) shall be determined using 
the following formula: 
CE = C + Mn/6 + (Cr+ Mo + V)/5 + (Ni + Cu)/15 
S9.3 Based upon heat analysis in mass percent, the vana­
dium content shall not exceed 0.02 %, the niobium content 
shall not exceed 0.02 %, and the sum of the vanadium and 
niobium contents shall not exceed 0.03 %. 
S9.4 Based upon heat analysis in mass percent, the sum of 
the nickel and copper contents shall not exceed 0.15 %. 
S9.5 Based upon heat analysis in mass percent, the carbon 
content shall not be less than 0.18 %. 
S9.6 Welding consumables of repair welds shall be of low 
hydrogen type. E60:XX electrodes shall not be used and the 
resultant weld chemical composition shall meet the chemical 
composition requirements specified for the pipe. 
S9.7 The designation "HF" shall be stamped or marked on 
each pipe to signify that the pipe complies with this supple­
mentary requirement.
