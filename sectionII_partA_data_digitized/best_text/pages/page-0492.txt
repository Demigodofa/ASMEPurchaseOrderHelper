SA-307 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Carbon Steel Bolts and Studs, 60 000 PSI Tensile Strength 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers the chemical and mechanical 
requirements of three grades of carbon steel bolts and studs in 
sizes ¼ in. through 4 in. The fasteners are designated by 
"Grade" denoting tensile strength and intended use, as follows: 
Grade 
Grade A 
Description 
Bolts and studs having a 
minimum tensile strength of 
60 ksi and intended for 
general applications, 
Grade B Bolts and studs having a 
tensile strength of 60 to 100 
ksi and intended for flanged 
joints in piping systems with 
cast iron flanges, and 
Grade C Replaced by Specification 
F1554 Gr.36 
1.1.1 The term studs includes stud stock, sometimes re­
ferred to as threaded rod. 
1.2 This specification does not cover requirements for 
machine screws, thread cutting/forming screws, mechanical 
expansion anchors or similar externally threaded fasteners. 
1.3 Suitable nuts are covered in Specification A563. Unless 
otherwise specified, the grade and style of nut for each grade of 
fastener, of all surface finishes, shall be as follows: 
Fastener Grade and Size 
A¼to 1½ in. 
A over 1½ to 4 in. 
B, ¼to 4 in. 
Nut Grade and StyleA 
A, hex 
A, heavy hex 
A, heavy hex 
A Nuts of other grades and styles having specified proof load stresses (Speci­
fication A563, Table 3) greater than the specified grade and style of nut are also 
suitable. 
1.4 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as the standard. 
1.5 Supplementary Requirement S 1 of an optional nature is 
provided, which describes additional restrictions to be applied 
when bolts are to be welded. It shall apply only when specified 
in the inquiry, order, and contract. 
1.6 Terms used in this specification are defined in Termi­
nology Fl 789 unless otherwise defined herein.
