ASME SA-312/SA-312M replaces para. 6.2 of ASTM A312/A312M with the following: 
6.2 Heat Treatment - All pipe shall be furnished in the heat-treated condition in accordance with the requirements of 
Table 2. Other than for Grades S33228, S30815, S31272, and the H Grades, seamless pipe immediately following hot 
forming may be individually quenched by water or rapidly cooled by other means, provided that the temperature of the 
pipes after hot forming is not Jess than the minimum specified solution treatment temperature in Table 2. For H Grades, as 
well as Grades S33228, S30815, and S31272, the pipes shall be reheated to the specified solution treatment for the re­
quired time before quenching.
