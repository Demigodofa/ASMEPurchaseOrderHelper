ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-6/SA-6M 
order to obtain a higher level of confidence in avoiding cold 
cracking, the chemistry controls in S3 l are available. A 
purchaser who specifies the use of S31. should be aware that 
there are several factors involved in the judicious selection of 
a maximum CE value, such as the following: 
X3 .4.1 Actual production joint restraint/base metal 
thickness(es), 
X3.4.2 Filler metal and base metal strength compatibility, 
X3.4.3 Deposited weld metal diffusible hydrogen content, 
X3.4.4 Preheat and interpass temperatures, 
X3.4.5 Filler metal and base metal cleanliness, and 
X3.4.6 Heat input. 
X3.5 Though it is widely believed that low CE steels are 
immune to weld cracking problems, failure to consider these 
factors and others have resulted in weld or base metal HAZ 
(heat affected zone) cracks in such steels.11 
X3.6 It is important to note that carbon equivalence is only 
a qualitative assessment of potential welding problems, and 
should never be solely relied on to ensure weld integrity. The 
proper use of welding specifications, coupled with the knowl­
edge of actual construction conditions, must also be used. 
X4. RADIUS FOR COLD BENDING 
X4.1 Suggested minimum inside bend radii for cold form­
ing are referenced to Group Designations A to F inclusive as 
defined in Table X4. l. The suggested radii listed in Table X4.2 
should be used as minimums in typical shop fabrication. 
Material that does not form satisfactorily when fabricated in 
accordance with Table X4.2 may be subject to rejection 
pending negotiation with the steel supplier. When tighter bends 
are required, the manufacturer should be consulted. 
X4.2 The bend radius and the radius of the male die should 
be as liberal as the finished part will permit. The width across 
the shoulders of the female die should be at least eight times 
the plate thickness. Higher strength steels require larger die 
openings. The surface of the dies in the area of radius should 
be smooth. 
X4.2.1 Since cracks in cold bending commonly originate 
from the outside edges, shear burrs and gas cut edges should be 
removed by grinding. Sharp comers on edges and on punched 
or gas cut holes should be removed by chamfering or grinding 
to a radius. 
X4.2.2 If possible, parts should be formed such that the 
bend line is perpendicular to the direction of final rolling. If it 
is necessary to bend with the bend line parallel to the direction 
of final rolling, a more generous radius is suggested (1 ½ times 
applicable value given in Table X4.2 for bend lines perpen­
dicular to the direction of rolling).

A Steels having a ratio of specified minimum tensile strength to specified minimum 
yield strength of 1.15 or less are in Group F; other steels are in Groups A to E 
inclusive, which are grouped on the basis of their having similar specified values 
for minimum elongation in 2 in. [50 mm]. 
8 Grade designations are not applicable for this specification.
