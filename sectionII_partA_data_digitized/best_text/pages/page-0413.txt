A Quenched in water or rapidly cooled by other methods, at a rate sufficient to prevent reprecipitation of chromium carbides, as demonstrated by the capability of passing 
Practices A262, Practice E. The manufacturer is not required to run the test unless it is specified on the purchase order (See Supplementary Requirement S6). Note that 
Practices A262 requires the test to be performed on sensitized specimens in the low carbon and stabilized types and on specimens representative of the as-shipped 
condition of the other types. In the case of low-carbon types containing 3 % or more molybdenum, the applicability of the sensitizing treatment prior to testing shall be a 
matter for negotiation between the seller and purchaser. • 
8 Quenched in water or rapidly cooled by other methods. 
c A solution treating temperature above 1950 °F [1065 °C] may impair resistance to intergranular corrosion after subsequent exposure to sensitizing conditions in the 
indicated grades. When specified by the purchaser, a lower temperature stabilization or re-solution anneal shall be used subsequent to the higher-temperature solution 
anneal prescribed in this table (See Supplementary Requirement S4). 
0 cooled in still air, or faster. 
difficult to test the sample as a single piece, the sample may be 
sectioned into smaller pieces provided a minimum of 4 in. of 
weld is subjected to reverse bending. 
NOTE 1-The reverse bend test is not applicable when the specified wall 
is 10 % or more of the specified outside diameter, or the wall thickness is 
0.134 in. [3.4 mm) or greater, or the outside diameter size is less than 
0.375 in. [9.5 mm). Under these conditions the reverse flattening test of 
Specification Al016/Al016M shall apply. 
12. Grain Size Requirement 
12.1 The grain size of Grades TP309H, TP309HCb, 
TP310H and TP310HCb, as determined in accordance with 
Test Methods E112, shall be No. 6 or coarser. 
12.2 The grain size of Grades TP304H, TP316H, TP321H, 
TP347H and TP348H, as determined in accordance with Test 
Methods El12, shall be No. 7 or coarser. 
12.3 The grain size of Grade UNS S32615, as determined in 
accordance with Test Methods E112, shall be No. 3 or finer. 
12.4 The grain size of N08810 and N08811, as determined 
in accordance with Test Methods El12, shall be 5 or coarser. 
13. Mechanical Tests and Grain Size Determinations 
Required 
13.1 Tension Test-One tension test shall be made on a 
specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall 
be made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes (See 13.9.2). 
13 .2 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used 
for the flange test, from each lot (See 13.9.1). 
13.3 Flange Test-One flange test shall be made on speci­
mens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used for 
the flattening test, from each lot (See 13.9.1). 
361 
13.4 Reverse-Bend Test-One reverse-bend test shall be 
made on a specimen from each 1500 ft [450 m] of finished 
tubing. 
13.5 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot (See 
13.9.2) .
