SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the purchase order. 
Lists of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser are included 
in Specifications A703/A703M and A985/A985M. Those which are ordinarily considered suitable for 
use with this specification are given below. Others enumerated in Specifications A703/A703M and

tory thermal stress relief or complete reheat treatment in 
accordance with the qualified procedure after all weld repairs. 
S52. Lower Maximum Phosphorus or Sulfur Contents 
S52.1 When specified in the order, the maximum phosphorus 
or sulfur contents shall be as follows: 
S52.2 For WC6, the maximum phosphorus content shall not 
exceed 0.030 % and the maximum sulfur content shall not 
exceed 0.025 %.

S52.6 For CA15, the maximum phosphorus content shall not 
exceed 0.025% and the maximum sulfur content shall not 
exceed 0.020 %. 
S53. Temper Embrittlement Factor 
S53.1 When specified by the purchaser, the composition of 
Grade WC9, based on heat analysis, shall be restricted in 
accordance with the following equations: 
J=(Si+Mn) X (P + Sn) X 104 s; 180(Si, Mn, P, and Sn in wt%) 
Cu:5 0.20 % 
Nis; 0.30 % 
S53.1.1 Lower values of J, Cu, and Ni can be specified by 
agreement between the purchaser and the supplier. 
S53.1.2 The values of J shall be reported. 
S53.1.3 If WC9 castings are repaired by welding, the 
composition of the weld deposit shall be restricted in accor­
dance with the following equations: 
X=(l0P + 5Sb + 4Sn + As)/100 s; 15(P, Sb, Sn, and As in ppm) 
Cus; 0.20 % 
Nis; 0.30 %
