3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions: 
3.1.1 The definitions in Test Methods and Definitions A370, 
Terminology A941, and Test Methods Al058 are applicable to 
this specification and to those listed in 1. 1. 
3.1.2 chaplet, n-a chaplet is a metallic support placed in a 
mold cavity to maintain the spacing between a core and the 
mold. 
3.1.3 electronic data interchange (EDI), n-the computer­
to-computer exchange of business information in a standard 
format such as ANSI ASC X12. 
3.1.4 heat, n-all the molten metal poured from a single 
furnace or all the molten metal from two or more furnaces 
poured into a single ladle or casting prior to the replenishing of 
the fumace(s). 
3.1.5 internal chill, n-an internal chill is a metallic device 
placed in a mold cavity to increase the rate of heat removal at 
that location. 
3.1.6 test coupon, n-the part from which the test specimen 
will be extracted. 
3.1.7 test specimen, n-the part that will be acted upon in a 
mechanical test. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Melting Process-The steel shall be made by open­
hearth or electric-furnace process, with or without separate 
refining such as argon-oxygen-decarburization (AOD), unless 
otherwise designated by the individual specification. 
4.2 Heat Treatment: 
4.2.1 Ferritic and martensitic steel shall be cooled after 
pouring to provide substantially complete transformation of 
austenite prior to heat treatment to enhance mechanical prop­
erties. 
4.2.2 Castings shall be heat treated in the working zone of a 
fumace that has been surveyed in accordance with Test Method 
A991/A991M. 
4.2.2.1 When castings are heat treated at temperatures 
above 2000 °F [1100 °C], then the working zone shall have 
been established by a survey performed at not more than 25 °F 
[15 °C] below nor more than 200 °F [110 °C] above the 
minimum heat treatment temperature specified for the grade. If 
a minimum heat treatment temperature is not specified for the 
grade, then the survey temperature shall be not more than 50 °F
