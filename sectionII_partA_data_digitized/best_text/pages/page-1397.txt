5.15.2 Class WP-WX-Radiographic inspection of all 
welds, made with or without the addition of filler metal, is 
required (see 5.5). 
5.15.3 Class WP-WU-IBtrasonic inspection of all welds, 
made with or without the addition of filler metal, is required 
(see 5.6). 
5.15.4 Deleted 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 Unless otherwise stated herein, heat treatment shall be 
performed after welding and in accordance with the require­
ments of Table 2. 
6.1.1 No final heat treatment of welded fittings (HT-O) 
fabricated from ferritic/austenitic plate that has been heat 
treated as required by Table 2 for the particular grade, is 
required, provided material representative of the fittings, in­
cluding base metal, weld metal, and heat affected zone, passes 
a Test Methods A923 Method B or C (See Note 1) corrosion 
evaluation per heat. Each fitting supplied under this require­
ment shall be stenciled with the suffix HT-O. 
6.1.2 For materials not listed in Table 3 of Test Methods 
A923, the HT-O provision does not apply. 
NoTE 1-The Test Methods A923 test method (B or C) is at the 
manufacturer's option, unless otherwise specified by the purchaser. 
6.2 All fittings machined directly from forgings or bars (see 
5.12), previously heat treated in accordance with the require­
ments specified in Table 2, need not be reheat treated. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The chemical composition of each cast or heat shall be 
detennined and shall conform to the requirements of the 
chemical composition for the respective grades of materials 
listed in Table 1. Metl1ods and practices relating to chemical 
analyses required by this specification shall be in accordance 
with Methods, Practices, and Definitions A751. Product analy­
sis tolerances in accordance with Specification A960/ A960M 
are applicable. 
7 .2 Except as listed below, in fittings of welded construc­
tion, the composition of the deposited weld shall conform to 
the same requirements as the base metal. 
7.2.1 Welds on S32950 base metal shall be made with 
nominal 26 % Cr, 8 % Ni, 2 % Mo weld metal. 
7.2.2 Welds on S31803 base metal shall conform to the 
same requirements as the base metal or shall be made with 
nominal 22 % Cr, 9 % Ni, 3 % Mo weld metal. 
7.2.3 Welds on S32202 base metal shall be made with 
nmninal 22 % Cr, 9 % Ni, 3 % Mo weld metal. 
8. Tensile Requirements 
8.1 The tensile properties of the fitting material shall con­
form to the requirements of Table 3. The testing and reporting 
shall be performed in accordance with Specification A960/ 
A960M. 
8.2 The fittings manufacturer shall perform a tensile test on 
material representative of the finished fitting. Records of the
