identification legibly stenciled on top of each lift or shown on 
a tag attached to each coil or shipping unit. 
15.2 When specified in the contract or order, and for direct 
procurement by or direct shipment to the government, marking 
for shipment in addition to requirements specified in the 
contract or order, shall be in accordance with MIL-STD-129 
for military agencies and in accordance with Fed. Std. No. 123 
for civil agencies. 
15.3 Bar coding is acceptable as a supplementary identifi­
cation method. Bar coding should be consistent with the 
Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) standard prepared 
by the primary metals subcommittee of the AIAG bar code 
project team. 
16. Packing and Package Marking 
16.1 Unless otherwise specified, the sheet shall be packaged 
and loaded in accordance with Practices A700. 
16.2 When coils are ordered, it is customary to specify a 
minimum or range of inside diameter, maximum outside 
diameter, and a maximum coil weight, if required. The ability 
of manufacturers to meet the maximum coil weights depends 
upon individual mill equipment. When required, minimum coil 
weights are subject to negotiation.

delivery requirements; high strength low alloy steel; hot-rolled 
steel sheet; steel sheet; structural steel sheet 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the 
purchase order or contract. 
Sl. Thickness Tolerances 
Sl.l See Tables Sl.1-Sl.6. 
TABLE S1.1 Thickness Tolerances for Hot-Rolled Sheet (Carbon and Str.uctural Steel Only)-3/a-in. (Cut Edge) and ¾-in. (Mill Edge) 
Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut Lengths, Including Pickled) 
NoTE 1-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than 3/s in. from a cut edge and not less than ¾ in. from a mill edge. This table 
does not apply to the uncropped ends of mill edge coils. 
NoTE 2-Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in. 
[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm]. 
Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements. 
NoTE 3-This table was used to construct Table 4 by multiplying the values in this table by 0.75 and rounding to 3 decimal places using standardASTM 
practice. 
Norn 4-The thickness of mateiial <1 in. wide shall be measured at mid-width.
