individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat-rolled stock 
or tubes which do not meet the requirements of the specifica­

8. Permissible Variations in Dimensions for Round 
Tubing 
8.1 Diameter and Wall Thickness (Hot-Rolled Steel)­
Variations from specified outside diameter for "as-welded" and 
"as-welded and annealed" tubing made from hot-rolled steel 
shall not exceed the amounts prescribed in Table 4. Permissible 
variations in outside diameter for tubing that has been sink­
drawn for closer tolerance on outside diameter are shown in 
Table 5. Permissible variations in wall thickness for tubing that 
has been sink-drawn for closer tolerances on outside diameters 
are ± 10 % of the nominal wall or ±0.010 in. [0.25 mm], 
whichever is greater. Permissible variations in wall thickness 
for tubing made from hot-rolled steel are shown in Tables 6 and 
7. Permissible variation in outside and inside diameter for 
tubing made from hot-rolled steel that has been Drawn Over a 
Mandrel (DOM) for closer tolerances are shown in Table 5 
with wall tolerances shown in Tables 8 and 9. 
8.2 Diameter and Wall Thickness (Cold-Rolled Steel)­
Variations in outside diameter and inside diameter of "as­
welded" and "as-welded and annealed" tubing made from 
cold-rolled steel are shown in Table 10. Outside diameter 
tolerances for cold-rolled steel tubing, sink drawn and DOM, 
are shown in Table 5. Wall thickness tolerances for "as­
welded" tubing made from cold-rolled steel are shown in 
Tables 11 and 12. Permissible variations in wall thickness for 
round tubing, DOM for closer tolerances, are shown in Tables 
8 and 9. Permissible variations in wall thickness for tubing that 
has been sink-drawn for closer tolerances on outside diameter 
are ± 10 % of the nominal wall or ±0.010 in. [0.25 mm], 
whichever is greater. 
8.3 Length (Hot- and Cold-Rolled Steel)-Mechanical tub­
ing is commonly furnished in mill lengths 5 ft [1.5 m] an:d over. 
measured at any one cross section. The ovality shall be within 
the tolerances except when the wall thickness is less than 3 % 
of the outside diameter. 
8.6.1 In such cases for Types 1 and 2 (A.W.H.R. and 
A.W.C.R.) the ovality may be 50 % greater than the outside 
tolerances but the mean outside diameter shall be within the 
specified tolerance. 
8.6.2 For Types 3, 4, 5, and 6 (S.D.H.R., S.D.C.R., DOM, 
and S.S.I.D.) the additional ovality shall be as follows but the 
mean outside diameter shall be within the specified tolerance:

9. Permissible Variations in Dimensions of Square and 
Rectangular Tubing 
9.1 Diameter and Wall Thickness-Permissible variations in 
outside dimensions for square and rectangular tubing shall be 
as given in Table 16. The wall thickness tolerance is ± 10 % of 
the nominal wall thickness. 
9.2 Comer Radii-Unless otherwise specified, the comers 
of square and rectangular tubing shall be slightly rounded 
inside and outside, consistent with wall thickness. The outside 
comers may be slightly flattened. The radii of corners shall be 
as given in Table 17. 
9.3 Squareness-Permissible variations for squareness shall 
be determined by the following equation: 
±b = c x 0.006 in. (0.15 mm)
