SA-335/SA-335M (ASTM A335/A335M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Vickers, or Rockwell hardness tests shall be made on one 
specimen from each lot. For pipe of all other grades, a hardness 
test is not required. 
14.4 Flattening Test: 
14.4.1 The flattening test of Specification A999/A999M 
shall be made on a specimen from one end of the pipe with the 
number of tests as specified in 14.2. Crop ends may be used. If 
a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility 
prior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening 
test requirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat­
ment in accordance with Specification A999/ A999M and 
satisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails 
because of a lack of soundness that length shall be rejected, 
unless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length 
is sound. 
14.5 Bend Test: 
14.5.1 For pipe whose diameter exceeds NPS 25 and whose 
diameter to wall thickness ratio is 7.0 or less shall be subjected 
to the bend test instead of the flattening test. Other pipe whose 
diameter equals or exceeds NPS 10 may be given the bend test 
in place of the flattening test subject to the approval of the 
purchaser. 
14.5.2 The bend test specimens shall be bent at room 
temperature through 180° without cracking on the outside of 
the bent portion. The inside diameter of the bend shall be 1 in. 
[25 mm]. 
14.5 .3 Test specimens for the bend test shall be cut from one 
end of the pipe with the number of tests as specified in 14.2 
and, unless otherwise specified, shall be taken in a transverse 
direction. One test specimen shall be taken as close to the outer 
surface as possible and another from as close to the inner 
surface as possible. The specimens shall be either ½ by ½ in. 
[12.5 by 12.5 mm] in section or 1 by ½ in. [25 by 12.5 mm] in 
section with the comers rounded to a radius not over 1/16 in. 
[1.6 mm] and need not exceed 6 in. [150 mm] in length. The 
side of the samples placed in tension during the bend shall be 
the side closest to the inner and outer surface of the pipe, 
respectively. 
15. Certification 
15.1 Certification and test reports, as described in Section 
25 of Specification A999/A999M, are required. 
15.2 In addition to the information required by Specification 
A999/ A999M, the certification shall state whether or not the 
pipe was hydrostatically tested. If the pipe was nondestruc­
tively examined, the certification shall so state and shall show 
which practice was followed and what reference discontinuities 
were used. In addition, the test method information as given in 
Table 9 shall be appended to the specification number and 
grade shown on the certification. 
16. Product Marking 
16.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A999/A999M, the marking shall include the length, an addi­
tional symbol "S", if the pipe conforms to any of the Supple­
mentary Requirements Sl to S6, the schedule number, if the 
pipe is ordered to a schedule number, and the heat number or 
manufacturer's number by which the heat can be identified. 
Furthermore, the marking designated in Table 9 to indicate the 
test method(s) shall be included. Marking may be by stenciling, 
stamping, or rolling. Pipe that has been weld repaired in 
accordance with 7.6 shall be marked "WR." 
16.2 P91 shall be additionally marked with the appropriate 
Type. 
17. Government Procurement 
17 .1 Scale Free Pipe: 
17 .1.1 When specified in the contract or order, the following 
requirements shall be considered in the inquiry contract or 
order, for agencies of the U.S. Government where scale free 
pipe is required. These requirements shall take precedence if 
there is a conflict between these requirements and the product 
specification. 
17 .1.2 The requirements of Specification A999/ A999M for 
pipe shall be applicable when pipe is ordered to this specifi­
cation. 
17 .1.3 Pipe shall be one of the following grades as specified 
herein: 
Grade 
P11 
P22 
P5 
17.1.4 Part Number:
