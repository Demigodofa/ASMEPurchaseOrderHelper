SA/EN 10028-4 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR FLAT PRODUCTS MADE OF 
STEELS FOR PRESSURE PURPOSES 
Part 4: Nickel Alloy Steels With Specified Low 
Temperature Properties 
SA/EN 10028-4 
(Identical with International Specification EN 10028-4:2017 with these additional requirements.) 
1. Additional Requirements 
1.1 General Requirements: 
All "see EN 10028-1" shall be read as "shall be according 
to EN 10028-1." 
1.2 Marking: 
(a) In addition to the marking requirements of this 
specification, all products required to be marked and 
material identification used on all documentation 
required by this specification are to be identified by 
this SA/EN specification designation. 
(b) Plates that have been given the full heat treatment 
required by para. 8.2.2 shall be marked by the party 
performing the heat treatment with the letters designating 
the applicable heat treatment condition in Table A.1 ofEN 
10028-4 following the stamped steel name or number. 
( c) Plates that are not heat treated but are qualified on 
the basis of heat treated specimens per para. 8.2.3 shall be 
stamped with letter "G" following the stamped specifica­
tion designation. 
(d) When such plates are subsequently heat treated, 
they shall be marked by the party that performed the 
heat treatment, as required by (b) above following the 
required stamped specification designation. 
1.3 Chemical Composition: 
The requirements of paras. 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 on heat 
analysis, and of paras. 7.2.3 and 7.2.4 on product analysis, 
of SA-20/SA-20M shall apply. 
1.4 Tension Tests: 
For quenched and tempered plates one tension test 
shall be taken from each end of the heat treated plate. 
The gage length of the tension test specimens shall be 
taken at least 1 T from any heat treated edge, where T 
is the thickness of the plate, and shall be at least 1/ 2 in. 
(12.5 mm) from flame cut or heat-affected-zone surfaces. 
1.5 Impact Tests: 
1.5.1 Impact Test Sampling: 
Deviation from the requirement for preparation of test 
pieces for impact testing in EN 10028-1 shall not be 
permitted in SA/EN 10028-4. 
1.5.2 The impact test specimens shall be taken from 
a location adjacent to the tension test specimens and shall 
be at least 1 T from any heat treated edge. 
1.6 Steelmaking Process: 
The ratio of reduction of thickness from a strand-cast 
slab to plate shall be at least 3.0:1. 
1.7 Quality: 
1.7.1 Surface Imperfections 
(a) Shallow imperfections shall be ground to sound 
metal; the ground area shall be well faired and the thick­
ness of the ground plate shall not be reduced below the 
minimum thickness permitted.
