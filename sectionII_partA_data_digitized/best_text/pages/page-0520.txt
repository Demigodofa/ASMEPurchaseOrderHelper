3. Ordering Information 
3.l It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order all information necessary to purchase the 
needed materials. Examples of such information include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 
3 .1.1 Quantity and size, 
3.1.2 Heat-treated condition, that is, for the austenitic stain­
less steels, solution-treated (Class l); solution-treated after 
finishing (Class IA); and annealed and strain-hardened (Class 
2), 
3.1.3 Description of items required (bars, bolts, screws, or 
studs), 
3.1.4 Nuts and washers, if required by the purchaser, in 
accordance with Section 10, and 
3.1.5 Special requirements, in accordance with 5.1.1, 5.1.3, 
5.1.4, and 13.1. 
4. Common Requirements 
4.1 Bolting materials and bolting components supplied to 
this specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci­
fication A962/ A962M. These requirements include test 
methods, finish, thread dimensions, macroetch ( carbon and 
alloy steels only) marking, certification, optional supplemen­
tary requirements, and others. Failure to comply with the 
requirements of Specification A962/ A962M constitutes non­
conformance with this specification. In case of conflict be­
tween the requirements in this specification and Specification 
A962/A962M, this specification shall prevail. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Heat Treatment: 
5.1.1 Bolting materials shall be allowed to cool to room 
temperature after rolling or forging. Grades L7, L7A, L7B, 
L7C, L7M, L43, Ll, L70, L71, L72, and L73 shall be reheated

to above the upper critical temperature and liquid quenched 
and tempered. Grades B8, B8C, B8M, B8T, B8F, BSP, BSLN, 
and BSMLN shall receive a carbide solution treatment. Prod­
ucts made from such material are described as Class 1. This 
shall consist of holding the bolting material for a sufficient time 
at a temperature at which the chromium carbide will go into 
solution and then cooling in air or in a liquid medium at a rate 
sufficient to prevent reprecipitation of the carbide. Bolting 
material thus treated is described as Class 1. If specified in the 
purchase order, bolting material shall be solution treated in the 
finished condition and shall be described as Class lA. 
468 
5.1.2 Use of water quenching is prohibited for any ferritic 
grade when heat treatment is performed after heading or 
threading. 
5.1.3 When increased mechanical properties are desired, 
austenitic bolting shall be solution annealed and strain hard­
ened if specified in the purchase order; material so treated is 
identified as Class 2. 
5 .1.4 If scale-free bright finish is required, this shall be 
specified in the purchase order. 
5.1.5 For L7M bolting, the final heat treatment, which may 
be the tempering or stress-relieving operation conducted at 
1150 °F [620 °C] minimum, shall be done after machining or 
rolling of the threads and any type of cutting. 
6. Mechanical Requirements 
6.1 Tensile Properties: 
6.1.1 Bolting material as represented by the tension speci­
mens shall conform to the requirements as to tensile properties 
prescribed in Table 1 at room temperature after heat treatment 
(see 5.1.1). Alternatively, Class 2 Strain Hardened Headed 
Bolting Components shall be tested full size after strain 
hardening to determine tensile strength and yield strength and 
shall conform to the requirements prescribed in Table 1. 
Should the results of full size tests conflict with results of 
tension specimen tests, full size test results shall prevail. 
6.1.2 Number of Tests: 
6.1.2.1 For heat-treated bars, one tension test and one 
impact test consisting of three specimens shall be made for 
each diameter of each heat represented in each tempering 
charge. When heat treated without interruption in continuous 
furnaces, the material in a lot shall be the same heat, same prior 
condition, same size, and subjected to the same heat treatment. 
Not fewer than two tensile tests and two impact tests are 
required for each lot containing 20 000 lbs [9000 kg] or less. 
Every additional 10 000 lbs [4500 kg] or fraction thereof 
requires an additional tensile test and impact test.
