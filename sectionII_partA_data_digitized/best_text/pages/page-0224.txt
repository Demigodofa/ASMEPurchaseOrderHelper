decrease in wall thickness below o/is in. [7.9 mm] from the basic 
minimum elongation of the following percentage shall be made 
A The minimum elongation in 2 in. [50 mm) shall be determined by the following equation: 
e = 625000A 0 •2 / U 0 ·• 
for inch-pound units, and 
e = 1 940A 0 •2 / U 0 ·• 
for SI units, 
where: 
e minimum elongation in 2 in. [50 mm], %, rounded to the nearest 0.5 %, 
A cross-sectional area of the tension test specimen, in. 2 [mm 2 ], based upon specified outside diameter or nominal specimen width and specified wall thickness, 
rounded to the nearest 0.01 in. 2 [1 mm 2 ). (II the area thus calculated is equal to or greater than 0.75 in.2 [500 mm"], then the value 0.75 in.2 [500 mm 2 ] 
shall be used.), and 
U specified tensile strength, psi [MPa]. 
without developing cracks. When ordered for close coiling, the 
pipe shall stand being bent cold through 180° around a 
cylindrical mandrel, the diameter of which is eight times the 
outside diameter (as shown in ASME B 36.lOM) of the pipe, 
without failure. 
11.2 For pipe whose diameter exceeds 25 in. [635 mm] and 
whose diameter to wall thickness ratio, where the diameter to 
wall thickness ratio is the specified outside diameter divided by 
the nominal wall thickness, is 7 .0 or less, the bend test shall be 
conducted. The bend test specimens shall be bent at room 
temperature through 180° with the inside diameter of the bend 
being 1 in. [25 mm] without cracking on the outside portion of 
the bent portion. 
Example: For 28 in. [711 mm] diameter 5.000 in. [127 mm] 
thick pipe the diameter to wall thickness ratio = 28/5 = 5.6 
[711/127 = 5.6]. 
12. Flattening Tests 
12.1 Although testing is not required, pipe shall be capable 
of meeting the flattening test requirements of Supplementary 
Requirement S3, if tested. 
13. Hydrostatic Test 
13.1 Except as allowed by 13.2, 13.3, and 13.4, each length 
of pipe shall be subjected to the hydrostatic test without 
leakage through the pipe wall. 
13.2 As an alternative to the hydrostatic test at the option of 
the manufacturer or where specified in the purchase order, it 
shall be permissible for the full body of each pipe to be tested 
with a nondestructive electric test described in Section 14. 
13.3 Where specified in the purchase order, it shall be 
permissible for pipe to be furnished without the hydrostatic test 
and without the nondestructive electric test in Section 14; in 
172 
this case, each length so furnished shall include the mandatory 
marking of the letters "NH." It shall be permissible for pipe 
meeting the requirements of 13.1 or 13.2 to be furnished where 
pipe without either the hydrostatic or nondestructive electric 
test has been specified in the purchase order; in this case, such 
pipe need not be marked with the letters "NH." Pipe that has 
failed either the hydrostatic test of 13.1 or the nondestructive 
electric test of 13.2 shall not be furnished as "NH" pipe. 
13.4 Where the hydrostatic test and the nondestructive 
electric test are omitted and the lengths marked with the letters 
"NH," the certification, where required, shall clearly state "Not 
Hydrostatically Tested," and the letters "NH" shall be ap­
pended to the product specification number and material grade 
shown on the certification. 
14. Nondestructive Electric Test 
14.1 As an alternative to the hydrostatic test at the option of 
the manufacturer or where specified in the purchase order as an 
alternative or addition to the hydrostatic test, the full body of 
each pipe shall be tested with a nondestructive electric test in 
accordance with Practice E213, E309, or E570. In such cases, 
the marking of each length of pipe so furnished shall include 
the letters "NOE." It is the intent of this nondestructive electric 
test to reject pipe with imperfections that produce test signals 
equal to or greater than that produced by the applicable 
calibration standard. 
14.2 Where the nondestructive electric test is performed, the 
lengths shall be marked with the letters "NOE." The 
certification, where required, shall state "Nondestructive Elec­
tric Tested" and shall indicate which of the tests was applied. 
Also, the letters "NDE" shall be appended to the product 
specification number and material grade shown on the certifi­
cation.
