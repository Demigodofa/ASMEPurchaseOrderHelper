4. General Requirements 
4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A999/ A999M, unless otherwise provided herein. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Discard: 
5 .1.1 A sufficient discard shall be made from each ingot to 
secure freedom from injurious defects. The steel shall have a 
homogeneous structure. 
5.2 Manufacture: 
5.2.1 Material for forging shall consist of ingots or of 
blooms, billets, or solid-rolled bars forged or rolled from an 
ingot, and cut to the required length by a process that will not 
produce injurious defects in the forging. 
5.2.2 The material shall be forged (Note 3) by hammering or 
pressing, and shall be brought as nearly as practicable to the 
finished shape and size by hot working. 
NoTE 3-The cross-sectional area of the solid forging shall have a 
reduction by forging or by rolling and forging from that of the ingot in the 
ratio of not less than 3 to 1. 
5.2.3 Unless otherwise specified, the final forging operation 
shall be followed by a treatment suitable to the grade as 
specified in 5.4. 
5.3 Machining: 
5.3.1 All forgings shall have both the inner and outer 
surfaces machined. 
5.3.2 After heat treatment, the pipe shall be machined to a 
finish with a roughness value no greater than 250-µin. [6.4-µm] 
arithmetical average deviation (AA), terms as defined in ANSI 
B 46.1-1962, unless otherwise specified. 
5.4 Heat Treatment: 
5.4.1 All pipe of the grades shown in Table 1 other than 
FPA, FPB, FPl, FP2, FP12, FP91 Type 1 and Type 2, FP92, 
and FP115 shall be reheated and furnished in the full-annealed 
or normalized and tempered condition. If furnished in the 
normalized and tempered condition (Note 4), the temperature 
for tempering shall be 1250 °F [680 °C] or higher for Grades 
FPS, FP9, FP21, and FP22, and 1200 °F [650 °C] or higher for 
Grades FP36 and FPll. 
NoTE 4-It is recommended that the temperature for tempering should 
be at least 100 °F [50 °C] above the intended service temperature; 
consequently, the purchaser should advise the manufacturer if the service 
temperature is to be over ll00 0 P [600 °C]. 
578 
5.4.2 Pipe in Grades FPA and FPB as a final heat treatment 
shall be either normalized or shall be given a stress relieving 
treatment at 1200 to 1300 °F [650 to 705 °C]. Pipe in Grades 
FPl, FP2, and FP12, as a final heat treatment shall be given a 
stress-relieving treatment at 1200 to 1300 °F [650 to 705 °C). 
NoTE 5-Certain of the ferritic steels covered by this specification tend 
to harden if cooled rapidly from above their critical temperature. Some 
will air harden, that is, become hardened to an undesirable degree when 
cooled in air from high temperatures. Therefore, operations involving 
heating such steels above their critical temperatures, such as welding, 
hot-bending and other forming operations, should be followed by suitable 
heat treatment. 
5.4.3 Except when Supplementary Requirement S6 is speci­
fied by the purchaser, Grade FP91 Type 1 and Type 2 shall be 
normalized and tempered by reheating within the temperature 
range from 1900 to 1975 °F [1040 to 1080 °C), followed by air 
cooling and tempering in the temperature range of 1350 to 
1470 °F [730 to 800 °C). 
5.4.4 Except when Supplementary Requirement S6 is speci­
fied by the purchaser, Grade FP92 shall be normalized and 
tempered by reheating within the temperature range of 1900 to 
1975 °F [1040 to 1080 °C], followed by air cooling and 
tempering in the temperature range of 1350 to 1470 °F [730 to 
800 °C]. 
5.4.5 Grade FP115 shall be nonnalized and tempered by 
reheating within the temperature range of 1920 to 2010 °F 
[1050 to 1100 °C] and tempered in the range of 1380 to 1455 
°F [750 to 790 °C]. The rate of cooling at mid thickness from 
1650 to 900 °F [900 to 482 °C] shall be no slower than 9 
°F/minute [5 °C/minute]. 
5.5 Repair by Welding: 
5.5.1 Weld repair shall be pennitted only subject to the 
approval of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification 
A999/ A999M. 
5.5.2 All repair welds in FP91 shall be made with one of the 
following welding processes and consumables: SMAW, A5.5/ 
A5.5M E90XX-B9; SAW, A5.23/A5.23M EB9 + neutral flux; 
GTAW, A5.28/A5.28M ER90S-B9; and FCAW A5.29/A5.29M 
E91Tl-B9. In addition, the sum of the Ni+ Mn content of all 
welding consumables used to weld repair FP91 Type 1 and 
Type 2 shall not exceed 1.0 %. 
5.5.3 All repair welds in FP92 shall be made using welding 
consumables meeting the chemical requirements for the grade 
in Table 1. 
5.5.4 After weld repair, Grades FP91 Type 1 and Type 2 and 
FP92 shall be heat treated at 1350-1470 °F [730-800 °C). 
5.5.5 After weld repair, Grades FP115 shall be heat treated 
at 1345 to 1435 °F [730 to 780 °C). 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
7. Heat Analysis 
7.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the 
steel manufacturer to detennine the percentages of the ele­
ments specified. If secondary melting processes are employed, 
the heat analysis shall be obtained from one remelted ingot or 
the product of one remelted ingot of each primary melt. The
