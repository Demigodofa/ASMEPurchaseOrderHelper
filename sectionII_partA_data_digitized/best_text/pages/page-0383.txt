c Fittings made from forgings may have 0.35 max carbon and 0.35 max silicon with no minimum. 
° For each reduction of 0.01 % below the specified carbon maximum, an increase of 0.06 % manganese above the specified maximum will be permitted, up to a maximum 
of 1.65 %. 
E The sum of Copper, Nickel, Chromium, and Molybdenum shall not exceed 1.00 %. 
FApplies both to heat and product analyses. 
GColumbium (Cb) and Niobium (Nb) are alternate names for element 41 in the Periodic Table of the Elements. 
HChromium Nickel Balance is defined as CNB = (Cr+ 6Si + 4Mo + 1.5W + 11 V + 5Nb + 9Ti + 12AI) - (40C + 30N + 4Ni + 2Mn + 1 Cu) 
that covers the area from the weld bevel of the branch outlet to 
the center line of the body or run. Internal and external surfaces 
shall be examined when size permits accessibility. No cracks 
shall be permitted. Other imperfections shall be treated in 
accordance with Section 15 on Surface Finish, Appearance, 
and Corrosion Protection. After the removal of any crack, the 
tee(s) shall be re-examined by the original method. Acceptable 
tees shall be marked with the symbol PT or MT, as applicable, 
to indicate compliance. 
Norn 1-The examination described in 7.6 exists because the great 
bulk of cold-forming strain-induced imperfections are detected in the area 
described. Subsection 7.6 does not waive other areas of a tee from meeting 
the requirements of Section 15 on Surface Finish, Appearance, and 
Corrosion Protection. 
7.7 Stubends may be produced with the entire lap added by 
the welding of a ring, made from plate or bar of the same alloy 
grade and composition, to the outside of a straight section of 
pipe, provided the weld is double welded, is a full penetration 
joint, satisfies the requirements of 7 .3 for qualifications and 
8.3.4 for post weld heat treatment. 
8. Heat Treatment 
8.1 Heat Treatment Procedures-Fittings, after forming at 
an elevated temperature, shall be cooled to a temperature 
below the critical range under suitable conditions to prevent 
injurious defects caused by too rapid cooling, but in no case 
more rapidly than the cooling rate in still air. Heat treatment 
temperatures specified are metal (part) temperatures. Heat­
treated fittings shall be treated according to Section 7 in 
Specification A960/A960M. 
8.2 WPB, WPC, and WPR Fittings: 
8.2.1 Hot-formed WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings upon 
which the final forming operation is completed at a temperature 
above 1150 °F [620 °C] and below 1800 °F [980 °C] need not 
be heat treated provided they are cooled in still air. 
8.2.2 Hot-formed or forged WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings 
finished at temperature in excess of 1800 °F [980 °C] shall 
subsequently be annealed, normalized, or normalized and 
tempered. Hot-forged fittings NPS 4 or smaller need not be 
heat treated. 
8.2.3 WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings over NPS 12, produced 
by locally heating a portion of the fitting stock to any 
temperature for forming, shall be subsequently annealed, 
normalized, or normalized and tempered. Fittings such as 
elbows, tees, header tees, reducers and lap joint stub ends with 
a carbon content less than 0.26 %, NPS 12 and under, shall not 
require heat treatment after forming a locally heated portion of 
the fitting. 
8.2.4 Cold-formed WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings, upon 
which the final forming operation is completed at a temperature 
below 1150 °F [620 °C], shall be normalized, or shall be stress 
relieved at 1100 to 1275 °F [595 to 690 °C]. 
8.2.5 WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings produced by fusion 
welding and having a nominal wall thickness at the welded 
joint of¾ in. [19 mm] or greater shall be post-weld heat treated 
at 1100 to 1250 °F [595 to 675 °C], or in accordance with 8.2.6. 
8.2.6 At the option of the manufacturer, WPB and WPC 
fittings produced by any of the methods in Section 7 may be 
annealed, normalized, or normalized and tempered. 
8.3 Fittings Other than WPB, WPC, and WPR: 
8.3.1 Fittings of Grades WPl, WPll Class 1, WPll Class 2, 
WPll Class 3, WP12 Class 1, WP12 Class 2, WP22 Class 1, 
WP22 Class 3, WPS, and WP9 shall be furnished in the 
annealed, isothermal-annealed, or normalized and tempered 
condition. If normalized and tempered, the tempering tempera­
ture for WPll Class 1, WPll Class 2, WPll Class 3, WP12 
Class 1, and WP12 Class 2 shall not be less than 1150 °F [620 
°C]; for Grades WPS, WP9, WP22 Class 1, and WP22 Class 3 
the tempering temperature shall not be less than 1250 °F [675 
oc]. 
331 
8.3.2 Fittings of Grades WPl, WP12 Class 1, or WP12 
Class 2 either hot formed or cold formed may be given a final 
heat treatment at 1200 °F [650 °C] instead of the heat treatment 
specified in 8.3.1. 
8.3.3 Fittings of WP24 either hot formed or cold formed 
shall be furnished in the normalized and tempered condition. 
The normalizing temperature range shall be 1800 to 1975 °F 
[980 to 1080 °C]. The tempering temperature range shall be 
1350 to 1470 °F [730 to 800 °C]. 
8.3.4 Fittings in all thiclmesses produced by fusion welding 
after the heat treatment specified in 8.3.1 shall be post-weld 
heat treated at a temperature not less than prescribed above for 
tempering except that Grade WPl Type 1 and Type 2 are 
required to be post-weld heat treated only when the nominal 
wall thickness at the welded joint is ½ in. [13 mm] or greater, 
and except that preheat and post weld heat treatment are not 
required for WP24 fittings whose section thickness does not 
exceed 0.500 in. [12.7 mm]. 
8.3.5 Except when Supplementary Requirement Sl is speci­
fied by the purchaser, Grade WP91 Type 1 and Type 2 shall be 
normalized at 1900 °F [1040 °C] minimum, and 1975 °F [1080 
°C] maximum, and tempered in the temperature range of 1350 
°F [730 °C] to 1470 °F [800 °C] as a final heat treatment. 
8.3.6 Grade WP911 shall be normalized in the temperature 
range of 1900 to 1975 °F [1040 to 1080 °C], and tempered in 
the temperature range of 1365 to 1435 °F [740 to 780 °C] as a 
final heat treatment. 
8.3.7 Grade WP92 shall be normalized at 1900 °F [1040 °C] 
minimum, and 1975 °F [1080 °C] maximum, and tempered in
