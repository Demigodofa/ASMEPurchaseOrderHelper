3. Terminology 
3.1 Terminology A941 is applicable to this specification. 
Additional terms and wording more applicable to forgings are 
as noted in this section. 
3.2 Forging Definitions: 
3.2.1 steel forging, n-the product of a substantially com­
pressive plastic working operation that consolidates the mate­
rial and produces the desired shape. The plastic working may 
be performed by a hammer, press, forging machine, or ring 
rolling machine, and must deform the material to produce an 
essentially wrought structure. 
3.2.1.1 Discussion-Hot rolling operations may be used to 
produce blooms or billets for reforging. 
3.3 Forging Geometries: 
3.3.1 bar forging, n-forging that has no bore and having an 
axial length greater than its maximum cross sectional dimen­
sion. 
3.3.1.1 Discussion-More than one cross sectional shape or 
size may be included. Sometimes referred to as a solid forging. 
3.3.2 disk forging, n-forging, sometimes referred to as a 
pancake forging, that has (a) an axial length appreciably less 
than its diameter, (b) may be dished on one or both faces, and 
( c) final forging includes upsetting operations to reduce the 
height of the stock and increase its diameter. 
3.3.2.1 Discussion-Since much of the hot working is done 
in axially compressing the stock, the central area may not 
receive sufficient consolidation. To counter this effect, consid­
eration is usually given to the initial saddening (see 3.3.6) of 
the ingot or billet. 
3.3.3 hollow forging, n-forging (also known as a shell 
forging or a mandrel forging) in which (a) the axial length is 
equal to or greater than the diameter, and (b) the forging length 
and wall thickness are produced by hot working over a mandrel 
(usually water cooled) such that the bore diameter remains 
essentially the same as that of the mandrel. 
3.3.3.1 Discussion-Unless a hollow ingot has been used, 
the starting slug is hot trepanned or punched after upsetting and 
the bore diameter adjusted to suit the forging mandrel. The 
outside diameter may be contoured if required. The workpiece 
is forged between the upper die and lower dies while the 
mandrel is supported by cranes or manipulators to facilitate 
rotation. 
3.3.4 ring forging, n-type of hollow forging in which (a) 
the axial length is less than the diameter, (b) the wall thickness 
is reduced, and ( c) the outside diameter is increased by hot 
working between the top die and a mandrel supported on 
temporary saddles. 
3.3.4.1 Discussion-Forging between the top die and the 
mandrel enables the ring diameter to be increased while 
reducing the wall thickness, without increasing the axial 
length. 
3.3.5 ring rolling, n-involves the use of specialized equip­
ment whereby a hot punched, trepanned, or bored disk is ( a) 
hot worked between a powered outer roller and an idling inner 
roller, such that the wall thickness is reduced and the outside 
diameter is increased, and (b) the axial length of the ring is not
