A Determined by either the 0.2 % offset method or the 0.5 % extension-under-load method. 
8 See Specification A20/A20M for elongation adjustment. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and 
shall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of 
Specification A20/A20M. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 Grade D plates of all thicknesses and Grade C plates of 
thicknesses over 2 in. [50 mm] shall be normalized. 
5.2 Grade C plates 2 in. [50 mm] and under in thickness are 
usually supplied in the as-rolled condition. The plates may be 
ordered normalized or stress-relieved, or both. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements 
given in Table 1, unless otherwise modified in accordance with 
313 
Supplementary Requirement Sl7, Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized 
Steel, in Specification A20/ A20M. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7 .1 Tension Test-The plates, as represented by the tension 
test specimens, shall conform to the requirements given in 
Table 2. 
7.2 For plates with a nominal thickness of% in. [20 mm] 
and under, the 1 ½-in. [40-mm] wide rectangular specimen may 
be used and the elongation determined in a 2-in. [50-mm] gage 
length that includes the fracture and that shows the greatest 
elongation.
