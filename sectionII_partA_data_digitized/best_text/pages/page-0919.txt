7.3.2.2 Process annealing shall consist of completing hot 
working above the minimum annealing temperature required 
for each grade as indicated in Table 2, and cooling rapidly 
enough to prevent unacceptable precipitation of intermetallic 
phases. 
7.4 Ferritic Grades-Ferritic grades shall be annealed to 
meet their respective mechanical testing requirements as 
shown in the applicable product specification. 
7.5 Martensitic Grades: 
7.5.1 All martensitic grades shall be supplied in either the 
annealed condition or in the tempered condition as specified by 
the purchaser. Tempered material shall be normalized, or shall 
be liquid quenched from 1700 °F [925 °C], minimum, fol­
lowed by tempering in accordance with 7.5.2, 7.5.3, or 7.5.4. 
7.5.2 Types 403 and 410 tempered material shall be held at 
the tempering temperature for at least 1 h/in. [25.4 mm] of 
cross section as follows: 
7.5.2.1 Condition 1-1250 °F [675 °C] minimum; 1400 °F 
[760 °C] maximum. 
7.5.2.2 Condition 2-1100 °F [595 °C] minimum, 1400 °F 
[760 °C] maximum. 
7.5.2.3 Condition 3-1050 °F [565 °C] minimum, 1400 °F 
[760 °C] maximum. 
7.5.3 Types XM-30, 414, and 431 tempered materials shall 
be held at 1100 °F [595 °C], minimum for at least 1 h/in. 
[25 mm] of cross section. Maximum tempering temperature 
shall be 1400 °F [7 60 °C]. 
7.5.4 S41500 shall be heated to 1750 °F [955 °C] minimum, 
air cooled to 200 °F [95 °C] or lower prior to any optional 
intermediate temper and prior to the final temper. The final 
temper shall be between 1050 and 1150 °F [565 and 620 °C]. 
7.5.5 When the purchaser elects to perform the hardening 
and tempering heat treatment, martensitic materials shall be 
supplied by the manufacturer in the annealed condition (see 
7.5.1). In this case the purchaser shall be responsible to apply 
the proper heat treatment and to conduct the tests deemed 
necessary to assure that the required properties are obtained. 
8. Finish 
8.1 The following types of finishes are permitted, as appli­
cable to the product ordered: 
8.1.1 Hot-finished Bars-Hot-finished bars shall have the 
surface finish that results from hot processing, with or without 
certain additional surface modification. Hot-finished bars are 
commonly produced by hot rolling, forging, pressing, 
extruding, or similar hot working procedures applied to ingots, 
blooms, or billets. The resulting products are typically subject 
to various additional operations affecting the surface of the 
bars, including but not limited to one or more of the following: 
annealing or other heat treatment; cleaning by blasting, 
pickling, or other descaling methods; rough turning; and 
machine straightening. The producer is permitted to use 
centerless grinding, polishing, or other operations commonly 
associated with cold finishing in order to provide improved 
dimensional tolerances or surface condition for the hot-finished 
bar. The dimensional tolerances applicable to hot-finished bars 
are less stringent than those applicable to cold-finished bars. 
8.1.2 Bars Cut from Strip or Plate-Bars cut from flat-rolled 
stainless steel products shall have two surfaces that are pickled 
or descaled, and two cut surfaces, except when the bar is heat 
treated subsequent to cutting, in which case all surfaces shall 
be descaled or pickled. 
8.1.3 Cold-finished Bar-Cold-finished bars shall have the 
surface finish that results from hot-finished bars being further 
processed by additional mechanical operations on the surface 
of the bar, including but not limited to light cold drawing, 
burnishing, centerless grinding, and polishing to provide closer 
tolerances and improved surface finish. The dimensional tol­
erances applicable to cold-finished bars are more stringent than 
those applicable to hot-finished bars. 
8.1.4 Bars and Billets or Other Semi-finished Material for 
Reforging-Material intended for reforging shall be delivered 
in the hot-finished condition or in the cold-drawn condition. 
The cold-drawn condition alternative is only permitted for 
austenitic and austenitic-ferritic stainless steel forgings. When 
delivered in the hot-finished condition, it is permitted to 
condition the surface by removing surface defects provided 
that the depth of the conditioning does not exceed that which 
affects the surface condition or dimensions of the article to be 
forged from the bar or billet. When delivered in the cold-drawn 
condition, it is permitted to hot forge forgings from cold-drawn 
bar provided this bar has been cold-drawn from material in the 
solution-annealed condition. 
8.1.5 Shapes-Shapes shall be descaled by machining, 
grinding, blasting, or pickling. 
8.1.5.1 Shapes shall be subject to either Class A or Class C 
surface preparation as specified on the purchase order. Class A 
consists of grinding for the removal of imperfections of a 
hazardous nature, such as fins, tears, and jagged edges, 
provided the underweight tolerance is not exceeded and the 
maximum depth of grinding at any one point does not exceed 
10 % of the thickness of the section. Class C consists of 
grinding for the removal of all visible surface imperfections, 
provided that the underweight tolerance is not exceeded and 
the maximum depth of grinding at any point does not exceed 
10 % of the thickness of the section. 
8.1.6 Forgings-Forgings shall be descaled by machining, 
blasting, or pickling. The selection of the descaling methods 
shall be at the option of the producer unless a particular 
descaling method is specified in the purchase order.

9. Dimensions, Mass, and Permissible Variations 
9.1 Unless otherwise specified on the purchase order, the 
material shall conform to the permitted variations in dimen­
sions as specified in the following: 
9.1.1 Bars-Tables 3-12. 
9.1.2 Shapes-Tables 13-19 and Figs. 1 and 2. 
9.1.3 Forgings-As specified in the purchase order, or in 
prints or sketches accompanying the purchase order. 
9.1.4 Billets or Other Semi-finished Material for 
Reforging-Billets and other semi-finished material shall con­
form to the shape and dimensions specified by the purchaser 
within a permitted variation of ±5 %.
