SA-693 (ASTM A693) ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 
a Designation: A693 - 22 
~u II 
INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Precipitation-Hardening Stainless and Heat-Resisting Steel 
Plate, Sheet, and Strip 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A693; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year of 
original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A 
superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers precipitation-hardening stain­
less steel plate, sheet, and strip. The mechanical properties of 
these steels are developed by suitable low-temperature heat 
treatments generally referred to as precipitation hardening. 
1.2 These steels are used for parts requiring corrosion 
resistance and high strength at room temperature or at tem­
peratures up to 600 °F (315 °C). Some of these steels are 
particularly suitable for moderate to severe drawing and 
forming in the solution-treated condition. Others are capable of 
mild forming only. They are suitable for machining in the 
solution-annealed condition, after which they may be hardened 
to the mechanical properties specified in this standard without 
danger of cracking or distortion. 
1.3 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as the standard. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements 
3.1 The following requirements for orders for material 
furnished under this specification shall conform to the appli­
cable requirements of the current edition of Specification 
A480/A480M or as specified in the following: 
3.1.1 Ordering Information: 
3.1.1.1 In addition to the requirements of Specification 
A480/A480M, the heat treatment (see Section 6) shall be 
specified on the purchase order if other than the solution­
annealed condition is being ordered. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel shall be melted by one of the following 
processes: 
4.1.1 Electric furnace (with separate degassing and refining 
optional), 
4.1.2 Vacuum furnace, and 
4.1.3 One of the former followed by: 
4.1.3.1 Consumable remelting in vacuum, inert gas, or 
electroslag, or 
4.1.3.2 Electron beam refining. 
4.1.4 Other commercial melting methods as agreed upon 
between purchaser and seller are acceptable. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition specified in Table 1, and shall conform 
to applicable requirements specified in the current edition of 
Specification A480/ A480M.
