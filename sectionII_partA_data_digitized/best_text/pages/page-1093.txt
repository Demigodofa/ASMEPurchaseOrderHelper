ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-568/SA-568M (ASTM A568/A568M) 
TABLE A1.2 Thickness Tolerances of Hot-Rolled Sheet (High­
Strength, Low-Alloy Steel)-15-mm (Cut Edge) and 25-mm (Mill 
Edge) Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut Lengths, Including 
Pickled) 
NOTE I-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less 
than 15 mm from a cut edge and not less than 25 mm from a mill edge. 
This table does not apply to the uncropped ends of mill edge coils. 
NOTE 2-Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be 
constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 
0.188 in. [4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the 
anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 
in. [2.55 mm]. Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness 
measurements. 
NoTE 3-This table was constructed by multiplying the values in the 
standard table by 0.75 and rounding to 2 decimal places using standard 
ASTM practice. 
NoTE 4--The thickness of material <50 mm wide shall be measured at 
mid-width.

A The specified thickness range captions apply independent of whether the 
ordered thickness is stated as a nominal or minimum. 
8 The tolerances provided in the table are based on minimum thickness (tolerance 
over, not tolerance under). For nominal thickness, the tolerance is divided equally 
over and under. 
0 Where an ellipsis ( ... ) appears in the table, the requirements have not been 
defined.
