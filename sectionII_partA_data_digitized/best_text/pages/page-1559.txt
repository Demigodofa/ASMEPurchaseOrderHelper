Al. BAKE HARDENABLE STEELS 
Al.1 Determination of Bake Hardening Index 
Al .1.1 The bake hardening index (BHI) is determined by a 
two-step procedure using a standard longitudinal (rolling 
direction) tensile-test specimen, prepared in accordance with 
Test Methods and Definitions A370. The test specimen is first 
strained in tension. The magnitude of this tensile "pre-strain" 
shall be 2 % (extension under load). The test specimen is then 
removed from the test machine and baked at a temperature of 
340 °F [170 °C] for a period of 20 min. Referring to Fig. Al.I, 
the bake hardening index (BHI) of the material is calculated as 
follows: 
BHI= B-A (Al.1) 
where: 
A = flow stress at 2 % extension under load, and 
B = yield strength [upper yield strength (Bu) or lower yield 
strength (BL)] after baking at 340 °F [170 °C] for 
20 min. 
Al.1.2 The original test specimen cross section (width and 
thickness) is used in the calculation of all engineering strengths 
in this test. 
Al.1.3 The pre-straining of 2 % in tension is intended to 
simulate a modest degree of forming strain, while the subse­
quent baking is intended to simulate a paint-curing or similar 
treatment. In the production of actual parts, forming strains and 
baking treatments can differ from those employed here, and as 
a result, final properties can differ from the values obtained 
under these controlled conditions.
