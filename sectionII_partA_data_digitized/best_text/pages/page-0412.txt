3. Ordering Information 
3.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material welded tubes (WLD) or heavily cold 
worked tubes (HCW), 
3.1.3 Grade (Table 1), 
3.1.4 Size (outside diameter and nominal wall thickness), 
3.1.5 Length (specific or random), 
3.1.6 Optional requirements (13.6), 
3.1.7 Test report required (see Certification Section of 
Specification A1016/A1016M), 
3.1.8 Specification designation, and 
3.1.9 Special requirements and any supplementary require­
ments selected. 
3.1.9.1 If Supplementary Requirement S7 is specified, in­
clude weld decay ratio per S 11.1.1. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A1016/Al016M, unless otherwise provided 
herein. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 The welded (WLD) tubes shall be made from flat-rolled 
steel by an automatic welding process with no addition of filler 
metal. 
5.1.l Subsequent to welding and prior to final heat 
treatment, the tubes shall be cold worked either in both weld 
and base metal or in weld metal only. The method of cold 
working may be specified by the purchaser. When cold drawn, 
the purchaser may specify the minimum amount of reduction in 
cross-sectional area or wall thickness, or both. 
5.1.2 Heavily cold worked (HCW) tubes shall be made by 
applying cold working of not less than 35 % reduction in both 
wall and weld to a welded tube prior to the final anneal. No 
filler metal shall be used in the making of the weld. Prior to 
cold working, the weld shall be 100 % radiographically in­
spected in accordance with the requirements of ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1, latest 
revision, Paragraph UW 51. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 All material shall be furnished in the heat-treated 
condition in accordance with the requirements of Table 2. 
6.2 A solution annealing temperature above 1950 °F [1065 
0 C] may impair the resistance to intergranular corrosion after 
subsequent exposure to sensitizing conditions in TP309HCb, 
TP310HCb, TP321, TP321H, TP347, TP347H, TP348, and 
TP348H. When specified by the purchaser, a lower temperature 
stabilization or re-solution anneal shall be used subsequent to 
the initial high temperature solution anneal (see Supplementary 
Requirement S4). 
6.3 N08020 shall be supplied in the stabilization treatment 
condition. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The heat analysis shall conform to the requirements as 
to chemical composition given in Table 1. 
8. Product Analysis 
8.1 An analysis of either one length of flat-rolled stock or 
one tube shall be made for each heat. The chemical composi­
tion thus determined shall conform to the requirements given in 
Section 7. 
8.2 A product analysis tolerance of Table Al.I in Specifi­
cation A480/ A480M shall apply. The product analysis toler­
ance is not applicable to the carbon content for material with a 
specified maximum carbon of 0.04 % or less. 
8.3 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be 
made. Both retests for the elements in question shall meet the 
requirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot (See 13.9.1) shall be rejected or, at 
the option of the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or 
tube may be individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of 
flat-rolled stock or tubes that do not meet the requirements of 
the specification shall be rejected.

9. Tensile Requirements 
9 .1 The material shall conform to the tensile properties 
prescribed in Table 3. 
10. Hardness Requirements 
10.1 The tubes shall have a Rockwell hardness number not 
exceeding the values specified in Table 3. 
10.2 For tubing less than 0.354 in. [9.00 mm] in inside 
diameter and for tubing less than 0.065 in. [1.65 mm] in wall 
thickness, it is permissible to use the Vickers hardness test in 
lieu of the Rockwell test. Tubes shall have a Vickers hardness 
number not exceeding the values specified in Table 3. 
11. Reverse-Bend Test Requirement 
11.1 A section 4 in. [100 mm] minimum in length shall be 
split longitudinally 90° on each side of the weld. The sample 
shall then be opened and bent around a mandrel with a 
maximum thickness of four times the wall thickness, with the 
mandrel parallel to the weld and against the original outside 
surface of the tube. The weld shall be at the point of maximum 
bend. There shall be no evidence of cracks, or of overlaps 
resulting from the reduction in thickness of the weld areas by 
cold working. When the geometry or size of the tubing make it
