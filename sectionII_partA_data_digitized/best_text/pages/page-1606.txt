ANNEX 
(Mandatory Information) 
Al. ROUNDING OF TEST DATA 
Al.1 Application 
Al.1.1 This annex shall apply to rounding test data for the 
purpose of determining conformance to product specification 
requirements. 
Al.2.3 Requirements for rounding levels for determining 
conformance to product specification requirements are given in 
Table Al. 1. Specific reported test data values shall be rounded 
to Table Al. 1 for determining conformance to product speci­
fication requirements. Al.1.1.1 This annex shall apply only when rounding is not 
specified in the product specifications. 
Al.1.1.2 Observed or calculated test results and records 
maintained by testing laboratories are not subject to this annex. 
Al.2 Method 
Al.2.4 Table Al.1 values are designed to provide unifor­
mity in determining conformance to product specification 
requirements and should be considered when rounding require­
ments are stated in product specifications. 
Al.2.1 Values shall be rounded in accordance with the rules 
of Practice E29 unless otherwise stated herein. 
A 1.2.2 In the special case of rounding the number "5" when 
no additional numbers other than "ff' follow the "5," rounding 
shall be in accordance with Practice E29 except where this 
would result in rejection of the. product. 
Al.2.5 When rounding requirements for product acceptance 
are neither stated in the product specification nor listed in Table 
Al.1, an observed or calculated value shall be rounded to the 
nearest unit in the last right hand digit used in expressing the 
specification requirement.

A Round test data to the nearest integral multiple to the nearest values in this column. If the data value Is exactly midway between two rounded values, round in accordance 
with A 1.2.2.
