A Regardless of wall location, that is midwall ½, innermost½, or outermost½. 
8 Each indication that equals or exceeds the 0.5 in. [18 mm] reference line shall be traced to the posi­
tion where the indication is equal to b.25 in. [6 mml The area of the location, for the purpose of this 
evaluation, shall be considered the area that is confined within the outline established by the center of 
the transducer during tracing of the flaw as required. Whenever no discernible surface tracing is possi­
ble, each indication which equals or exceeds the 0.5 in. reference amplitude shall be considered 
0.15 in. 2 [l cm 2 J (three times the area of the ¾ diameter [6 mm] flat bottomed hole to compensate for 
reflectivity degradation of natural flaw) for the cumulative area estimates. 
c The indications within a cluster with the cumulative areas traced shall be dispersed in a minimum sur­
face area of the casting equal to 36 in. 2 [230 cm 2 J. If the cumulative areas traced are confined with a 
smaller area of distribution, the area shall be repair welded to the extent necessary to meet the applica­
ble quality level.

NOTE 1 - For each increase in thickness of 2 in. [50 mm], or a fraction thereof, the hole diameter shall 
increase ½_ 6 in. Cl.6 mml 
NOTE 2 - For block sizes over 3 in. [75 mm] in thickness, T, the distance from the hole to the end of the 
block shal I be ½ T, min, to prevent coincident reflections from the hole and the corner. Block fabricated 
with a 2 in. [50 mm] minimum dimension need not be modified if the corner and hole indications can be 
easily resolved.
