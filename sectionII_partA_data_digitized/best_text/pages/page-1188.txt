INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Electric-Fusion-Welded Steel Pipe for Atmospheric and 
Lower Temperatures 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A671 / A671M; the number inunediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers electric-fusion-welded steel 
pipe with filler metal added, fabricated from pressure vessel 
quality plate of several analyses and strength levels and 
suitable for high-pressure service at atmospheric and lower 
temperatures. Heat treatment may or may not be required to 
attain the desired properties or to comply with applicable code 
requirements. Supplementary requirements are provided for 
use when additional testing or examination is desired. 
1.2 The specification nominally covers pipe 16 in. [400 
mm] in outside diameter or larger and of¼ in. [6 mm] wall 
thickness or greater. Pipe having other dimensions may be 
furnished provided it complies with all other requirements of 
this specification. 
1.3 Several grades and classes of pipe are provided. 
1.3.1 Grade designates the type of plate used as listed in 5.1. 
1.3.2 Class designates the type of heat treatment performed 
during manufacture of the pipe, whether the weld is radio­
graphically examined, and whether the pipe has been pressure 
tested as listed in 1.3.3. 
1.3.3 Class designations are as follows (Note 1):

NoTE ]-Selection of materials should be made with attention to 
temperature of service. For such guidance, Specification A20/ A20M may 
be consulted. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
