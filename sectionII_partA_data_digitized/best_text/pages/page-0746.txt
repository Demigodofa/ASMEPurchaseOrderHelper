TENSION TEST 
FIG. 1 Location of Test Specimens 
6.1.2.1 Tensile test samples shall be taken from the full 
thickness of the sheet as rolled. 
6.1.2.2 Tensile test specimens shall be taken from a location 
approximately halfway between the center of the sheet and the 
edge of the material as-rolled. 
6.1.2.3 Tensile test specimens shall be taken with the axis of 
the test specimen perpendicular to the rolling direction (trans­
verse test). 
6.1.3 Test Method-Yield strength shall be determined by 
either the 0.2 % offset method or by the 0.5 % extension under 
load method, unless otherwise specified per Test Method A370. 
6.2 Impact Properties: 
6.2.1 Requirements-At the time of order, Charpy impact 
properties may be specified by the purchaser for Grade H only. 
6.2.1.1 Impact energy minimums and testing temperatures 
shall be agreed upon between the producer and the purchaser. 
6.2.2 Number of Tests-Three samples taken in the trans­
verse direction shall be taken at mid-length (middle) of each 
coil to be certified. 
6.2.3 Testing shall be in accordance with Test Method 
A370.

7. General Requirements for Delivery 
7.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A568/A568M or Specification A635/A635M un­
less otherwise provided herein. 
8. Workmanship 
8.1 The material shall be free from injurious defects (see 
Specifications A568/A568M or A635/A635M, as appropriate 
due to thickness). 
9. Finish and Appearance 
9.1 Surface Finish: 
9 .1.1 Unless otherwise specified, the material shall be fur­
nished without removing the hot-rolled oxide or scale. 
9.1.2 When required, the material may be specified to be 
pickled or blast cleaned. 
9.2 Oiling: 
9.2.1 Unless otherwise specified, the material shall be fur­
nished not oiled. 
9.2.2 When specified to be pickled or blast cleaned, the 
material shall be furnished oiled. When required, pickled or 
blast-cleaned material may be specified to be furnished dry. 
9.3 Edges-Unless otherwise specified, mill edges shall be 
furnished on material that has not had the hot-rolled oxide or 
scale removed and cut edges shall be furnished on material that 
has had the hot-rolled oxide or scale removed. 
10. Certification and Reports 
10.1 The manufacturer or processor shall furnish copies of a 
test report showing the results of the heat analysis and 
mechanical property tests made to deternrine compliance with 
this specification. 
10.2 The report shall include the purchase order number, the 
specification number and year date, product designation, grade, 
the heat number, and heat analysis and mechanical properties 
as indicated by the tension test. 
10.2.1 All the mechanical properties from the coil used to 
qualify the lot and the middle test from the particular coil shall 
be reported along with the coil identification for that coil. If the
