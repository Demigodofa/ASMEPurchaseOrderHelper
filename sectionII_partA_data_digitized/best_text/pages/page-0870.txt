SA-476/SA-476M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR DUCTILE IRON CASTINGS FOR 
PAPER MILL DRYER ROLLS 
SA-476/SA-476M 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 476/ A 476M-00(2018) except for editorial changes in 4.1.6 and 13.1 to make certification mandatory.] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers ductile iron castings for 
use in pressure containing paper mill dryer rolls at tempera­
tures up to 450°F [230°C]. 
1.2 No precise quantitative relationship can be stated 
between the properties of the iron in various locations of 
the same casting or between the properties of a casting 
and those of a test specimen cast from the same iron (see 
Appendix Xl). 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification.

are found in Terminology A 644. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 Orders for material purchased to the requirements of 
this specification should include the following information: 
768 
4.1.1 Quantity, 
4.1.2 Specification number and date of issue, 
4.1.3 Description of casting by pattern number or 
drawing, 
4.1.4 Heat treatment, if required (see 5.1), 
4.1.5 Type of test coupon (see 9.2), 
4.1.6 Certification, is required (see 13.1), 
4.1.7 Marking location (see 14.1), and 
4.1.8 Additional requirements. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 The castings may be stress relieved at a temperature 
not to exceed 1200°F [650°C]. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 The castings shall conform to the following chemi­
cal requirements: 
Total carbon, min, % 
Silicon, max, % 
Phosphorus, max, % 
Sulfur, max,% 
3.0 
3.0 
0.08 
0.05 
6.2 The castings shall have a carbon equivalent of 3.8 
to 4.5 inclusive. 
NOTE 1 - The carbon content equivalent is calculated as follows: 
Total carbon + 0.3 (silicon + phosphorus) 
6.3 The chemical analysis for total carbon shall be 
made on either chilled cast pencil-type specimens or on 
thin wafers approximately ½ 2 in. [0.8 mm] thick, cut from 
test coupons. Drillings shall not be used due to attendant 
loss of graphite.
