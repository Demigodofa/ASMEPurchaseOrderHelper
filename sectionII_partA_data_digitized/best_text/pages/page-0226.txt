16. Dimensions, Mass, and Permissible Variations 
16.1 Mass-The mass of any length of pipe shall not vary 
more than 10 % over and 3.5 % under that specified. Unless 
otherwise agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser, pipe in NPS 4 [DN 100] and smaller may be 
weighed in convenient lots; pipe larger than NPS 4 [DN 100] 
shall be weighed separately. 
16.2 Diameter-Except as provided for thin-wall pipe in 
paragraph 12.2 of Specification A530/A530M, the tolerances 
for diameter shall be in accordance with the following: 
16.2.l Except for pipe ordered as special outside diameter 
tolerance pipe or as inside diameter tolerance pipe, variations 
in outside diameter shall not exceed those given in Table 3. 
16.2.2 For pipe over 10 in. [250 mm] OD ordered as special 
outside diameter tolerance pipe, the outside diameter shall not 
vary more than 1 % over or 1 % under the specified outside 
diameter. 
16.2.3 For pipe over 10 in. [250 mm] ID ordered as inside 
diameter tolerance pipe, the inside diameter shall not vary 
more than 1 % over or l % under the specified inside diameter. 
16.3 Thickness-The minimum wall thickness at any point 
shall not be more than 12.5 % under the specified wall 
thickness. 
17. Lengths 
17 .1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following 
regular practice: 
17 .1.1 The lengths required shall be specified in the order, 
and 
17 .1.2 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise specified. 
17 .1.3 If definite lengths are not required, pipe may be 
ordered in single random lengths or in double random lengths 
meeting the following requirements: 
17.1.3.1 Single random lengths shall be 16 to 22 ft [4.8 to 
6.7 m] in length, except that 5 % shall be permitted to be less 
than 16 ft [4.8 m] and none shall be less than 12 ft [3.7 m]. 
17.1.3.2 Double random lengths shall have a minimum 
average length of 35 ft [10.7 m] and shall have a minimum 
length of 22 ft [6.7 m], except that 5 % shall be permitted to be 
less than 22 ft [6.7 m] and none shall be less than 16 ft [4.8 m].

18. Workmanship, Finish and Appearance 
18.1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient num­
ber of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable 
assurance that they have been properly evaluated with respect 
to depth. Exploration of all surface imperfections is not 
required but consideration should be given to the necessity of 
exploring all surface imperfections to assure compliance with 
18.2. 
18.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 12½ % 
of the nominal wall thickness or encroach on the minimum 
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with such 
defects shall be given one of the following dispositions: 
18.2.1 The defect shall be removed by grinding, provided 
that the remaining wall thickness is within the limits specified 
in 16.3. 
18.2.2 Repaired in accordance with the repair welding 
provisions of 18.6. 
18.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect may be cut 
off within the limits of requirements on length. 
18.2.4 Rejected. 
18.3 To provide a workmanlike finish and basis for evalu­
ating conformance with 18.2 the pipe manufacturer shall 
remove by grinding the following noninjurious imperfections: 
18.3.1 Mechanical marks and abrasions-such as cable 
marks, dinges, guide marks, roll marks, ball scratches, scores, 
and die marks-and pits, any of which imperfections are 
deeper than 1/16 in. [l.6 mm]. 
174 
18.3.2 Visual imperfections commonly referred to as scabs, 
seams, laps, tears, or slivers found by exploration in accor­
dance with 18.1 to be deeper than 5 % of the nominal wall 
thickness. 
18.4 At the purchaser's discretion, pipe shall be subjected to 
rejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 18.2 are not 
scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is 
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall 
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
18.5 When imperfections or defects are removed by 
grinding, a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the 
wall thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by 
this specification. The outside diamet()r at the point of grinding 
is permitted to be reduced by the amount so removed. 
18.5.1 Wall thickness measurements shall be made with a 
mechanical caliper or with a properly calibrated nondestructive 
testing device of appropriate accuracy. In case of dispute, the 
measurement determined by use of the mechanical caliper shall 
govern. 
18.6 Weld repair shall be permitted only subject to the 
approval of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification 
A530/A530M. 
18.7 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight. 
19. End Finish 
19.1 The Pipe shall be furnished to the following practice, 
unless otherwise specified.
