methods, finish, thread dimensions, macroetch (Grade B4D 
only), marking, certification, optional supplementary 
requirements, and others. Failure to comply with the require­
ments of Specification A962/A962M constitutes nonconfor­
mance with this specification. In case of conflict between this 
specification and Specification A962/ A962M, this specification 
shall prevail. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 Grades B4B and B4C shall be heated to a temperature 
range of 1875 to 1925 °F [1025 to 1050 °C] and liquid 
quenched to below 600 °F [316 °C]. The material Grades B4B 
and B4C shall then be uniformly reheated for tempering at a 
tempering temperature at least 100 °F [55 °C] higher than the 
proposed operating temperature but not less than 1150 °F [620 
0 C], then air or furnace cooled to room temperature. The 
material shall be at the tempering temperature for a minimum 
of 2 h. Double tempering may be used to enhance properties. 
5.2 Grade B4D shall be heated to a temperature range of 
1700 to 1750 °F [925 to 954 °C] and oil quenched. The 
material shall then be uniformly reheated or tempered at a 
temperature of 1200 °F [650 °C] minimum, followed by air or 
furnace cooling to room temperature. 
5.3 Stress relieving treatment of the bar material is required 
after any stretcher, roller, or rotary-straightening or cold­
finishing operations performed after heat treatment for me­
chanical properties. Local gagging or press straightening to 
conect camber limitations in excess of¼ in. in any 5 ft [6 mm 
in any 1.5 m] shall be followed by a stress relieving heat 
treatment. The minimum stress relieving temperature shall be 
100 °F [55 °C] below the minimum tempering temperature as 
shown in 5.1 for Grades B4B and B4C or in 5.2 for Grade 
B4D. 
6. Chemical Composition

7. Tensile Requirements 
7.1 Bolting material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in Table 2 at room temperature 
after heat treatment. 
7 .2 The longitudinal axis of the test specimen shall be 
parallel to the direction of rolling. 
8. Impact Requirements 
8.1 Grades B4B, B4C, and B4D shall conform to the 
requirements as to impact properties prescribed in Table 3 at 
room temperature after heat treatment. 
9. Hardness Tests 
9.1 Grades B4B, B4C, and B4D shall conform to the 
requirements as to hardness as prescribed in Table 4 and Table 
5 at room temperature after heat treatment. 
10. Nuts 
10.1 When specified by the purchaser, nuts shall be subject 
to the impact and tension requirements of this specification. 
The tests shall be made on test specimens taken from the bar or 
plate used in the manufacture of the nuts. 
11. Threads 
11.1 All threads shall be formed after heat treatment. 
12. Nondestructive Inspection 
12.1 Each bar or forged blank of starting material shall be 
subjected to NDE following final heat treatment. The method 
used shall be either the Eddy Current (EC), the Magnetic 
Pmiicle (MPI) (wet or dry), the Liquid Penetrant (LPI), the 
Ultrasonic (UT), or the Visual Testing (VT), at the option of the 
producer. For LPI or MPI, linear indications (those indications 
longer than 1/16 in. [l.5 mm] with a length greater than three 
times their width) are unacceptable. For UT or ET, reject levels 
for linear indications shall be based on the alarm response from 
a surface notch with a maximum depth of 0.012 in. [0.30 mm] 
in a calibration bar. Product being subjected to VT shall be 
pickled prior to inspection. VT indications longer than 1/8 in. 
[3.2 mm] are prohibited.
