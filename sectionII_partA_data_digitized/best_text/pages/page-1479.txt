ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-962/SA-962M 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall be applied only when specified by 
the purchaser in the purchase order or contract. The specified supplementary requirements shall be 
completed prior to shipment of the product. 
SSO. Product Marking 
S50.1 Grade and manufacturer's identification symbols 
shall be applied to one end of studs and to the heads of bolts of 
all sizes. If the available area is inadequate, the grade symbol 
may be marked on one end and the manufacturer's identifica­
tion symbol marked on the other end. 
SSl. Stress Relieving 
S51.1 A stress relieving operation shall follow straightening 
after heat treatment. The minimum stress relieving temperature 
shall be 100 °F [55 °C] below the tempering temperature. Tests 
for mechanical properties shall be performed after stress 
relieving. 
SS2. Heat Analysis 
S52.1 An analysis of each remelt ingot shall be made by the 
steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of those 
elements specified in the individual product specification. The 
chemical analysis thus determined shall conform to the require­
ments of the individual product specification. 
SS3. Sequential or Continuous Strand Casting 
S53.l When multiple heats of the same chemical compo­
sition range are sequentially strand cast, the heats shall be 
separated by an established procedure such that intermix 
material shall not be supplied. 
SS4. Bolting for Dynamic Service 
S54.1 Bolting for dynamic service shall be examined for 
surface discontinuities and decarburization. 
S54.2 Surface Discontinuities: 
S54.2.1 The surface discontinuities shall conform to Speci­
fication F788 and the additional limitations in S54.2.2. 
S54.2.2 Thread lap inspection shall be performed in accor­
dance with Specification F788 Supplementary Requirement 
S50. The threads shall have no laps at the root, or on the flanks 
initiating or extending below the pitch line. 
S54.2.3 Quench cracks of any depth, any length, or in any 
location are not permitted. 
S54.2.4 Folds at the junction of the head and the shank are 
not permitted. 
S54.3 Decarburization: 
S54.3.l Decarburization tests shall be conducted as follows, 
with the same number of tests as the tension test: 
S54.3.2 Section the thread area longitudinally through the 
axis, and mount and polish the cut face in accordance with 
Practice E3. Use either optical or microhardness measurements 
for decarburization. In case of dispute, the microhardness 
method shall be used. 
S54.3.3 For optical measurement, etch the metallographic 
section in 4 % Nital. Examine the surface of the etched sample 
under a microscope at 1 OOx using a measuring eyepiece 
graduated in 0.001 in. [0.03 mm] increments, or on a ground 
glass screen or photomicrograph. There shall be no gross 
decarburization (clearly defined ferrite grains), and the depth of 
partial decarburization (light etching zone) anywhere below the 
pitch line shall be less than 5 % of the nominal thread height. 
S54.3.4 For microhardness measurement, make hardness 
tests in accordance with Test Method E384 on unetched 
metallographic sections using either a DPH 136° indenter and 
a 200-gf load, or a Knoop indenter and a 200-gf load. Take 
measurements at the minor diameter on the thread crest 
bisector to determine the base metal hardness. On the same or 
an adjacent thread, take measurements within 0.003 in. [0.08 
mm] of the flank surface at the pitch line, and 0.003 in. [0.08 
mm] below the thread root. These two hardness readings shall 
be equal to or greater than the base metal hardness minus 30 
DPHorKHN. 
SSS. Magnetic Particle Examination 
S55.1 The wet fluorescent magnetic particle examination 
method shall be applied to 100 % of the lot in accordance with 
Practice E1444/E1444M. Acceptance criteria shall be in accor­
dance with S57. 
SS6. Liquid Penetrant Examination 
S56.1 The fluorescent liquid penetrant examination method 
shall be applied to 100 % of the lot in accordance with Practice 
E1417/E1417M. Acceptance criteria shall be in accordance 
with S57. 
SS7. Acceptance Criteria 
S57.1 Only indications, which have a dimension greater 
than 1/16 in., shall be considered relevant. A linear indication is 
one having a length greater than three times the width. A 
rounded indication is one of circular or elliptical shape with a 
length equal to or less than three times the width. All surfaces 
examined shall be free of the following: 
S57 .1.1 Relevant linear indications; 
S57.l.2 Relevant rounded indications greater than 3/16 in.; 
and, 
S57.l.3 Four or more relevant rounded indications in a line 
separated by 1/16 in. or less, edge to edge. 
SSS. Positive Material Identification Examination 
S58.l Bolting shall receive Positive Material Identification 
to ensure that the purchaser is receiving bolting of the correct 
material grade prior to shipment of the bolting. This examina­
tion is a method to assure that no material grade mix-up has 
happened during manufacturing and marking of bolting. 
S58.2 Bolting shall receive a Positive Material Identifica­
tion examination by Guide B1916. 
S58.3 The quantity examined shall be 100 % of the bolting.
