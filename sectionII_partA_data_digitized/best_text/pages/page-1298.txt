from an electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission 
shall be regarded as having the same validity as a counter­
part printed in the certifier's facility. The content of the 
EDI transmitted document must meet the requirements of 
the invoked ASTM standard(s) and conform to any existing 
EDI agreement between the purchaser and the supplier. 
Notwithstanding the absence of a signature, the organiza­
tion submitting the EDI transmission is responsible for the 
content of the report. 
NOTE 2-The industry definition as invoked here is: EDI is the computer 
to computer exchange of business information in an agreed upon standard 
format such as ANSI ASC Xl2. 
15. Marking 
15.1 As a minimum requirement, the material shall 
be identified by having the manufacturer's name, ASTM 
designation, weight, purchaser's order number, and mate­
rial identification legibly stenciled on top of each lift or 
shown on a tag attached to each coil or shipping unit. 
15.2 When specified in the contract or order, and for 
direct procurement by or direct shipment to the govern­
ment, marking for shipment, in addition to requirements 
specified in the contract or order, shall be in accordance 
with MIL-STD-129 for military agencies and in accordance 
with Fed. Std. No. 123 for civil agencies. 
15.3 For Government procurement by the Defense Sup­
ply Agency, strip material shall be continuously marked

15.4 Bar coding is acceptable as a supplementary iden­
tification method. Bar coding should be consistent with 
the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) standard 
prepared by the primary metals subcommittee of the AIAG 
bar code project team. 
16. Packaging 
16.1 Unless otherwise specified, the strip shall be pack­
aged and loaded in accordance with Practices A 700. 
16.2 When specified in the contract or order, and for 
direct procurement by or direct shipment to the govern­
ment, when Level A is specified, preservation, packaging, 
and packing shall be in accordance with the Level A 
requirements of MIL-STD-163. 
16.3 When coils are ordered it is customary to specify 
a minimum or range of inside diameter, maximum outside 
diameter, and a maximum coil weight, if required. The 
ability of manufacturers to meet the maximum coil weights 
depends upon individual mill equipment. When required, 
minimum coil weights are subject to negotiation.
