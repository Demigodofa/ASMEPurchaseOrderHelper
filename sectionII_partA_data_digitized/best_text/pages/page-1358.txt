4.1.6 Length (specific or random) (see Section 11), 
4.1.7 End finish (section on ends of Specification A999/ 
A999M), 
4.1.8 Optional requirements (product analysis, Section 9; 
hydrostatic test or nondestructive electric test, Section 14), 
4.1.9 Test report required (section on certification of Speci­
fication A999/ A999M), 
4.1.10 Specification designation, and 
4.1.11 Special requirements and any supplementary require­
ments selected. 
5. General Requirements 
5.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A999/ A999M unless otherwise provided herein. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 Manufacture: 
6.1.1 The pipe shall be made by the seamless or an 
automatic welding process, with no addition of filler metal in 
the welding operation. 
6.1.2 At the manufacturer's option, pipe may be either 
hot-finished or cold-finished. 
6.1.3 The pipe shall be pickled free of scale. When bright 
annealing is used, pickling is not necessary. 
6.2 Discard-A sufficient discard shall be made from each 
ingot to secure freedom from injurious piping and undue 
segregation. 
6.3 Unless otherwise stated in the order, all pipe shall be 
furnished in the heat-treated condition as shown in Table 1. 
6.3.1 For seamless pipe, as an alternate to final heat treat­
ment in a continuous furnace or batch-type furnace, immedi­
ately following hot forming while the temperature of the pipes 
is not less than the specified minimum solution treatment 
temperature, pipes shall be individually quenched in water or 
rapidly cooled by other means, except for UNS S32950, which 
shall be air cooled. 
6.3.2 If the purchaser desires pipe without heat treatment 
subsequent to welding, the purchase order shall specify the 
following condition: 
6.3.2.1 No final heat treatment of pipe fabricated from plate 
that has been heat treated as required by Table 1 for the 
particular grade is required, provided a sample of that heat of 
finished pipe or material representative of that heat of pipe as 
a prolongation of the weld passes the Test Methods A923 
Method B or C (See Note 2), including base metal, weld metal, 
and heat affected zone per heat. Each pipe supplied under this 
requirement shall be stenciled with the suffix "HT-O." 
6.3.2.2 For materials not listed in Table 3 of Test Methods 
A923, the HT-O provision does not apply. 
NoTE 2-The Test Methods A923 test method (B or C) is at the 
manufacturer's option, unless otherwise specified by the purchaser. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements as 
prescribed in Table 2. 
8. Heat Analysis 
8.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the 
steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of the ele­
ments specified. 
9. Product Analysis 
9.1 At the request of the purchaser's inspector, an analysis 
of one billet or one length of flat-rolled stock from each heat, 
or two pipes from each lot, shall be made by the manufacturer. 
A lot of pipe shall consist of the following number of lengths 
of the same size and wall thickness from any one heat of steel: 
NPS Designator 
Under 2 
2 to 5, incl 
6 and over 
Lengths of Pipe in Lot 
400 or fraction thereof 
200 or fraction thereof 
1 00 or fraction thereof 
9.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the 
purchaser or the purchaser's representative and shall conform 
to the requirements specified in Section 7. 
9.3 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 8.1 or 9.1 
does not conform to the requirements specified in Section 7, an 
analysis of each billet or pipe from the same heat or lot may be 
made, and all billets or pipe conforming to the requirements 
shall be accepted. 
10. Tensile and Hardness Properties 
10.1 The material shall conform to the tensile and hardness 
properties prescribed in Table 3. 
11. Lengths 
11.1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following 
regular practice: 
11.1.1 Unless otherwise agreed upon, all sizes from NPS 1/s 
to and including NPS 8 are available in a length up to 24 ft (see 
Note 3) with the permissible range of 15 to 24 ft (see Note 3). 
Short lengths are acceptable and the number and minimum 
length shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
NoTE 3-This value applies when the inch-pound designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase. When the M designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase, the corresponding metric value( s) 
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
11.1.2 If definite cut lengths are desired, the lengths re­
quired shall be specified in the order. No pipe shall be less than 
the specified length and no more than ¼ in. [6 mm] over it. 
11.1.3 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise specified. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The finished pipes shall be reasonably straight and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. Imperfections may be re­
moved by grinding, provided the wall thicknesses are not 
decreased to less than that permitted, in the Permissible 
Variations in Wall Thickness Section of Specification A999/ 
A999M. 
13. Mechanical Tests Required 
13.1 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One tension 
test shall be made on a specimen for lots of not more than 100 
1296
