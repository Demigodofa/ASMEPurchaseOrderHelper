3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions: 
3.1.1 The definitions in Specification A999/A999M and 
Terminology A941 are applicable to this specification. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It shall be the responsibility of the purchaser to specify 
all requirements that are necessary for product under this 
specification. Such requirements to be considered include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
4.1.2 Name of material (electric-fusion-welded pipe), 
4.1.3 Grade (Table 1), 
4.1.4 Class (see 1.3), 
4.1.5 Size (outside diameter and nominal wall thickness), 
4.1.6 Length (specific or random), 
4.1.7 End finish (Section on Ends of Specification A999/ 
A999M), 
4.1.8 Authorization for repair of plate defects by welding 
and subsequent heat treatment without prior approval if such is 
intended (see 9.3), 
4.1.9 Specification designation, 
4.1.10 Special requirements, 
4.1.11 Statement invoking requirements of 16.4 if such is 
intended. 
4.1.12 Circumferential weld permissibility (see Section 16), 
4.1.13 Supplementary Requirements (Sl through SS), 
4.1.14 Applicable ASME Code if known, 
4.1.15 For ASME Code Section III applications, the service 
classification intended, and 
4.1.16 Certification requirements (see Section on Certifica­
tion of Specification A999/A999M). 
5. General Requirements 
5.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the applicable requirements of the current edition of Specifi­
cation A999/ A999M unless otherwise provided herein. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 Materials: 
6.1.1 The steel plate material shall conform to the require­
ments of one of the grades of Specification A240/ A240M, 
listed in Table 1, except as provided in 6.3.2.3. 
6.2 Welding: 
6.2.1 The joints shall be full penetration double-welded or 
single-welded butt joints employing fusion welding processes 
as defined under "Definitions," ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code, Section IX. This specification malces no provision 
for any difference in weld quality requirements regardless of 
the weld joint type employed (single or double) in making the 
weld. Where backing rings or strips are employed, the ring or 
strip material shall be of the same P-Number (Table QW-422 
of Section IX) as the plate being joined. Backing rings or strips 
shall be completely removed after welding, prior to any 
required radiography, and the exposed weld surface shall be 
examined visually for conformance to the requirements of 
6.2.3. Welds made by procedures employing backing strips or 
rings that remain in place are prohibited. Welding procedures, 
and welding operators shall be qualified· in accordance with 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX. 
6.2.2 Except as provided in 6.2.2.1 and 6.2.2.2, welds shall 
be made in their entirety by processes involving the deposition 
of filler metal. 
6.2.2.1 For Class 4 pipe employing multiple passes, the 
root-pass may be without the addition of filler metal. 
6.2.2.2 For Class 4 pipe, the weld surface exposed inside the 
pipe may result from a single pass made from the inside of the 
pipe without the addition of filler metal. 
6.2.2.3 All single-welded pipe shall be completely radio­
graphed. 
6.2.3 The weld surface on either side of the weld is 
permitted to be flush with the base plate or to have a reasonably 
uniform crown, not to exceed 1/s in. [3 mm]. It is pemritted at 
the option of the manufacturer or by agreement between the 
manufacturer and purchaser to remove any weld reinforce­
ment. The contour of the reinforcement should be reasonably 
smooth and free from irregularities. The deposited metal shall 
be fused uniformly into the plate surface. No concavity of 
contour is permitted unless the resulting thickness of weld 
metal is equal to or greater than the minimum thickness of the 
adjacent base metal.

6.2.4 Weld defects shall be repaired by removal to sound 
metal and rewelding. Subsequent heat treatment and examina­
tion (that is, visual, radiographic, and dye penetrant) shall be as 
required on the original welds. 
6.3 Heat Treatment:
