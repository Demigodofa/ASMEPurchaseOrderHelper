ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-540 /SA-540M 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
These requirements shall not apply unless specified in the order, in which event the tests shall be 
made at the mill at the purchaser's expense unless otherwise agreed upon. 
Sl. Product Analysis 
S 1.1 Product analysis shall be made on each bar, seamless 
tube, bored bar, or the parent bar from which forged hollows 
are made. Individual pieces failing to conform to Table 1 shall 
be rejected. 
S2. Macroetch Test 
S2. l The material shall be macroetch tested and shall meet 
the quality and cleanliness requirements as specified by the 
purchaser. The macroetch examination may be made on 
representative billets from which the material will be produced 
or it may be made on samples cut from the ends of the bars, 
seamless tubes, bored bars, or forged hollows. The samples 
shall be prepared in accordance with the procedure described in 
Method E381. 
NoTE S2.1-The quality and cleanliness may be specified by the 
purchaser as equal to or better than that indicated by a designated Jetter 
and plate number of Military Standard-430 (latest revision). 
S3. Ultrasonic Test 
S3.l Each length shall be ultrasonically inspected in a 
manner agreeable to the purchaser and supplier. 
S4. Demonstration of Capability 
S4.1 When annealed bolting material is ordered to 6.1, a 
sample piece in length at least 3 x diameter D of a represen­
tative bar shall be heat treated in accordance with 6.2 and 6.3. 
Mechanical test samples taken as required by Section 15 shall 
meet the requirements of 8.2 and 10.2. 
S5. Fracture Transition Temperature 
S5.1 The fracture transition temperature for a 50 % fibrous 
(ductile shear) fracture shall be determined. The procedure for 
determination of the fracture transition temperature shall be to 
prepare four sets (three to a set) of Charpy V-notch specimens 
in accordance with Section 15. One set of three specimens shall 
be tested at approximately 70 °F [20 °C]. The absorbed energy 
in foot-pounds shall be recorded and the percent of fibrous 
fracture determined from Table S5.1 and Fig. S5.l. The other 
three sets shall be tested at successively lower or higher 
temperatures to bracket the temperature where the bolting 
material will exhibit a 50 % fibrous fracture. The results of all 
test data are to be reported to the purchaser. 
S6. Magnetic Particle Inspection 
S6.1 Bolting material may be supplied to cleanliness re­
quirements by agreement between the purchaser and supplier. 
The cleanliness shall be determined by the magnetic particle 
method described in the latest issue of Practice E45. 
NoTE S6.1-The bolting material shall have the minimum stock 
removal specified in Table S6.1 prior to magnetic particle inspection. 
S7. Elevated Temperature Test 
S7.1 Three Charpy V-notch specimens shall be tested at 
212 °F [100 °C] to determine the ''upper shelf' fracture energy 
of the material. No specimen thus tested shall break at an 
energy less than 30 ft-lbf [41 J]. 
S8. Alternative Fracture Toughness Requirement 
S8.1 The fracture toughness requirements (Charpy impact 
test) for bolting material of the ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code, Section III, Subarticle NB 2300, shall be used 
instead of the Charpy impact test requirement specified in
