5. Common Requirements 
5.1 Bolting materials and bolting components supplied to 
this specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci­
fication A962/ A962M. These requirements include test 
methods, finish, thread dimensions, marking, certification, 
optional supplementary requirements, and others. Failure to 
comply with the requirements of Specification A962/A9.62M 
constitutes nonconformance with this specification. In case of 
conflict between the requirements of this specification and 
Specification A962/ A962M, this specification shall prevail. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 Finishing Process: 
6.1.1 Threads may be formed by machining or rolling. 
Threads may be formed after precipitation heat treatment or 
after solution anneal but prior to precipitation heat treatment. 
Type designations are as follows: 
Type Ml-threads formed by machining after precipitation 
heat treatment. 
Type M2-threads formed by machining after solution 
anneal but prior to precipitation heat treatment. 
Type RI-threads formed by rolling after precipitation heat 
treatment. 
Type R2-threads formed by rolling after solution anneal 
but prior to precipitation heat treatment. 
When not specified by the purchaser, the type supplied shall 
be the option of the manufacturer. 
6.2 Heat Treatment-Each grade and class shall be heat 
treated as prescribed in Table 4. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 Each alloy shall conform to the chemical composition 
requirements prescribed in Table 3. 
8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 Tension Test: 
8.1.1 Requirements-Bolting material in each heat­
treatment charge shall conform to the room-temperature tensile 
requirements in Table 5. 
8.1.2 Number of Specimens: 
8.1.2.1 Heat-Treated Bars-When not more than two sizes 
of bars are heat treated in the same load, one tension test shall 
be made from each size in each heat of material in the 
heat-treatment charge (see 3.1.1). When more than two sizes of 
bars are treated in the same charge, one tension test shall be 
made from one bar of each of the two largest diameters from 
each heat of material in the heat-treating charge. 
8.1.2.2 Finished Bolting Components-One tension test 
shall be made if the lot consists of parts of the same nominal 
diameter. If the lot consists of components of more than one 
nominal diameter, one tension test shall be made from each 
nominal diameter of each heat involved in the lot (see Section 
3). 
8.2 Stress-Rupture Test: 
8.2.1 Requirements-Bolting material shall conform: to the 
stress-rupture requirements prescribed in Table 6 for design 
temperatures above 800 °F [427 °C]. Bolting material not 
stress-rupture tested shall be permanently stamped NR. Grade 
660 Class D and Grade 668 do not require stress-rupture and 
shall be stamped NR. 
8.2.2 The number of specimens shall be the same as the 
required number of tension test specimens. 
8.2.3 The test location and orientation shall be the same as 
that required for the tension test specimens. 
8.2.4 Test Method: 
8.2.4.1 The rupture test shall be performed in accordance 
with Practice El39. 
NOTE 1-Fig. 1 is taken from Test Method E292. This is to facilitate 
detection of notch sensitivity. The specimen found in Practice El39 does 
not include a notch. The specimen in Fig. 1 is to be used only to determine 
if the material is notch sensitive. Actual testing is to Practice E139, not 
Test Method E292, so the additional test data required by Test Method 
E292 is not to be determined or reported. 
8.2.4.2 A combination smooth and notched test specimen, 
machined to the dimensions prescribed in Fig. 1 and Table 7, 
shall be tested in accordance with the stress-rupture require­
ments prescribed in Table 6. The test shall be continued to 
rupture. The rupture shall occur in the smooth section of the 
bar. 
8.2.4.3 As an alternative procedure and, when specifically 
approved by the purchaser, separate smooth and notched test 
specimens, machined from adjacent sections of the same piece, 
with gage sections conforming to the respective dimensions of 
Table 7, may be tested under the above conditions. The notched 
specimen need not be tested to rupture but shall not rupture in 
less time than the companion smooth specimen. 
8.2.4.4 When the minimum specified time to rupture in 
Table 6 has been achieved, incremental loading may be used to 
accelerate the time to rupture. At intervals of 8 to 16 h, 
preferably 8 to 10 h, the stress shall be increased in increments 
of 5000 psi [34.5 MPa]. Rupture location, and elongation 
requirements shall be as prescribed in Table 6, 8.2.4.2, and 
8.2.4.3. 
8.3 Hardness Test: 
757 
8.3.1 Requirements-Bolting material shall conform to the 
room temperature hardness requirements prescribed in Table 5. 
8.3.2 Number of Tests:
