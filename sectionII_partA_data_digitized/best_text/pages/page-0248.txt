INTIIRNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Carbon Steel and Carbon­
Manganese Steel Boiler and Superheater Tubes 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation Al 78/ Al 78M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
electric-resistance-welded tubes made of carbon steel and 
carbon-manganese steel intended for use as boiler tubes, boiler 
flues, superheater flues, and safe ends. 
1.2 This specification covers Grades A, C, and D with 
differing chemical requirements (Section 6 and Table 1), 
differing tensile requirements (Section 9 and Table 2), and 
differing crush and mechanical testing requirements (Sections 
10 and 11). 
NOTE I-Grades C and D tubes are not suitable for safe-ending for 
forge welding. 
1.3 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are ½ to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside 
diameter and 0.035 to 0.360 in. [0.9 to 9.1 mm], inclusive, in 
minimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may 
be furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.4 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.Q15 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.5 Optional supplementary requirements are provided and 
when desired, shall be so stated in the order. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee A0l on Steel, 
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee 
A0l.09 on Carbon Steel Tubular Products.

1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
