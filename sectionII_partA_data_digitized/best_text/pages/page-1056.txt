SA-563 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
5.5 Chemical analyses shall be performed in accor­
dance with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology 
A 751. 
6. Mechanical Properties 
6.1 Hardness: 
6.1.1 The hardness of nuts of each grade shall not 
exceed the maximum hardness specified for the grade in 
Table 3. 
6.1.2 Jam nuts, slotted nuts, nuts smaller in width 
across flats or thickness than standard hex nuts (7.1), and 
nuts that would require a proof load in excess of 160 000 lbf 
may be furnished on the basis of minimum hardness 
requirements specified for the grade in Table 3, unless proof 
load testing is specified in the inquiry and purchase order. 
6.2 Proof Load: 
6.2.1 Nuts of each grade, except those listed in 6.1.2, 
shall withstand the proof load stress specified for the grade, 
size, style, thread series, and surface finish of the nut in 
Table 3 and Table 4. 
6.2.2 Nuts hot dip or mechanically zinc coated in 
accordance with 4.7.2 or 4.7.3 shall be proof load tested 
after zinc coating and overtapping. 
7. Dimensions 
7.1 Unless otherwise specified, nuts shall be plain 
(uncoated) and shall conform to the dimensions prescribed 
in ANSI B18.2.2. 
7.2 Hex and hex-slotted nuts over 1½ to 2 in. inclusive 
shall have dimensions conforming to ANSI Bl8.2.2 calcu­
lated using the formulas for the 1 ¼ through 1 ½ in. size 
range in Appendix III (Formulas for Nut Dimensions) of 
ANSI Bl8.2.2. 
7.3 Threads: Plain (Uncoated) Nuts 
7.3.1 Unless otherwise specified, the threads shall 
conform to the dimensions for coarse threads with Class 2B 
tolerances prescribed in ANSI B 1.1. 
7.4 Threads: Nuts Hot Dip Zinc Coated Specification 
F 2329 (4.7.2) 
7.4.1 Nuts to be used on bolts with Class 2A threads 
before hot-dip zinc coating, and then hot-dip zinc coated 
in accordance with Specification F 2329, shall be tapped 
oversize after coating, to the minimum and maximum 
thread dimensions in Table 5. The major and minor diame­
ters shall also be increased by the allowance to provide the 
corresponding minimum and maximum major and minor 
diameters. 
1.5 Threads: Nuts With Other Coatings 
7.5.1 Nuts to be used on bolts mechanically zinc 
coated or on bolts hot-dip zinc-coated to a specification 
other than Specification F 2329, or otherwise hot-dip 
coated, shall be tapped oversize by a diametral amount 
sufficient to permit assembly on the coated bolt thread, 
unless other requirements are specified in the inquiry or 
purchase order. 
7.5.2 When specifically permitted by the purchaser, 
nuts for bolts with electrodeposited coating, such as cad­
mium, zinc, and so forth, or with chemically applied coat­
ing may be tapped oversize by a diametral amount sufficient 
to permit assembly on the coated bolt thread. 
956 
7 .5.3 The allowable oversize tapping shall not 
exceed that specified in Table 5. 
8. Workmanship 
8.1 Surface discontinuity limits shall be in accordance 
with Specification F 812/F 812M. 
9. Number of Tests 
9.1 The requirements of this specification shall be met 
in continuous mass production for stock, and the manufac­
turer shall make sample inspections to ensure that the prod­
uct conforms to the specified requirements. Additional tests 
of individual shipments of material are not ordinarily con­
templated. Individual heats of steel are not identified in 
the finished product. 
9.2 When additional tests are specified in the inquiry 
and purchase order, a lot, for purposes of selecting test 
samples, shall consist of all material offered for inspection 
at one time that has the following common characteristics: 
9.2.1 Grade, 
9.2.2 Nominal size, 
9.2.3 Style of nut, 
9.2.4 Thread series and class, and 
9.2.5 Surface finish. 
9.3 Unless otherwise specified in the inquiry and pur­
chase order, the number of tests for each lot of required 
property shall be as follows: 
Number of Nuts in Lot 
800 and under 
801 to 8 000 
8 001 to 22 000 
Over 22 000 
Number of Specimens

9.4 If any test specimen shows flaws, it may be dis­
carded and another specimen substituted.
