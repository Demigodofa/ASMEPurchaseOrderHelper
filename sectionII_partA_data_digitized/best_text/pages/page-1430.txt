6.3.1 Method I-This method shall always be used when 
the maximum as-heat-treated thickness does not exceed 2 in. 
[50 mm]. Specimens shall be located in the production forging 
or test forging (as described in Method 4) at mid-thickness and 
at least 2 in. [50 mm] from other as-heat-treated surfaces. 
6.3.2 Method 2-T by 2T, where Tis the distance from the 
area of significant loading (see 3.1) to the nearest as-heat­
treated surface. However, the specimen shall not be nearer to 
one as-heat-treated surface than¾ in. [20 mm] and not nearer 
than 1 ½ in. [40 mm] to a second as-heat-treated surface. When 
this method of testing is employed, forgings are usually 
manufactured in accordance with a purchaser-approved draw­
ing showing pre-heat-treatment dimensions and the location of 
test specimens. 
6.3.3 Method 3-¼ T by T, where T is the maximum 
thickness of the forging as-heat-treated. When this method of 
testing is employed for Class 2, the maximum as-heat-treated 
thickness shall not exceed 8 in. [200 mm] unless otherwise 
agreed. 
6.3.4 Method 4-Test specimens shall be taken from a 
representative separate test forging or bar made from the same 
heat of steel that shall receive substantially the same reduction 
and type of hot working as the production forgings which it 
represents; except that a longitudinally forged bar may be used 
to represent a rolled ring of similar cross section. It shall be of 
the same nominal thickness as the as-heat-treated production 
forgings and shall be heat treated in the same furnace charge 
and under the same conditions as the production forgings. Test 
specimens shall be removed using the ¼ T by T procedure 
referenced in Method 3 with the same limitation on forging 
thickness as in 6.3.3. This method shall be limited to forgings 
with a rough machined weight of not more than 1000 lb 
[500 kg]. 
6.4 Metal Buffers-The required distances from as-heat­
treated surfaces may be obtained with metal buffers instead of 
integral extensions. Buffer material may be carbon or low-alloy 
steel and shall be joined to the forging with a partial penetra­
tion weld that seals the buffered surface. Specimens shall be 
located at least ½ in. [13 mm] from the buffered surface of the 
forging. Buffers shall be removed and the welded areas 
subjected to magnetic particle test to ensure freedom from

cracks unless the welded areas are completely removed by 
subsequent machining. 
6.5 Samples shall be removed from forgings after heat 
treatment. The sample material shall be subjected to a simu­
lated post-weld heat-treatment if Supplementary Requirement 
S l is specified. 
6.6 Orientation-For upset disk forgings, the longitudinal 
axis of all test specimens shall be oriented in the tangential 
direction. For all other forgings, the longitudinal axis of the 
specimens shall be oriented in the direction of maximum 
working of the forging unless Supplementary Requirements 
S 11 or S 14 are imposed. 
6.7 Number of Tests: 
6.7.1 Forgings Under 500 lb [250 kg] As-Heat-Treated­
For duplicate forgings weighing less than 500 lb [250 kg] 
as-heat-treated, one tension test and one impact test (three 
specimens) shall be made to represent each heat in each 
heat-treatment charge. When heat-treatment is performed in 
continuous-type furnaces with suitable temperature control and 
equipped with recording pyrometers so that complete heat­
treatment records are available, a heat-treatment charge shall 
be considered as any continuous run not exceeding any 8 h 
duration. 
6.7.2 Forgings Weighing 500 to JO 000 lb [250 to 5000 kg] 
As-Heat-Treated-One tension and one impact test (three 
specimens) shall be made for each forging. 
6.7.3 Each forging weighing over 10 000 lb [5000 kg] shall 
require two tension tests and two impact tests, located at 
opposite ends if the length, excluding test prolongations, 
exceeds 80 in. [2000 mm], or located 180° apart for shorter 
length forgings. 
7. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
7 .1 The forgings shall conform to the dimensions specified 
by the purchaser. The finishes shall permit adequate visual 
inspection for surface imperfections. If a dimension varies 
from that specified, the forging may be offered to the purchaser 
for acceptance.
