SA-311/SA-311M ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR COLD-DRAWN, STRESS­
RELIEVED CARBON STEEL BARS SUBJECT TO 
MECHANICAL PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS 
SA-311/SA-311M 
[Identical to ASTM Specification A311/A311M-04(2015) except for deletion of 5.1.11, revision of Note A to Table 1 and an editorial change to 
5.1.9. Certification has been made mandatory in I 1.1.J 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers two classes, nine grades, 
and four conditions of stress-relieved cold-drawn carbon 
steel bars produced to mechanical property requirements. 
One class, B, is cold drawn with higher than normal (heavy) 
drafts to provide higher strength levels, and four grades 
provide improved machinability. 
1.2 Supplementary Requirements, S 1 through S6, of 
an optional nature are provided. 
1.3 The values stated in inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded as the standard. Within the text, the SI 
units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents, therefore, each system 
must be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in nonconformance with 
the specification.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions: 
3.1.1 stress relieving - heating to a suitable tempera­
ture, holding long enough to reduce residual stresses, and 
446 
then cooling slowly enough to minimize the development 
of new residual stresses. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.1 heavy draft- Using higher than normal drafts 
(approximately 10% through 35% reduction), followed by 
stress relieving, produces higher tensile and yield strengths 
provided an appropriate composition is used; for example, 
medium carbon with nonnal or higher manganese content.
