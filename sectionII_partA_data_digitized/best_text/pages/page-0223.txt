the desired material adequately, when ordered under this 
specification: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material (seamless carbon steel pipe), 
3.1.3 Grade (Table 1), 
3.1.4 Manufacture (hot-finished or cold-drawn), 
3.1.5 Size (NPS [DN] and weight class or schedule number, 
or both; outside diameter and nominal wall thickness; or inside 
diameter and nominal wall thickness), 
3.1.6 Special outside diameter tolerance pipe (16.2.2), 
3.1.7 Inside diameter tolerance pipe, over 10 in. [250 mm] 
ID (16.2.3), 
3.1.8 Length (specific or random, Section 17), 
3.1.9 Optional requirements (Sl to S9), 
3.1.10 Test report required (Section on Certification of 
Specification A530/ A530M), 
3.1.11 Specification designation (A106 or A106M, includ­
ing year-date), 
3.1.12 End use of material, 
3.1.13 Hydrostatic test in accordance with Specification 
A530/A530M or 13.3 of this specification, or NDE in accor­
dance with Section 14 of this specification. 
3.1.14 Special requirements. 
4. Process 
4.1 The steel shall be killed steel, with the primary melting 
process being open-hearth, basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace, 
possibly combined with separate degassing or refining. If 
secondary melting, using electroslag remelting or vacuum-arc 
remelting is subsequently employed, the heat shall be defined 
as all of the ingots remelted from a single primary heat. 
4.2 Steel cast in ingots or strand cast is permissible. When 
steels of different grades are sequentially strand cast, identifi­
cation of the resultant transition material is required. The 
producer shall remove the transition material by any estab­
lished procedure that positively separates the grades.

A For each reduction of 0.01 % below the specified carbon maximum, an increase 
of 0.06 % manganese above the specified maximum will be permitted up to a 
maximum of 1.35 %. 
8 Unless otherwise specified by the purchaser, for each reduction of 0.01 % below 
the specified carbon maximum, an Increase of 0.06 % manganese above the 
specified maximum will be permitted up to a maximum of 1.65 %. 
0 These five elements combined shall not exceed 1 %. 
4.3 For pipe NPS 1 ½ [DN 40] and under, it shall be 
permissible to furnish hot finished or cold drawn. 
4.4 Unless otherwise specified, pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] and 
over shall be furnished hot finished. When agreed upon 
between the manufacturer and the purchaser, it is permissible 
to furnish cold-drawn pipe. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 Hot-finished pipe need not be heat treated. When hot­
finished pipe is heat treated, it shall be heat treated at a 
temperature of 1200 °F [650 °C] or higher. 
5.2 Cold-drawn pipe shall be heat treated after the final cold 
draw pass at a temperature of 1200 °F [650 °C] or higher. 
6. General Requirements 
6.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the applicable requirements of the current edition of Specifi­
cation A530/A530M unless otherwise provided herein. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
8. Heat Analysis 
8.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the 
steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of the ele­
ments specified in Section 7. If the secondary melting pro­
cesses of 5.1 are employed, the heat analysis shall be obtained 
from one remelted ingot or the product of one remelted ingot 
of each primary melt. The chemical composition thus 
determined, or that determined from a product analysis made 
by the manufacturer, if the latter has not manufactured the 
steel, shall be reported to the purchaser or the purchaser's 
representative, and shall conform to the requirements specified 
in Section 7. 
171 
9. Product Analysis 
9.1 At the request of the purchaser, analyses of two pipes 
from each lot (see 20.1) shall be made by the manufacturer 
from the finished pipe. The results of these analyses shall be 
reported to the purchaser or the purchaser's representative and 
shall conform to the requirements specified in Section 7. 
9.2 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 9.1 does 
not conform to the requirements specified in Section 7, 
analyses shall be made on additional pipes of double the 
original number from the same lot, each of which shall 
conform to requirements specified. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties given in Table 2. 
11. Bending Requirements 
11.1 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] and under, a sufficient length 
of pipe shall stand being bent cold through 90° around a 
cylindrical mandrel, the diameter of which is twelve times the 
outside diameter (as shown in ASME B 36.lOM) of the pipe,
