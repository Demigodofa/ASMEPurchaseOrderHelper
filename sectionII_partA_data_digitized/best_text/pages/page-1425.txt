Xl.3 Outline of TMCP As May Be Applied to Grade G-As 
shown in Fig. Xl .2, TMCP for this grade may incorporate three 
processes, as follows: 
Xl.3.1 Thermo-Mechanical Rolling and Intermediately 
Heat Treated and Tempered (TMR-I-T)-Subsequent to TMR 
as described in Xl.2.1, the plate may be tempered, except that 
prior to tempering after TMR, the plate may be subjected to an 
intermediate heat treatment consisting of heating to a tempera­
ture in the range from Ac 1 to Ac 3 · 
Xl.3.2 Direct Quenched and Tempered (DQ-T)-As de­
scribed in Xl.2.3. 
Xl.3.3 Direct Quenched and Intermediately Heat Treated 
and Tempered (DQ-I-T)-Similar to DQT, as described in 
Xl .2.3, except that prior to the tempering treatment and after 
DQ, the plate may be subjected to an intermediate heat 
treatment consisting of heating to a temperature in the range 
from Ac 1 to Ac3· 
Xl.3.4 The selection, from the above, of the method to be 
used is made by the plate producer depending upon the 
chemical composition, the plate thickness, and the required 
prope1ties.
