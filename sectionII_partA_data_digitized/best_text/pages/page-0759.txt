A Calculated elongation requirements shall be rounded to the nearest whole 
number. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
7. Product Analysis 
7.1 An analysis of either one billet, one length of flat-rolled 
stock or one tube shall be made from each heat. The chemical 
composition thus determined shall conform to the requirements 
specified. 
7 .2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional billets, lengths of flat-rolled stock, or tubes shall 
be made. Both retests, for the elements in question shall meet 
the requirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot (Note 1) shall be rejected or, at the 
option of the producer, each billet, length of flat-rolled stock or 
tube may be individually tested for acceptance. Billets, lengths 
of flat-rolled stock or tubes which do not meet the requirements 
of the specification shall be rejected. 
NOTE 1-For flattening, flaring, and flange requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting of the same nominal size and wall 
thickness that are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
the same size and from the same heat which are heat treated in the same 
furnace charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace 
the number of tubes of the same size and from the same heat in a lot shall 
be determined from the size of the tubes as prescribed in Table 2. 
NoTE 2-For tensile and hardness test requirements, the term lot applies 
to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall 
thickness that are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
TABLE 2 Number of Tubes In a Lot Heat Treated by the 
Continuous Process 
Size of Tube 
2 in. [50.8 mm] and over in outside diameter and 
0.200 in. [5.1 mm] and over in wall thickness 
Less than 2 in. [50.8 mm] but over 1 in. [25.4 mm] in 
outside diameter or over 1 in. [25.4 mm] in 
outside diameter and under 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] 
in wall thickness 
1 in. [25.4 mm] or less in outside diameter 
Size of Lot 
not more than 50 
tubes 
not more than 75 
tubes 
not more than 125 
tubes 
the same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, a lot shall 
include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the same furnace 
at the same temperature, time at heat, and furnace speed. 
8. Tensile Requirements 
8.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in Table 3. 
9. Hardness Requirements 
9.1 The tubes shall have a hardness number not exceeding 
170 HBW or 87 HRBW. 
10. Forming Operations 
10.1 Tubes when inserted in the boiler shall stand expanding 
and beading without showing cracks or flaws. 
11. Mechanical Tests Required 
11 .1 Tension Test-One tension test shall be made on a 
specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall 
be made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes (Note 2). 
11.2 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used 
for the flaring or flanging test, from each lot (Note 1). 
11.3 Flaring Test (Seamless Tubes)-One flaring test shall 
be made on specimens from each end of one finished tube, not 
the one used for the flattening test, from each lot (Note 1). 
11.4 Flange Test (Welded Tubes)-One flange test shall be 
made on specimens from each end of one finished tube, not the 
one used for the flattening test, from each lot (Note 1). 
11.5 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot 
(Note 2). 
11.6 Reverse Flattening Test-For welded tubes, one re­
verse flattening test shall be made on a specimen from each 
1500 ft [460 m] of finished tubing. 
709 
11.7 Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test-Each 
tube shall be subjected to the hydrostatic test, or, instead of this 
test, a nondestructive electric test may be used when specified 
by the purchaser. 
12. General Requirements 
12.1 Material furnished under this specification should con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A450/ A450M, unless otherwise provided herein.
