Al. PERMISSIBLE VARIATIONS IN 
DIMENSIONS AND MASS IN SI UNITS 
Al.1 Listed in Tables Al.1 through Al.7 are permissi­
ble variations in dimensions and mass expressed in the 
International System of Units (SI) terminology.

NOTE 1 - Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with either flat anvils having a minimum diameter of 4.80 mm 
or rounded anvils having a minimum radius of curvature of 2.55 mm. Micrometers with pointed anvils are not suitable for thickness measurement. 
A Measurements for the above table are taken 10 mm from the edge of a strip on 25 mm or wider; and at any place on the strip when nar­
rower than 25 mm. The given tolerances do not include crown and therefore the tolerances for crown as shown in Table AL3 are in addition 
to tolerances in Table ALL
