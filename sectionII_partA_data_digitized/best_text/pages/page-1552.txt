INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Steel, Sheet, Cold-Rolled, Carbon, Structural, High-Strength 
Low-Alloy, High-Strength Low-Alloy with Improved 
Formability, Required Hardness, Solution Hardened, and 
Bake Hardenable 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A1008/A1008M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the 
year of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last 
reapproval. A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1. 1 This specification covers cold-rolled, carbon, structural, 
high-strength low-alloy, high-strength low-alloy with im­
proved formability, required hardness, full hard, solution 
hardened, and bake hardenable steel sheet, in. coils and cut 
lengths. 
1.2 Cold rolled steel sheet is available in the designations as 
listed in 4.1. 
1.3 This specification does not apply to steel strip as 
described in Specification Al09/A109M. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions: 
3 .1.1 For definitions of other terms used in this 
specification, refer to Terminology A941. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.1 aging, n-loss of ductility with an increase in 
hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength that occurs when 
steel that has been slightly cold worked (such as by temper 
rolling) is stored for some time. 
3.2.1.1 Discussion-Aging increases the tendency of a steel 
to exhibit stretcher strains and fluting. 
3.2.2 Bake Hardenable Steel (BHS), n-steel in which 
significant aging is realized when moderate heat treatment, 
such as that used for paint baking, follows straining or cold 
working. 
3.2.3 Full Hard Steel (FHS), n-steel that is cold reduced 
and exhibits a microstructure consisting of non-recrystallized 
grains. 
3.2.3.1 Discussion-Chemical composition shall be deter­
mined by the producer unless there is prior agreement between 
producer and user, or seller and buyer.
