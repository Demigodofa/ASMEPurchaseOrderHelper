a Designation: A905-19 
•u II 
INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Steel Wire, Pressure Vessel Winding 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A905; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year of 
original adoption or, in the case of revision, th.e year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A 
superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification covers requirements for a high 
strength drawn and cold rolled steel wire in two strength 
classes, with rectangular cross section, and round mill edge. 
This wire is intended for prestressed vessel and press frame 
windings. 
1.2 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
(metric) units are to be regarded separately as standards. 
Within the text and tables, the SI units are shown in parenthe­
ses. The values stated in each system are not exact equivalents. 
Therefore, each system must be used independent of the other. 
Combining values from the two systems may result in noncon­
formance with the specification. 
1.3 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 It shall be the responsibility of the purchaser to specify 
all requirements that are necessary for material under this 
specification. Such requirements may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
3.1.1 Quantity (mass), 
3.1.2 Name of material, 
3.1.3 Dimensions (see Section 7), 
3.1.4 Finish (see Section 8), 
3.1.5 Packaging (see Section 11), 
3.1.6 Cast or heat analysis report (see Section 5), 
3.1.7 Number of certification or test reports required (see 
Section 10), 
3.1.8 ASTM designation and year of issue, and 
3.1.9 Supplementary requirements, if any. 
4. Material and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel shall be produced by any of the following 
primary processes: (1) basic oxygen, and (2) electric furnace or 
vacuum induction (VIM). The primary melting may incorpo­
rate separate degassing or refining and may be followed by 
secondary melting by the electrode slag process (ESR) or the 
vacuum arc remelting process (VAR). 
4.1.1 The steel may be ingot cast or continuously cast. 
4.2 The finished wire shall be free from detrimental pipe 
and undue segregation. 
4.3 The wire shall be cold drawn or cold rolled, or both, to 
produce the desired mechanical properties and dimensions 
after subjecting it to the patenting treatment. 
4.4 The width to thickness ratio of the wire cross section 
shall not exceed 8. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5 .1 The steel shall conform to the requirements for chemical 
composition prescribed in Table 1.
