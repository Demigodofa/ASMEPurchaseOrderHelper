A Steel, as defined by the American Iron and Steel Institute, shall be considered to 
be alloy when the maximum of the range given for the content of alloying elements 
exceeds one or more of the following limits: manganese, 1.65 %; silicon, 0.60 %; 
copper, 0.60 % or in which a definite range or a definite minimum quantity of any 
of the following elements is specified or required within the limits of the recognized 
field of constructional alloy steels: aluminum, chromium up to 3.99 %, cobalt, 
columbium, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, tungsten, vanadium, zirconium, or any 
other alloying elements added to obtain a desired alloying effect. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Hardness-The fasteners shall conform to the hardness 
specified in Table 3. See Table 3, Note A. 
7.2 Tensile Properties: 
7.2.1 Except as permitted in 7.2.2 for long fasteners and 
7.2.3 for short fasteners, hex cap screws and hex and square 
head bolts in sizes 1.00 in. and smaller having a length of 2¼ 
D and longer and sizes 1 1/s to 1 ½ in. inclusive having a length 
of 3D and longer shall be wedge tested full size. Bolts with 
heads other than hex or square shall be axially tested. Both 
wedge and axially tested hex cap screws and bolts shall 
conform to the proof load or alternative proof load, and 
minimum wedge tensile load in Tables 4 and 5, as applicable. 
The load applied during proof load testing shall be equal to or 
greater than the proof load in Table 4 or Table 5 as applicable. 
7.2.2 Hex cap screws and square head bolts larger than 1 ½ 
in. diameter, other than those excepted in 7 .2.3, shall preferably 
be tested full size and when so tested shall conform to the 
tensile strength and either the specified proof load or yield 
strength requirements in Tables 4 and 5, as applicable. When 
equipment of sufficient capacity for full size testing is not 
available, or when the length of the bolt makes full size testing 
732 
impractical, machined specimens shall be tested and shall 
conform to the requirements of Table 6. 
7.2.3 Sizes 1.00 in. and smaller having a length shorter than 
2¼ D down to 2D inclusive, which cannot be wedge tensile 
tested shall be axially tension tested full size and shall conform 
to the minimum tensile load and proof load or alternate proof 
load specified in Tables 4 and 5. Sizes 1.00 in. and smaller 
having a length shorter than 2D which cannot be axially tensile 
tested shall be qualified on the basis of hardness. 
7.2.4 Studs 3D and longer shall be axially tension tested full 
size and shall conform to the tensile and proof load or alternate 
proof load specified in Table 4 and Table 5, as applicable. 
When equipment for full size testing is not available, or when 
the studs are too long for full size testing, machined specimens 
shall be tested and shall conform to the tensile requirements in 
Table 6. 
7 .2.5 If fasteners are subjected to both hardness and tensile 
tests, the tensile test results shall take precedence in the event 
of low hardness test results. 
7.2.6 If fasteners are subjected to both full size and ma­
chined specimen tests, the full size test results shall take 
precedence if the results of the two methods differ. 
8. Dimensions 
8.1 Head and Body: 
8.1.1 Hex Cap Screws-Unless otherwise specified, hex cap 
screws shall be furnished with dimensions conforming to 
ASME Bl8.2.l. 
8.1.2 Bolts-When styles other than specified in 8.1.1 are 
required, they shall have dimensions conforming to those 
specified by the purchaser. 
8.1.3 Studs-Studs shall have dimensions conforming to 
those specified by the purchaser. 
8.2 Threads: 
8.2.1 Uncoated-Unless otherwise specified, uncoated 
threads shall be the Unified Coarse Thread Series as specified 
in the latest issue of ASME Bl.I, and shall have Class 2A 
tolerances. 
8.2.2 Coated-Unless otherwise specified, zinc-coated 
bolts, to be used with zinc-coated nuts or tapped holes, which 
are tapped oversize in accordance with Specification A563, 
shall have UNC Class 2A threads before hot-dip or mechani­
cally deposited zinc-coating. After zinc coating, the pitch 
diameter and major diameter shall not exceed the Class 2A 
limits by more than the following amounts: 
Nominal Diameter, in.

7/16, ½
