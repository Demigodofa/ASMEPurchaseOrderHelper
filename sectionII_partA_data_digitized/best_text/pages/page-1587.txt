ASME BPVC.II.A•2025 SA·1016/SA-1016M 
25.8.6 More or smaller reference discontinuities, or both, 
may be used by agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
25.9 Standardization Procedure: 
25.9.1 The test apparatus shall be standardized at the 
beginning and end of each series of tubes of the same specified 
size (diameter and wall thickness), grade and heat treatment 
condition, and at intervals not exceeding 4 h during the 
examination of such tubing. More frequent standardizations 
may be performed at the manufacturer's option or may be 
required upon agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
25.9.2 The test apparatus shall also be standardized after 
any change in test system settings, change of operator, equip­
ment repair, or interruption due to power loss or shutdown. 
25.9.3 The reference standard shall be passed through the 
test apparatus at the same speed and test system settings as the 
tube to be tested, except that, at the manufacturer's discretion, 
the tubes may be tested at a higher sensitivity. 
25.9.4 The signal-to-noise ratio for the reference standard 
shall be 2.5 to 1 or greater, and the reference signal amplitude 
for each discontinuity shall be at least 50 % of full scale of the 
display. In establishing the noise level, extraneous signals from 
identifiable surface imperfections on the reference standard 
may be ignored. When reject filtering is used during UT 
testing, linearity must be demonstrated. 
25.9.5 If, upon any standardization, the reference signal 
amplitude has decreased by at least 29 % (3.0 dB), the test 
apparatus shall be considered out of standardization. The test 
system settings may be changed, or the transducer(s), coil(s), 
or sensor(s) adjusted, and the unit restandardized, but all tubes 
tested since the last acceptable standardization must be re­
tested. 
25.10 Evaluation of Impeifections: 
25.10.1 Tubing producing a test signal equal to or greater 
than the lowest signal produced by the reference standard shall 
be designated suspect, shall be clearly marked or identified, 
and shall be separated from the acceptable tubing. 
25.10.2 Such suspect tubing shall be subject to one of the 
following three dispositions: 
25.10.2.1 The tubes shall be rejected without further 
examination, at the discretion of the manufacturer. 
25.10.2.2 If the test signal was produced by imperfections 
such as scratches, surface roughness, dings, straightener marks, 
loose ID bead and cutting chips, steel die stamps, stop marks, 
tube reducer ripple, or chattered flash tJ.im, the tubing shall be 
accepted or rejected depending on visual observation of the 
severity of the imperfection, the type of signal it produces on 
the testing equipment used, or both. 
25.10.2.3 If the test signal was produced by imperfections 
that cannot be identified, or was produced by cracks or 
crack-like imperfections, the tubing shall be rejected. 
25.10.3 Any tubes with imperfections of the types in 
25.10.2.2 and 25.10.2.3, exceeding 0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 
12.5 % of the specified minimum wall thickness (whichever is 
greater) in depth shall be rejected. 
25.10.4 Rejected tubes may be reconditioned and retested 
providing the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that 
required by this or the product specification. If grinding is 
perfo1med, the outside diameter in the area of grinding may be 
reduced by the amount so removed. To be accepted, recondi­
tioned tubes must pass the nondestructive examination by 
which they were originally rejected. 
26. Hydrostatic Test 
26.1 In lieu of nondestructive electJ.ic examination, and 
when specified by the purchaser, and, except as provided in 
26.2 and 26.3, each tube shall be tested by the manufacturer to 
a minimum hydrostatic test pressure determined by the follow­
ing equation: 
where: 
Inch- Pound Units:P = 32000 t/D 
SI Units:P = 220.6 t/D 
P = hydrostatic test pressure, psi or MPa, 
t = specified wall thickness, in. or mm, and 
D = specified outside diameter, in. or mm. 
(3) 
26.1.1 The hydrostatic test pressure determined by Eq 3 
shall be rounded to the nearest 50 psi [0.5 MPa] for pressure 
below 1000 psi [7 MPa], and to the nearest 100 psi [1 MPa] for 
pressures 1000 psi [7 MPa] and above. The hydrostatic test 
may be performed prior to cutting to final length, or prior to 
upsetting, swaging, expanding, bending or other forming 
operations, or both. 
26.2 Regardless of the determination made by Eq 3, the 
minimum hydrostatic test pressure required to satisfy these 
requirements need not exceed 1000 psi [7 MPa]. This does not 
prohibit testing at higher pressures at manufacturer's option or 
as provided in 26.3. 
26.3 With concurrence of the manufacturer, a minimum 
hydrostatic test pressure in excess of the requirements of 26.2 
or 26.1, or both, may be stated on the order. The tube wall 
stress shall be determined by the following equation: 
S = PD/2t (4) 
where: 
S = tube wall stress, psi or MPa, and all other symbols as 
defined in 24.1. 
26.4 The test pressure shall be held for a minimum of 5 s. 
26.5 If any tube shows leaks during the hydrostatic test, it 
shall be rejected. 
26.6 The hydrostatic test may not be capable of testing the 
end portion of the pipe. The lengths of pipe that cannot be 
tested shall be determined by the manufacturer and, when 
specified in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
27. Pneumatic Test 
27.1 Air Undenvater Test-When this test is required, each 
tube, with internal surfac~ clean and dry, shall be internally 
pressurized to 150 psi [1000 kPa] minimum with clean and dry 
compressed air while being submerged in clear water. The tube 
shall be well lighted, preferably by underwater illumination. 
Any evidence of air leakage of the pneumatic couplings shall 
be corrected prior to testing. Inspection shall be made of the
