ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-20/SA-20M 
1.5 Appendix X4 provides information on cold bending of 
plates, including suggested minimum inside radii for cold 
bending. 
1.6 These materials are intended to be suitable for fusion 
welding. When the steel is to be welded, it is presupposed that 
a welding procedure suitable for the grade of steel and intended 
use or service will be utilized. 
1.7 In case of any conflict in requirements, the requirements 
of the applicable product specification prevail over those of this 
general requirements specification. 
1.8 Additional requirements that are specified in the pur­
chase order and accepted by the supplier are permitted, 
provided that such requirements do not negate any of the 
requirements of this general requirements specification or the 
applicable product specification. 
1.9 For purposes of determining conformance with this 
general requirements specification and the applicable product 
specification, values are to be rounded to the nearest unit in the 
right-hand place of figures used in expressing the limiting 
values in accordance with the rounding method of Practice 
E29. 
1. 10 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.11 This general requirements specification and the appli­
cable product specification are expressed in both inch-pound 
units and SI units; unless the order specifies the applicable "M" 
specification designation (SI units), the plates are to be 
furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.12 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
