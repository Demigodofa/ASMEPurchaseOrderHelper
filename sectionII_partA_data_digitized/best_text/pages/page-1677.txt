MANDATORY APPENDIX Ill 
GUIDELINES ON MULTIPLE MARKING OF MATERIALS 
111-100 BACKGROUND 
A common inquiry topic is the permissibility of using 
material that is identified with two or more specifications 
(or grades, classes, or types), even if they have different 
strengths, or even if one of them is not permitted for 
use in the construction code of application. The Commit­
tee has addressed variants of these questions in several 
interpretations: 1-89-11, IIA-92-08, VIIl-1-89-269, and 
VIII-1-89-197. 
111-200 GUIDELINES 
The construction codes individually define what mate­
rials may be used in boilers, vessels, and components con­
structed in compliance to their rules. If a material meets 
all of the requirements for a specification for which it is 
marked, including documentation, if any, and if it meets 
all requirements for use imposed by the construction 
code, it may be used. The construction codes, in general, 
do not address the case of materials marked with more 
than one specification, grade, class, or type, so these 
guidelines are offered for clarification. 
111-210 ACCEPTABILITY OF MULTIPLE MARKING 
Dual or multiple marking is acceptable, as long as the 
material so marked meets all of the requirements of all 
the specifications, grades, classes, and types with which 
it is marked. 
All of the measured and controlled attributes of the 
multiply marked grades or specifications must overlap 
(e.g., chemistry, mechanical properties, dimensions, and 
tolerances) and the material so marked must exhibit val­
ues that fall within the overlaps. Further, the controlled 
but unmeasured attributes of the specifications or grades 
must overlap ( e.g., melting practices, heat treatments, and 
inspection). 
Many specifications or grades have significant overlap 
of chemistry ranges or properties. It is common for mate­
rial manufacturers to produce materials that satisfy more 
than one specification, grade, class, or type. Examples are 
SA-53 and SA-106 (some grades and classes), SA-213 
TP304L and TP304, SA-213 TP304 and TP304H, and 
SA-106 B and C. 
111-220 PROHIBITION ON MULTIPLE MARKING 
Dual or multiple marking is not acceptable if two or 
more specifications to which the material is marked have 
mutually exclusive requirements. 
This prohibition includes more than just chemistry and 
property requirements. One example is SA-515 and 
SA-516; the former requires melting to coarse grain prac­
tice while the latter requires melting to fine grain prac­
tice. Another example is SA-213 TP304L and TP304H; 
the carbon content ranges of these grades have no 
overlap. 
111-230 GRADE SUBSTITUTION 
Grade substitution is not permitted. Grade substitution 
occurs when 
(a) the material contains an element (other than nitro­
gen) that is unspecified for one of the grades marked 
(b) the amount of that element present in the material 
meets the minimum and maximum composition limits for 
that element in another grade of a specification contained 
in Section II, Part A or Part B, whether or not it is also so 
marked 
For example, a material meets all of the composition 
limits for SA-240 304, contains 0.06C and 0.02N, but also 
contains 0.45% Ti. This material cannot be marked or 
provided as meeting SA-240 304 because the Ti content 
meets the requirements of SA-240 321 [which is Ti great­
er than Sx (C + N) but less than 0.70]. 
Another material, with identical composition, except 
0.35% Ti, may be marked SA-240 304 because the Ti con­
tent does not meet the minimum requirement for 321. 
The Ti content is just a residual. 
111-240 MARKING SELECTION 
If a material is marked with specifications, grades, 
classes, or types, it may be used with the allowable stress­
es, design stress intensities, or ratings appropriate for any 
of the markings on the material, as long as the material 
specification, grade, class, and type is permitted by the 
code of construction governing the boiler, vessel, or com­
ponent in which the material is to be used. However, once 
the designer has selected which marking applies (specifi­
cation, grade, class, type, etc.), the designer must use all 
the design values appropriate for that selection and 
may not mix and match values from any other specifica­
tions, grades, classes, types, etc., with which the material 
may be marked.
