ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-369/SA-369M (ASTM A369/A369M) 
chemical composition thus determined, or that determined 
from a product analysis made by the tubular product 
manufacturer, shall conform to the requirements specified. 
7.2 In the case of large ingots poured from two or more 
heats, the weighted average of the chemical determinations of 
the several heats, made in accordance with 7.1, shall conform 
to the requirements specified in Section 6. 
8. Product Analysis 
8.1 At the request of the purchaser, a product analysis shall 
be made by the manufacturer on every heat. 
8.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the 
purchaser or his representative, and shall conform to the 
requirements specified in Section 6. 
8.3 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in Section 7 
or Section 8 does not conform to the requirements specified in 
Section 6 an analysis of each billet or pipe from the same heat 
may be made, and all billets or pipes conforming to the 
requirements shall be accepted. 
9. Tensile Requirements 
9 .1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. Tests for acceptance 
shall be made after final heat treatment of the forging. 
9.2 For Grade FP91 Type 1 and Type 2, when requested by 
the purchaser, the tensile and hardness properties shall be met 
and verified on material taken from the half-thickness location. 
10. Mechanical Tests Required 
10.1 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One test 
shall be made on a specimen from one end of one length of 
pipe representing each heat in each heat-treatment lot. 
10.2 Flattening Test-For pipe NPS 14 or less, and diameter 
to wall thickness ratios of more than 7 .0, a flattening test shall 
be carried out in accordance with Specification A999/ A999M. 
A test shall be carried out on a specimen taken from one end of 
each length of pipe. 
10.3 Bend Test-For pipe larger than NPS 14 or NPS where 
diameters to wall thickness ratio is 7 .0 or less, a bend test shall 
be carried out in accordance with Test Methods E290. Unless 
otherwise specified, the test specimens shall be taken in a 
transverse direction. The diameter of the pin shall be 2/3 t for 
longitudinal specimens or 1 1/3 t for transverse specimens, 
where t is the specimen thickness. The bend test specimens 
shall be bent at room temperature through 180° without 
cracking. One bend test shall be taken from one end of each 
length of pipe. 
11. Workmanship 
11.1 The pipe shall conform to the sizes and shapes speci­
fied by the purchaser. 
12. Ends 
12.1 Pipe ends shall be machined as specified in the 
purchase order. 
13. Finish 
13.1 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight and shall 
have a workmanlike finish. 
13.2 Repair of defects by welding shall be permitted only 
subject to the approval of the purchaser. Defects shall be 
thoroughly chipped or ground out before welding. Only quali­
fied operators and procedures in accordance with the ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX, shall be used. 
Local or full heat treatment in accordance with 5.4 shall follow 
welding. Local grinding following welding and retreating shall 
be considered as meeting the requirements of 5.3. 
14. Product Marking 
14.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A999/A999M, the marking shall include the wall thickness, 
piece mark, length, and additional symbol "S" if the pipe 
conforms to the supplementary requirements specified in 
Supplementary Requirements Sl to S5, and the heat number or 
the manufacturer's number by which the heat can be identified. 
Indentation stamping, instead of stenciling, will be permitted 
only with the written approval of the purchaser. 
14.2 For FP91, additional marking shall include the appro­
priate Type.
