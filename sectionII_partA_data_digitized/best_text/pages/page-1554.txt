and 2, in Grades 45 [310], 50 [340], 55 [380], 60 [410], 65 
[450], and 70 [480] in Classes 1 and 2). 
4.1.11 High-strength Low-alloy Steel with Improved Form­
ability (HSLAS-F Grades 50 [340], 60 [410], 70 [480], and 80 
[550]). 
4.1.11.1 HSLAS-F steel has improved formability when 
compared to HSLAS. The steel is fully deoxidized, made to 
fine grain practice and includes microalloying elements such as 
columbium, vanadium, zirconium, and so forth. The steel shall 
be treated to achieve inclusion control.

4.1.13 Bake Hardenable Steel (BHS). 
4.1.14 Required Hardness Steel (RHS). 
4.1.15 Full Hard Steel (FHS). 
4.2 When required for HSLAS and HSLAS-F steels, limi­
tations on the use of one or more of the microalloy elements 
shall be specified on the order. 
4.3 Cold-rolled steel sheet is supplied for either exposed or 
unexposed applications. Within the latter category, cold-rolled 
sheet is specified either "temper rolled" or "annealed last" or 
"full hard." For details on processing, attributes and 
limitations, and inspection standards, refer to Specification 
A568/ A568M. 
5. Ordering Information 
5.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order all ordering information necessary to describe 
the required material. Examples of such information include, 
but are not limited to, the following: 
5.1.1 ASTM specification number and year of issue. 
5.1.2 Name of material and designation (cold-rolled steel 
sheet) (include grade, type, and class, as appropriate, for CS, 
DS, DDS, EDDS, SFS, SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, RHS, FHS, 
SHS, or BHS) (see 4.1). 
5.1.2.1 When a Chemistry grade is specified in accordance 
with Specification A568/A568M Table X2.3, the grade shall be 
furnished as CS Type B - 1008, DS Type A - 1005, and so 
forth. 
5.1.2.2 When a Chemistry grade is specified in accordance 
with Specification A568/ A568M Table X2; 1, with no reference 
to CS Type A, CS Type B, DS Type A, DS Type B, or SFS, the 
grade shall be furnished as CS - 1005, CS - 1008, CS - 1020, 
and so forth, and meet chemistry specified in accordance with 
Specification A568/A568M Table X2.l. 
5.1.2.3 When a type is not specified for CS or DS and there 
is no reference to a chemistry grade such as 1005, 1006, and so 
forth, Type B will be furnished (see 4.1). 
5.1.2.4 When SFS is specified, a chemistry grade designa­
tion shall also be specified in accordance with Specification 
A568/A568M Table X2.1 (that is, 1010, 1020, and so forth), or 
carbon and manganese in accordance with Specification A568/ 
A568M Table X2.2 (that is, C 0.12 % to 0.18 %, Mn 0.50 % to 
0.80 %, and so forth). The characteristics identifying the 
enhanced formability or mechanical properties shall be speci­
fied by the user or purchaser, on the purchase order. If 
requested, the producer or seller shall provide verification of 
special practices or mechanical properties supporting enhanced 
formability. 
5.1.2.5 When a class is not specified for HSLAS, Class 1 
will be furnished (see 4.1). 
5.1.2.6 When a type is not specified for SS 33 [230] and SS 
40 [275], Type 1 will be furnished (see 4.1). 
5.1.3 Classification (either exposed, unexposed, temper 
rolled, or annealed last) (see 4.3). 
5.1.4 Finish (see 9.1). 
5.1.5 Oiled or not oiled, as required (see 9.2). 
5.1.6 Dimensions (thickness, width, and whether cut lengths 
or coils). 
Norn 1-Not all producers are capable of meeting all the limitations of 
the thickness tolerance tables in Specification A568/A568M. The pur­
chaser should contact the producer regarding possible limitations prior to 
placing an order. 
5.1.7 Coil size (must include inside diameter, outside 
diameter, and maximum weight). 
5.1.8 Copper bearing steel (if required). 
5.1.9 Quantity. 
5.1.10 Application (part identification and description). 
5.1.11 A report of heat analysis will be supplied, if 
requested, for CS, DS, DDS, EDDS, SFS, RHS, and FHS. For 
materials with required mechanical properties, SS, HSLAS, 
HSLAS-F, SHS, and BHS, a report is required of heat analysis 
and mechanical properties as determined by the tension test. 
5.1.12 Special requirements (if any). 
5 .1.12.1 When the purchaser requires thickness tolerances 
for 3 /s in. [10 mm] minimum edge distance (see Supplementary 
Requirement in Specification A568/A568M), this requirement 
shall be specified in the purchase order or contract. 
5.1.12.2 Tighter requirements can be specified based on 
agreement between seller and purchaser. 
Norn 2-A typical ordering description is as follows:

6.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A568/A568M unless otherwise provided herein. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The heat analysis of the steel shall conform to the 
chemical composition requirements of the appropriate desig­
nation shown in Table 1 for CS, DS, DDS, EDDS, and SFS, 
and in Table 2 for SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, SHS, and BHS. 
7 .2 Each of the elements listed in Tables 1 and 2, and 
Specification A568/ A568M Table X2.3 shall be included in the

chromium, or molybdenum is less than 0.02 %, report the 
analysis as <0.02 % or the actual determined value. When the 
amount of vanadium, columbium, or titanium is less than 
1500
