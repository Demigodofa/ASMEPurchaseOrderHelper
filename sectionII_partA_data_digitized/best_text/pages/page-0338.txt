0 Accelerated cooling from the normalizing temperature shall be permitted for section thicknesses greater than 3 in. [75 mm]. 
EAccelerated air cooling or liquid quenching shall be permitted for Class 2. 
F Quenched in water or rapidly cooled by other means, at a rate sufficient to prevent re-precipitation of carbides, as demonstrable by the capability of tubes, heat treated 
by either separate solution annealing or by direct quenching, passing Practices A262, Practice E. The manufacturer is not required to run the test unless it is specified on 
the purchase order (see Supplementary Requirement S4). Note that Practices A262 requires the test to be performed on sensitized specimens in the low-carbon and 
stabilized types and on specimens representative of the as-shipped condition for other types. In the case of low-carbon types containing 3 % or more molybdenum, the 
applicability of the sensitizing treatment prior to testing shall be a matter for negotiation between the seller and the purchaser. 
0 A maximum solution treating temperature of 2100 °F [1150 °CJ is recommended for UNS S21500. 
HA solution treating temperature above 1950 °F [1065 °CJ may impair resistance to intergranular corrosion after subsequent exposure to sensitizing conditions in the 
indicated grades. When specified by the purchaser, a lower temperature stabilization or resolution anneal shall be used subsequent to the higher-temperature solution 
anneal prescribed in this table. 
1 Solution treatment shall be preceded by a softening heat treatment prior to cold-working. The softening temperature shall be at least 90 °F [50 °C] higher than the solution 
heat treatment temperature, which shall be at 2150 °F [1180 °C] minimum.

ments selected. 
5. General Requirements 
5 .1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification Al016/A1016M, including 
any supplementary requirements that are indicated in the 
purchase order. Failure to comply with the general require­
ments of Specification Al016/A1016M constitutes nonconfor­
mance with this specification. In case of conflict between the 
requirements of this specification and Specification A1016/ 
Al016M, this specification shall prevail. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 Manufacture and Condition-Tubes shall be made by 
the seamless process and shall be either hot finished or cold 
finished, as specified. Grade TP34 7HFG shall be cold finished. 
6.2 Heat Treatment: 
286 
6.2.l Ferritic Alloy and Ferritic Stainless Steels-The fer­
ritic alloy and ferritic stainless steels shall be reheated for heat 
treatment in accordance with the requirements of Table 3. Heat 
treatment shall be carried out separately and in addition to 
heating for hot forming. 
6.2.2 Austenitic Stainless Steels-AU austenitic tubes shall 
be furnished in the heat-treated condition, and shall be heat 
treated in accordance with the requirements of Table 3. 
Alternatively, immediately after hot forming, while the tem­
perature of the tubes is not less than the minimum solution or 
stabilization treatment temperature specified in Table 3, tubes 
may be individually quenched in water or rapidly cooled by 
other means (direct quenched). 
6.3 If any controlled structural characteristics are required, 
these shall be so specified in the order as to be a guide as to the 
most suitable heat treatment. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 Composition Requirements: 
7 .1.1 The alloy steels shall conform to the chemical require­
ments given in Table 1. 
7.1.2 The stainless steels shall conform to the chemical 
requirements given in Table 2. 
7.2 Product Analysis:
