Note- The above table gives the computed minimum elongation values for each 1/32-in. decrease in wall thickness. Where the wall thickness lies between two values 
shown above, the minimum elongation value is determined by the following equation: 
Grade Direction of Test Equation 
I transverse E = 321 + 6.50 
E = 481 + 15.00 I longitudinal 
where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. in % and 
t = actual thickness of specimen, in. 
state "Not Hydrostatically Tested," and the specification num­
ber and grade designation, as shown on the certification, shall 
be followed by the letters "NH."

13. Dimensions, Weight, and Permissible Variations 
13.l Weight-The weight of any length of pipe shall not 
vary more than 6.5 % over and 3.5 % under that specified for 
pipe of Schedule 120 (Table Xl.2) and lighter nor more than 
10 % over and 3.5 % under that specified for pipe heavier than 
Schedule 120. Unless otherwise agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and purchaser, pipe in sizes NPS 4 [DN 100] and 
smaller may be weighed in convenient lots; pipe in sizes larger 
than NPS 4 [DN 100] shall be weighed separately. 
13.2 Diameter-Variations in outside diameter shall not 
exceed those specified in Table 3. 
13.3 Thickness-The minimum wall thickness at any point 
shall not be more than 12.5 % under the nominal wall thickness 
specified.

Appendix XI. 
14. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
14.1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient num­
ber of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable 
assurance that they have been properly evaluated with respect 
to depth. Exploration of all surface imperfections is not 
required but may be necessary to assure compliance with 14.2. 
14.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 12½ % 
of the nominal wall thickness or encroach on the minimum 
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with such 
defects shall be given one of the following dispositions:
