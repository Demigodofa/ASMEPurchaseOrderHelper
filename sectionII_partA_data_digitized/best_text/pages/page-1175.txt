6.1.16 Packaging, marking, and loading. 
7. Sampling 
7.1 Tension and bend-test specimens of sheet, strip, 
and plate products shall be selected from finished material 
and shall be selected in the transverse direction, except in 
the case of strip under 9 in. (229 mm) in width, in which 
case tension test specimens shall be selected in the longitu­
dinal direction. 
7.2 Flat bar tension and bend-test specimens shall be 
selected from the finished material and shall be in the 
longitudinal direction. 
7.3 Corrosion samples, if required, shall be taken from 
material after final annealing and descaling and prior to 
cold working. 
8. Number of Tests 
8.1 For cold-worked product produced in coil form, 
one tension test shall be made from each end of each coil. 
One bend test shall be made from one end of each coil. 
8.2 For cold-worked flat bar and plate products, two 
tension test and one bend test shall be made on each size 
of flat bar and each thickness of plate from each heat in a 
lot annealed in a single charge or under the same conditions 
in a continuous furnace. 
8.3 Annealed material produced to Table 2 require­
ments shall be tested in accordance with Specification 
A 480/ A 480M. 
9. Test Meth.ods 
9.1 Tension Test: 
9.1.1 The yield strength shall be determined by the 
offset method as described in Test Methods and Definitions 
A 370. An alternative method of determining field strength 
may be used based on the following total extension 
under load: 
Yield Strength, min. psi 
45 000 
75 000 
110 000 
135 000 
140 000 
Total Extension under Load in 2 in. 
Gage Length, incl. 
0.0071 
0.0098 
0.0125 
0.0144 
0.0148 
9.1.2 The requirement of this specification for yield 
strength will be considered as having been fulfilled if the 
extension under load for the specified yield strength does 
not exceed the specified values. The values obtained in 
this manner should not, however, be taken as the actual 
yield strength for 0.2%. In case of dispute, the offset 
method of determining yield strength shall be used. 
9.2 Bend Test: 
9.2.1 Bend-test specimens shall withstand cold bend­
ing without cracking when subjected to either the free­
bend method or the controlled-bend (V-block) method at 
the condition specified by Table 3 or Table 4, respectively. 
Specimens shall be bent around a diameter equal to the 
product of the bend factor times the specified thickness of 
the test specimen. The choice of test method for materials 
in conditions other than annealed shall be at the option of 
the seller. 
9.2.2 Free-bend test specimens shall be bent cold, 
either by pressure or by blows. However, in the case of 
dispute, tests shall be made by pressure. 
9.2.3 Controlled-bend (V-block) test specimens shall 
be bent cold by means of V-blocks or a mating punch 
and die having an included angle of 45° and with proper 
curvature of surface at the bend areas to impart the desired 
shape and diameter of bend to the specimen.
