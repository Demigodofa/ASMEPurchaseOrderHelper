ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-480/SA-480M (ASTM A480/A480M) 
another through the furnace. Interspersement of different melts is permis­
sible if they are of approximately the same nominal thickness and are heat 
treated in the same operating period and under the same conditions ( time 
and temperature). 
16.1.3 One intergranular corrosion test, when required, shall 
be selected from each heat and thickness subjected to the same 
heat treatment practice. It is permitted to obtain such speci­
mens from specimens selected for mechanical testing. 
17. Test Specimens 
17.1 Tension Test: 
17 .1.1 Tension test specimens shall be taken from finished 
material and shall be selected in either or both longitudinal and 
transverse direction. The tension test specimen shall conform 
to the appropriate sections of Test Methods and Definitions 
A370, unless otherwise specified in the applicable material 
specification or agreed upon by the seller and the purchaser. 
17 .1.2 The testing speed between the yield strength and the 
fracture of the specimen, shall be conducted at a constant strain 
rate between 1/s in. and ½ in. [3.18 mm and 12.70 mm] 
inclusive, per in. [25.40 mm] of gauge length per minute, or at 
a crosshead speed that will give a strain rate within this range. 
For the purposes of this specification, the rate of strain shall be 
determined by a strain-rate pacer, indicator, or controller, or by 
dividing the unit elongation by the elapsed time from yield 
strength to fracture. 
17.2 Hardness Test-It is permitted to perform hardness 
tests on the grip ends of the tension specimens before they are 
subjected to the tension test. 
17.2.1 Unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, the 
manufacturer may use an alternate hardness test procedure 
when material size or form dictates. Hardness conversion shall 
be done using the applicable tables in Test Methods and 
Definitions A370. When the material is too thin to allow 
hardness testing using any of the Rockwell superficial hardness 
tests, the hardness requirement is waived. 
17.3 Bend Test: 
17.3,1 Bend test specimens (when required) shall be taken 
from finished material and shall be selected in the transverse 
direction or as indicated in the applicable material specification 
or as agreed upon by the seller and the purchaser. In the case 
of transverse bend test specimens, the axis of bend shall be 
parallel to the direction of rolling. 
17.3.2 Bend test specimens from sheet and strip product 
shall be the full thickness of the material and approximately 
1 in. [25.4 mm] in width. It is permitted to round the edges of 
the test specimen to a radius equal to one half the specimen 
thickness. 
17.3.3 The width of strip for which bend tests can be made 
is subject to practical limitations on the length of the bend test 
specimen. For narrow strip, the following widths can be tested: 
Minimum Strip Width 
Strip Thickness, in. [mm] and Minimum Specimen Length for 
Bend Tests, in. [mm] 
0.100 [2.5] and under ½ [12.7] 
Over 0.100 to 0.140 [2.5 to 3.5], excl 1 [25.4] 
0.140 [3.5] and over 1 ½ [38.1] 
Bend test specimens shall be of any suitable length over the 
specified minimum length. 
17.3.4 Bend test specimens taken from plates shall be in full 
thickness of the material up to and including ½ in. [12.7 mm] 
in thickness, of suitable length, and between 1 in. and 2 in. 
[25.4 mm and 50.8 mm] in width. It is permitted to remove the 
sheared edges to a depth of at least 1/s in. [3.2 mm] and it is 
permitted to smooth the sides with a file. It is permitted to 
break the corners of the cross section of the specimen with a 
file, but no appreciable rounding of the corners is permitted. 
17.3.5 In the case of plates over ½in. [12.7 mm] in 
thickness, it is permitted to use bend test specimens, machined 
to 1 in. [25.4 mm] nominal width by½ in. [12.7 mm] nominal 
thickness and at least 6 in. [152.4 mm] in length. One surface, 
to be the outside surface in bending, shall be the original 
surface of the plate; however, surface preparation by light 
grinding is permitted. It is permitted to round the edges to a 
1/16 in. [1.6 mm] radius. When agreed by the seller and the 
purchaser, it is permitted to modify the cross section to ½ in. 
[12.7 mm] nominal square. 
17.3.6 In the case of plates over 1 in. [25.4 mm] in 
thickness, bend tests must be agreed upon between the seller 
and the purchaser. 
17.3.7 The bend test specimen shall withstand cold bending 
through the angle specified in the applicable material specifi­
cation without cracking on the outside of the bent portion. 
17.4 The bend shall be made over a diameter equal to the 
number of thicknesses of flat stock shown in the applicable 
material specification or over a single piece of flat stock equal 
to the number of thicknesses shown in the applicable material 
specification; or as follows: 
17.4.1 Material up to and including 3/s in. [9.5 mm] in 
thickness shall be bent over a piece ( or pieces) of flat stock that 
has the same nominal thickness of the material being tested 
(1 T), allowing the test material to form its natural curvature. 
17.4.2 Material over 3 /s in. [9.5 mm] and up to and including 
1 in. [25.4 mm] in thickness shall be bent over a piece (or 
pieces) of flat stock equalling two times the thickness of the 
material being tested (2T), allowing the test material to form its 
natural curvature. 
18. Special Tests 
18.1 If other tests are required, the methods and acceptance 
criteria shall be agreed upon between the seller and the 
purchaser and specified on the purchase order.

18.2 Resistance to Intergranular Corrosion: 
18.2.1 The intergranular corrosion test, Practice E of Prac­
tices A262, is not required unless it is specified on the purchase 
order. All austenitic chromium-nickel types except the H types 
are expected to be capable of passing this test. However, it is 
not necessary to actually run the test unless it is specified on the 
purchase order. Note that Practices A262 requires the test to be 
performed on sensitized specimens in the low-carbon and 
stabilized types and on specimens representative of the as­
shipped condition for other types. In the case of low-carbon 
types containing 3 % or more molybdenum in their specified 
composition, the applicability of the sensitizing treatment prior 
to testing shall be a matter for negotiation between the . seller 
and the purchaser. When specified, all flat rolled products of 
the chromium-nickel series (300 series) in thickness up to and
