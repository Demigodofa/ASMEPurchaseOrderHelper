ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-999 /SA-999M 
for ferritic/austenitic stainless steel pipe. The test pressure or 
stress shall be detennined using the following equation: 
P = 2St/D or S = PD/2t 
where: 
P = hydrostatic test pressure in psi [MPa], 
S = pipe wall stress in psi or [MPa], 
(3) 
t = specified wall thickness, nominal wall thickness accord­
ing to specified ANSI schedule number, or 1.143 times 
the specified minimum wall thickness, in. [mm], and 
D = specified outside diameter, outside diameter correspond­
ing to specified ANSI pipe size, or outside diameter 
calculated by adding 2t (as defined above) to the 
specified inside diameter, in. [mm]. 
22.2.1.1 The hydrostatic test pressure dete1mined by Eq 3 
shall be rounded to the nearest 50 psi [0.5 MPa] for pressures 
below 1000 psi [7 MPa], and to the nearest 100 psi [l MPa] for 
pressures 1000 psi [7 MPa] and above. The hydrostatic test 
may be performed prior to cutting to final length, or prior to 
upsetting, swaging, expanding, bending, or other forming 
operations. 
22.2.2 Regardless of pipe-wall stress-level determined by 
Eq 3, the minimum hydrostatic test pressure required to satisfy 
these requirements need not exceed 2500 psi [17.0 MPa] for 
outside diameters (see D in 22.2) of 3.5 in. [88.9 mm] or less, 
or 2800 psi [19.0 MPa] for outside diameters over 3.5 in. [88.9 
mm]. This does not prohibit testing at higher pressures at the 
option of the manufacturer or as allowed by 22.2.3. 
22.2.3 With concurrence of the manufacturer, a minimum 
hydrostatic test pressure in excess of the requirements of 22.1 
or 22.2, or both, may be stated in the purchase order. 
22.2.4 The test pressure shall be held for a minimum of 5 s. 
For welded pipe, the test pressure shall be held for a time 
sufficient to permit the entire length of the welded seam to be 
inspected. 
22.2.5 The hydrostatic test may not be capable of testing the 
end portion of the pipe. The length of pipe that cannot be tested 
shall be determined by the manufacturer and, if specified in the 
purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
22.3 Nondestructive Electric Test: 
22.3.1 Each pipe shall be examined with a nondestructive 
test in accordance with Practices E213, E309, E426, or E570. 
Unless specifically called out by the purchaser, the selection of 
the nondestructive electric test shall be at the option of the 
manufacturer. Upon agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer, Practice E273 shall be employed in addition to 
one of the full periphery tests. The range of pipe sizes that may 
be examined by each method shall be subject to the limitations 
in the scope of the respective practices. 
22.3.2 The following information is for the benefit of the 
user of this specification: 
22.3.2.1 The reference discontinuities defined in 22.3.8.2 -
22.3.8. 7 are convenient standards for the standardization of 
nondestructive testing equipment. The dimensions of such 
reference discontinuities should not be construed as the mini­
mum size imperfection detectable by such equipment. 
22.3.2.2 The ultrasonic testing (UT) can be performed to 
detect both longitudinally and circumferentially oriented im-
perfections. It should be recognized that different techniques 
should be used to detect differently oriented imperfections. The 
examination may not detect short deep imperfections. 
22.3.2.3 The eddy-current testing (ET) referenced in this 
specification, (see Practices E426 and E309), has the capability 
of detecting significant imperfections, especially of the short 
abrupt type. The sensitivity of this test decreases with wall 
thickness over 0.250 in. (6.4 mm). 
22.3.2.4 The flux leakage examination referred to in this 
specification is capable of detecting the presence and location 
of significant longitudinally or transversely oriented imperfec­
tions; however, sensitivity of the test to various types of 
imperfections is affected by the calibration, and different 
techniques should be employed to detect differently oriented 
imperfections. 
22.3.2.5 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of imperfections that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
22.3.3 Time of Examination: 
22.3.3.1 Nondestructive testing for specification acceptance 
shall be performed after all mechanical processing, heat 
treatments, and straightening operations. This requirement 
does not preclude additional testing at earlier stages in the 
processing. 
22.3.4 Su-rjace Condition: 
22.3.4.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, 
paint, and other foreign material that could interfere with 
interpretation of test results. The methods used for cleaning 
and preparing the surfaces for examination shall not be 
detrimental to the base metal or the surface finish. 
22.3.4.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can 
produce signals that interfere with the test. 
22.3.5 Extent of Examination: 
22.3.5.1 The relative motion of the pipe and the 
transducer(s), coil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire 
pipe surface is scanned, except as allowed by 22.3.5.2. 
22.3.5.2 The existence of end effects is recognized, and the 
extent of such effects shall be detennined by the manufacturer, 
and, if requested, shall be reported to the purchaser. Other 
nondestructive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
22.3.6 Operator Qualifications: 
22.3.6.1 The test unit operator shall be qualified in accor­
dance • with SNT-TC- lA, or an equivalent recognized and 
documented standard. 
22.3.7 Test Conditions: 
22.3.7.1 For eddy-current testing, the excitation coil fre­
quency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration yet 
provide a good signal-to-noise ratio. 
22.3.7.2 The eddy-current coil frequency used shall not 
exceed the following: 
On specified walls up to 0.050 in. [1.3 mm] - 100 kHz 
On specified walls up to 0.150 in. [3.8 mm] - 50 kHz 
On specified walls equal to or greater than 0.150 in. [3.8 mm] - 10 kHz
