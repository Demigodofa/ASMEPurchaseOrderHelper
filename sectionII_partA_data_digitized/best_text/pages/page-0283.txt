7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The steel shall conform to the following requirements as 
to chemical composition: 
Carbon, % 0.06-0.18 
Manganese, % 0.27-0.63 
Phosphorus, max, % 0.035 
Sulfur, max, % 0.035 
Silicon, max, % 0.25 
7 .2 Supplying an alloy grade of steel that specifically 
requires the addition of any element other than those listed in 
7.1 is not permitted. 
8. Product Analysis 
8.1 When requested on the purchase order, a product analy­
sis shall be made by the supplier from one tube per 100 pieces 
for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm] and one tube per 250 pieces for 
sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under; or when tubes are identified 
by heat, one tube per heat shaU be analyzed. The chemical 
composition thus determined shall conform to the requirements 
specified. 
8.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional billets or tubes shall be made. Both retests, for 
the elements in question, shall meet the requirements of the 
specification; otherwise all remaining material in the heat or lot 
(see Note 1) shall be rejected or, at the option of the producer, 
each billet or tube may be individually tested for acceptance. 
Billets or tubes which do not meet the requirements of the 
specification shall be rejected. 
Nom l-A lot consists of 250 tubes for sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under 
and of 100 tubes for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm), prior to cutting to length. 
9. Hardness Requirements 
9.1 The tubes shall have a hardness number not exceeding 
the following: 
Brinell Hardness Number (Tubes 
0.200 in. [5.1 mm] and over in 
wall thickness) 
137 HBW 
Rockwell Hardness Number 
(Tubes less than 0.200 in. 
[5.1 mm] in wall thickness) 
77 HRBW 
10. Mechanical Tests Required 
10.1 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of two tubes selected from each lot 
(see Note 1) or fraction thereof. 
10.2 Flaring Test-One flaring test shall be made on speci­
mens from each end of two tubes selected from each lot (see 
Note 1) or fraction thereof. These tubes shall be selected apart 
from those used for the flattening test. 
10.3 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot. The 
term lot applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same 
nominal diameter and wall thickness which are produced from 
the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a 
batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the 
same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the same 
furnace charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous 
furnace, a lot shall include all tubes of the same size and heat, 
heat treated in the same furnace at the same temperature, time 
at heat, and furnace speed. 
10.4 Hydrostatic Test-Each tube shall be subjected to the 
hydrostatic pressure test, or instead of this test, a nondestruc­
tive test may be used when specified by the purchaser. 
11. Forming Operations 
11.1 Tubes when inserted in the boiler shall stand expanding 
and beading without showing cracks or flaws. Superheater 
tubes when properly manipulated shall stand all forging, 
welding, and bending operations necessary for application 
without developing defects. 
12. Product Marking 
12.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A450/A450M, the marking shall indicate whether the tube is 
hot finished or cold finished. 
13. Keywords 
13.1 boiler tubes; seamless steel tube; steel tube-carbon
