6.3 Product Analysis-Product analysis requirements and 
options, if any, are contained in the product specification. 
7. Tensile Properties 
7 .1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in the individual specification. 
7 .2 The yield strength corresponding to a permanent offset 
of 0.2 % of the gage length or to a total extension of 0.5 % of 
the gage length under load shall be determined. 
7.3 If the percentage of elongation of any test specimen is 
less than that specified and any part of the fracture is more than 
¾ in. [19.0 mm] from the center of the gage length, as 
indicated by scribe marks on the specimen before testing, a 
retest shall be allowed. 
8. Standard Weights 
8.1 The calculated weight per unit length, based upon a 
specified minimum wall thickness, shall be determined by the 
following equation: 
W= C(D - t)t 
where: 
C = 10.69 [0.0246615], 
W == weight, lb/ft [kg/m], 
D = specified outside diameter, in. [mm], and 
t = specified minimum wall thickness, in. [mm) 
(1) 
8.2 The permissible variations from the calculated weight 
per foot [kilogram per metre] shall be as prescribed in Table 1. 
9. Permissible Variations in Wall Thickness 
9.1 Variations from the specified minimum wall thickness 
shall not exceed the amounts prescribed in Table 2. 
9.2 For tubes 2 in. [50.8 mm] and over in outside diameter 
and 0.220 in. [5.6 mm] and over in thickness, the variation in 
wall thickness in any one cross section of any one tube shall 
not exceed the following percentage of the actual mean wall at 
the section. The actual mean wall is defined as the average of 
the thickest and thinnest wall in that section. 
Seamless tubes ± 10 % 
Welded tubes ±5 % 
9.3 When cold-finished tubes as ordered require wall thick­
nesses¾ in. [19.1 mm] or over, or an inside diameter 60 % or 
less of the outside diameter, the permissible variations in wall 
thickness for hot-finished tubes shall apply.

sizes over 4 in. [101.6 mm] in outside diameter.

A These permissible variations in wall thickness apply only to tubes, except 
internal-upset tubes, as rolled or cold-finished, and before swaging, expanding, 
bending, polishing, or other fabricating operations. 
10. Permissible Variations in Outside Diameter 
10.1 Except as provided in 10.2, variations from the speci­
fied outside diameter shall not exceed the amounts prescribed 
in Table 3. 
10.2 Thin-wall tubes usually develop significant ovality (out 
of roundness) during final annealing, or straightening, or both. 
The diameter tolerances of Table 3 are not sufficient to provide 
for additional ovality expected in thin-wall tubes, and, for such 
tubes, are applicable only to the mean of the extreme (maxi­
mum and minimum) outside diameter readings in any one cross 
section. However, for thin wall tubes the difference in extreme 
outside diameter readings (ovality) in any one cross section 
shall not exceed the following ovality allowances: 
Outside Diameter 
1 in. [25.4 mm] and under 
Over 1 in. [25.4 mm] 
Ovality Allowance 
0.020 in. [0.5 mm]

A Except as provided in 10.2, these permissible variations include out-of­
roundness. These permissible variations in outside diameter apply to hot-finished 
seamless, welded and cold-finished seamless tubes before other fabricating 
operations such as upsetting, swaging, expanding, bending, or polishing.
