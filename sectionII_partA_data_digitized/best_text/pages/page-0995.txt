4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It shall be the responsibility of the purchaser to specify 
all requirements necessary for product under this specification. 
Such requirements to be considered include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (feet, meters, or number of lengths), 
4.1.2 Specification number with grade or class, or both, as 
applicable and year date, 
4.1.3 Manufacture (hot-finished or cold drawn), 
4.1.4 Size (NPS [DN] and weight class or schedule number, 
or both; outside diameter and nominal wall thickness; or inside 
diameter and nominal wall thickness), 
4.1.5 Length (specific or random), 
4.1.6 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test 
Methods A1058 when material is ordered to an M suffix (SI 
units) product standard. If the choice of test track is not 
specified in the order, then the default ASTM test track shall be 
used as noted in Test Methods A1058, 
4.1.7 Supplementary Requirements, and 
4.1.8 Additional requirements. 
5. Process 
5.1 The steel shall be made from any process. 
5.2 If a specific type of melting is required by the purchaser, 
it shall be stated on the purchase order. 
5.3 The primary melting may incorporate separate degas­
sing or refining and may be followed by secondary melting, 
using electroslag remelting or vacuum remelting. 
5.4 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When 
steel of different grades is sequentially strand cast, identifica­
tion of the resultant transition material is required. The 
producer shall remove the transition material by an established 
procedure that positively separates the grades. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 Chemical Analysis-Samples for chemical analysis and 
method of analysis shall be in accordance with Test Methods, 
Practices, and Terminology A751.

grade for which that element is a specified element having a

defined as an alloy described individually and identified by its 
own UNS designation in a table of chemical requirements 
within any specification listed within the scope as being 
covered by this specification.
