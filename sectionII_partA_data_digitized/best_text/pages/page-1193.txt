king for materials less than 5/s in. [16 mm] thick; greater than 
Vs in. [3 mm] long for materials from 5/s in. [16 mm] thick to 
under 2 in. [50 mm] thick; and greater than 3/16 in. [5 mm] long 
for materials 2 in. [50 mm] thick or greater.

in. [3 mm] for thicknesses less than 5/s in. [16 mm], and greater 
than 3/16 in. [5 mm] for thicknesses 5/s in. [16 mm] and greater. 
S6.2.3 Four or more indications in any line separated by V16 
in. [1 mm] or less edge-to-edge. 
S6.2.4 Ten or more indications in any 6 in.2 [39 cm 2 ] of 
surface with the major dimension of this area not to exceed 6 
in. [150 mm] when it is taken in the most unfavorable 
orientation relative to the indications being evaluated. 
S7. Magnetic Particle Examination of Weld Metal 
S7 .1 All accessible welds shall be examined in accordance 
with Guide E709. Accessible is defined as: All outside surfaces, 
all inside surfaces of pipe 24 in. [600 mm] in diameter and 
greater, and inside surfaces of pipe less than 24 in. [600 mm] 
in diameter for a distance of one pipe diameter from the ends. 
S7 .2 Acceptance Criteria-The following relevant indica­
tions are unacceptable: 
S7.2.1 Any cracks and linear indications. 
S7.2.2 Rounded indications with dimensions greater than 
3 /16 in. [5 mm]. 
S7.2.3 Four or more indications in any line separated by 1/16 
in. [1 mm] or less edge-to-edge. 
S7 .2.4 Ten or more indications in any 6 in.2 [39 cm 2 ] of 
surface with the major dimension of this area not to exceed 6 
in. [150 mm] when it is taken in the most unfavorable 
orientation relative to the indications being evaluated. 
SS. Liquid Penetrant Examination of Base Metal 
S8.1 All accessible surfaces of the pipe shall be examined in 
accordance with Test Method E165/E165M. Accessible is as 
defined in S7 .1. 
S8.2 The acceptance criteria shall be in accordance with 
S6.2. 
S9. Liquid Penetrant Examination of Weld Metal 
S9.1 All accessible surfaces of the pipe shall be examined in 
accordance with Test Method E165/E165M. Accessible is as 
defined in S7.1. 
S9.2 The acceptance criteria shall be in accordance with 
S7.2. 
SlO. Straight Beam Ultrasonic Examination of Flat 
Plate-UT 1 
Sl0.1 The plate shall be examined and accepted in accor­
dance with Specification A435/A435M except that 100 % of 
one surface shall be scanned by moving the search unit in 
parallel paths with not less than 10 % overlap. 
SU. Straight Beam Ultrasonic Examination of Flat 
Plate-UT 2 
S 11.1 The plate shall be examined in accordance with 
Specification A578/A578M except that 100 % of one surface 
shall be scanned and the acceptance criteria shall be as follows: 
S 11.1.1 Any area, where one or more discontinuities pro­
duce a continuous total loss of back reflection accompanied by 
continuous indications on the same plane that cannot be 
encompassed within a circle whose diameter is 3 in. [76.2 mm] 
or one half of the plate thickness, whichever is greater, is 
unacceptable. 
S 11.1.2 In addition, two or more discontinuities on the same 
plane and having the same characteristics but smaller than 
described above shall be unacceptable unless separated by a 
minimum distance equal to the largest diameter of the larger 
discontinuity or unless they may be collectively encompassed 
by the circle described above. 
S12. Angle Beam Ultrasonic Examination (Plate Less 
than 2 in. [50 mm] Thick)-UT 3 
Sl2.1 The plate shall be examined in accordance with 
Specification A577 / A577M except that the calibration notch 
shall be vee shaped and the acceptance criteria shall be as 
follows: Any area showing one or more reflections producing 
indications whose amplitude exceeds that of the calibration 
notch is unacceptable.
