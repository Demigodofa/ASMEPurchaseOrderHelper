SA-231/SA-231M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR CHROMIUM-VANADIUM ALLOY 
STEEL SPRING WIRE 
SA-231/SA-231M 
(Identical with ASTM Specification A 231/A 231M-96 except that certification reqnirements in para. 13.l are mandatory.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers round chromimn-vana­
dium alloy steel spring wire having properties and quality 
intended for the manufacture of springs used at moderately 
elevated temperatures. This wire shall be either in the 
annealed and cold-drawn or oil-tempered condition as spec­
ified by the purchaser. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI (metric) units or inch­
pound units are to be regarded separately as standard. The 
values stated in each system are not exact equivalents; 
therefore, each system must be used independent of the 
other.

NOTE 1 - A typical ordering description is as follows: 20,000 kg oil­
tempered chromium-vanadium alloy steel wire, size 6.00 mm in 150 kg 
coils to ASTM A 231M dated ____ , or for inch-pound units, 
40 000 lb oil-tempered chromium-vanadium alloy steel spring wire, size 
0.250 in. in 350 lb coils to ASTM A 231 dated. __ _ 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel may be made by any commercially 
accepted steel-making process. The steel may be either 
ingot cast or strand cast. 
4.2 The finished wire shall be free from detrimental 
pipe and undue segregation. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition specified in Table 3. 
5.2 Cast or Heat Analysis - Each cast or heat of steel 
shall be analyzed by the manufacturer to determine the
