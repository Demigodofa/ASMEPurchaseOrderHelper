1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers nickel-chromium-molyb­
denum alloy steel plates for use in the quenched and tem­
pered condition, intended for the fabrication of welded 
pressure vessels and other pressure equipment. These alloy 
compositions are normally considered for construction 
involving plate thicknesses of 2 in. [50 mm] or greater. 
1.2 Material under this specification is available in two 
types, B and C. The material is also available in three 
classes as follows: 
Class 
2 
3 
Minimum Tensile 
Strength, 
ksi [MPa] 
105 [725] 
115 [795] 
90 [620] 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification.

1.5 These alloy steel plates in the as-rolled condition 
are sensitive to cracking during flame cutting, transit, and 
handling. They should be shipped in the as-rolled condition 
only with the mutual agreement of the manufacturer and 
the purchaser or fabricator. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining

3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this specifi­
cation, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required 
to meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred 
to the listed supplementary requirements in this specifica­
tion and to the detailed requirements in Specification 
A20/A20M. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in con­
flict with the requirements of Specification A 20/ A 20M, 
the requirements of this specification shall prevail.
