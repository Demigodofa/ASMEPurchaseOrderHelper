INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Carbon and Alloy Steel 
Mechanical Tubing 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A513/A513M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon ( e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification covers electric-resistance-welded car­
bon and alloy steel tubing for use as mechanical tubing. 
1.2 This specification covers mechanical tubing made from 
hot- or cold-rolled steel. 
1.3 This specification covers round, square, rectangular, and 
special shape tubing.

1.3.1 Indeterminate wall thicknesses may be ordered. In 
those cases the more stringent tolerances of Tables 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 
10, 11, 12, 16, and 17 shall apply. When sizes within the 
allowable ranges lj.I'e ordered all other requirements of the 
specification shall be met. 
hard or rationalized conversions apply to diameters, lengths 
and tensile properties. Soft conversion applies to other SI 
measurements. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Tra1e (TBT) Committee.
