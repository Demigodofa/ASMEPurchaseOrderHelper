ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-213/SA-213M (ASTM A213/A213M) 
7 .2.1 An analysis of either one billet or one tube shall be 
made from each heat. The chemical composition thus deter­
mined shall conform to the requirements specified. 
7.2.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional billets or tubes shall be made. Both retests, for 
the elements in question, shall meet the requirements of the 
specification; otherwise all remaining material in the heat shall 
be rejected or, at the option of the producer, each billet or tube 
may be individually tested for acceptance. Billets or tubes that 
do not meet the requirements of the specification shall be 
rejected. 
8. Grain Size 
8.1 Grain size shall be as given in Table 3, as determined in 
accordance with Test Methods E112. 
8.2 Grain size determinations, to demonstrate compliance 
with 8.1, shall be made on one end of one finished tube from 
each lot. See 15.1. 
9. Mechanical Properties 
9.1 Tensile Requirements: 
9.1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties given in Table 4. 
9.1.2 Table 5 gives the computed minimum elongation 
values for each V32-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. 
Where the wall thickness lies between two values shown in 
Table 5, the minimum elongation value shall be determined by 
the following equations. For Grades T23, T24, T91, T92, T115, 
T122, Tl28, T911, T921, and S44400: E = 32t + 10.00 [E = 
1.25t + 10.00]. For Grade T36: E = 32t + 5.0 [E = 1.25t + 5.0]. 
For grade T93: E = 32t + 9.00 [E = l.25t + 9.00]. For all other 
ferritic alloy grades: E = 48t + 15.00 [E = l.87t + 15.00]. 
where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. [50 mm], %, and 
t = actual thickness of specimen, in. [mm]. 
9 .1.3 One tension test shall be made on a specimen from one 
tube for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall be 
made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes. See 15.2. 
9.2 Hardness Requirements: 
9 .2.1 The material shall conform to the hardness require­
ments given in Table 4. See 15.2. 
9.2.2 Brinell, Vickers, or Rockwell hardness tests shall be 
made on specimens from two tubes from each lot. See 15.2. 
9 .3 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used 
for the flaring test, from each lot. See 15.1. 
9.4 Flaring Test-One flaring test shall be made on speci­
mens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used for 
the flattening test, from each lot. See 15.1. 
9.5 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than Vs in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 
thinner than 0.015 in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
10. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
10.1 Each tube shall be subjected to the nondestructive 
electric test or the hydrostatic test. The type of test to be used 
shall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order. 
11. Forming Operations 
11.1 Tubes, when inserted in a boiler or tube sheet, shall 
stand expanding and beading without showing cracks or flaws. 
Superheater tubes when properly manipulated shall stand all 
forging, welding, and bending operations necessary for appli­
cation without developing defects. See Note 1. 
NOTE I-Certain of the ferritic steels covered by this specification will 
harden if cooled rapidly from above their critical temperature. Some will 
air harden, that is, become hardened to an undesirable degree when cooled 
in air from high temperatures, particularly chromium-containing steels 
with chromium of 4 % and higher. Therefore, operations that involve 
heating such steels above their critical temperatures, such as welding, 
flanging, and hot bending, should be followed by suitable heat treatment. 
12. Repair by Welding 
12.1 Repair welding shall be performed in conformance . 
with Specification A1016/A1016M. 
12.2 All repair welds in T91 shall be made with one of the 
following welding processes and consumables: SMAW, A5.5/ 
A5.5M E90XX-B9; SAW, A5.23/A5.23M EB9 + neutral flux; 
GTAW, A5.28/A5.28M ER90S-B9; and FCAW A5.29/A5.29M 
E91Tl-B9. In addition, the sum of the Ni+Mn content of all 
welding consumables used to weld repair T91 Types 1 and 2 
shall not exceed 1.0 %. 
12.3 All repair welds in T92, T93, T911, and T122, shall be 
made using welding consumables meeting the chemical re­
quirements for the grade in Table 1. 
13. Permissible Variations from the Specified Wall 
Thickness 
13.1 Permissible variations from the specified minimum 
wall thickness shall be in accordance with Specification 
A1016/A1016M. 
13.2 Permissible variations from the specified average wall 
thickness shall be ± 10 % of the specified average wall 
thickness for cold formed tubes and, unless otherwise specified 
by the purchaser, shall be in accordance with Table 6 for hot 
formed tubes. 
287 
14. Surface Condition 
14.1 Ferritic alloy cold-finished steel tubes shall be free of 
scale and suitable for inspection. A slight amount of oxidation 
is not considered scale. 
14.2 Ferritic alloy hot-finished steel tubes shall be free of 
loose scale and suitable. for inspection. • 
14.3 Stainless steel tubes shall be pickled free of scale. 
When bright annealing is used, pickling is not necessary. 
14.4 Any special finish requirement shall be subject to 
agreement between the supplier and the purchaser. 
15. Sampling 
15.1 For flattening, flaring, and grain size·requirements, the 
term lot applies to all tubes, prior to cutting, of the same size· 
(see 4.1.7) that are produced from the same heat of steel.When
