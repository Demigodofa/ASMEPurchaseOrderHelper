A Applicable !o bars 1 ½ in. (38 mm) in diameter tested full size. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The heat analysis shall conform to the requirements for 
chemical composition specified in Table 1. 
6.2 A product analysis of the steel may be made by the 
purchaser and shall conform to the requirements of Table 1 
subject to the product analysis tolerances specified in Specifi­
cation A29/ A29M. 
7. Tensile Requirements 
7. l Requirements: 
7.1. l The material, as represented by the test specimens, 
shall conform to the tensile requirements specified in Table 2. 
7.1.2 A deduction from the percentage of elongation speci­
fied in Table 2 of 1.0 % shall be made for each LO in. 
(25.4 mm) of specified diameter over 2.0 in. (51 nun) or 
fraction thereof to a maximum of 3 %. 
7.2 Specimens: 
7.2.1 Tension test specimens shall be taken longitudinally 
from a position midway between the center and the surface of 
the bar or as close as practical to this location for smaH sizes. 
7.2.2 When it is impractical to remove specimens in accor-
dance with 7.2.l, they shall be taken in accordance with Test 
Methods and Definitions A370. 
7 .3 Number c4' Tests-One tension test shall be made from 
each lot. A lot shall consist of all bars of one size from one heat 
processed at one time and subjected to the same heat treatment 
when heat treated. 
7.4 Test Methods-Tension tests shall be made in accor­
dance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. The yield 
strength shall be determined by the 0.2 % offset or 0.5 % 
extension under load methods. 
8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
8.1 Descaling-When descaled bars are required, Supple­
mentary Requirement S7 must be specified. 
8.2 The bars shall be free of visible pipe and conditioned as 
necessary to remove injurious surface imperfections. 
9. General Requirements 
9 .1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
fom1 to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A29/ A29M unless otherwise provided herein. 
10. Certification and Test Reports 
10.1 A manufacturer's certification that the material was 
manufactured and tested in accordance with this specification 
together with a repmt of the heat analysis and tension test 
results shall be furnished at the time of shipment. The repmt 
shall include the name of the manufacturer, ASTM designation 
number and grade, shape, size, and finish. 
11. Packaging and Package Marking 
11. l Bars less than 2.0 in. (51 mm) in diameter or thickness 
shall be tightly banded with a sufficient number of bands of 
adequate strength to minimize bundle breakage during han­
dling and shipping. Larger sizes shall be packaged in accor­
dance with Specification A29/ A29M. 
11.2 For bars less than 2.0 in. (51 mm) in diameter or 
thickness, each bundle shall bear a weather-resistant tag 
showing the purchase order number, ASTM designation num­
ber and grade, heat number, size, and name of manufacturer. 
ll.3 Bars 2.0 in. (51 mm) and larger in diameter or 
thickness shall have the heat number steel stamped on one end.
