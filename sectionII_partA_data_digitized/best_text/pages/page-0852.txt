SA-451/SA-451M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Centrifugally Cast Austenitic Steel Pipe for High­
Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers austenitic alloy steel pipe for 
use in high-temperature, corrosive, or nuclear pressure service. 
1.2 Several grades of austenitic stainless steel are covered as 
indicated in Table 1. 
1.3 Optional supplementary requirements are provided 
when additional testing may be required. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exactly equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of each other. Combining values from 
the two systems may result in nonconformance with the 
specification. 
Norn I-This specification is not intended to cover centrifugal pipe 
made from alloys containing more than 0.20 % carbon, such as are 
covered by Specification A297/A297M.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for material to this specification shall include the 
following, as required, to describe the desired material ad­
equately: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material (centrifugally cast pipe), 
3.1.3 Grade (Table 1), 
3.1.4 Size (outside or inside diameter and minimum wall 
thickness in inches or millimetres), 
3.1.5 Length (specific or random, Specification A999/ 
A999M), 
3.1.6 End Finish of Specification A999/A999M, 
3.1.7 Optional Requirements (9.4 and Supplementary Re­
quirements Sl through S7), 
3.1.8 Test Report Required (Section 14), and 
3.1.9 Special Requirements or Additions to Specification. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Heat-Treatment-The pipe shall receive a heat­
treatment at the temperature and time specified in Table 2, 
followed by a quench in water or rapid cool by other means. 
4.2 Machining-The pipe shall be machined on the inner 
and outer surfaces to a roughness value no greater than 
250-µin. [6.35-µm] arithmetical average deviation (AA) from 
the mean line, as defined in American National Standard 
B46.1.
