6.2 Flattening Test: 
6.2.1 A section of pipe not less than 4 in. (102 mm) in length 
shall be flattened cold between parallel plates in two steps. The 
weld shall be placed 90° from the direction of the applied 
force. During the first step, which is a test for ductility, no 
cracks or breaks, except as provided for in 6.2.5, shall occur on 
the inside or outside surfaces until the distance between the 
plates is less than the value of H, calculated by the following 
equation: 
H = [(1 +e)t]l[e+t!D] (1) 
where: 
H = distance between flattening plates, in., 
t = specified wall thickness of the pipe, in., 
D = specified outside diameter of the pipe, in., and 
e = deformation per unit length (0.09 for low-carbon steel). 
6.2.2 During the second step, which is a test for soundness, 
the flattening shall be continued until the specimen breaks or 
the opposite walls of the pipe meet. Evidence of laminated or 
unsound material, or of incomplete weld that is revealed during 
the entire flattening test shall be cause for rejection. 
6.2.3 Surface imperfections in the test specimens before 
flattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening 
test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements. 
6.2.4 Superficial ruptures resulting from surface imperfec­
tions shall not be cause for rejection. 
6.2.5 When low D-to- t ratio tubulars are tested, because the 
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the 
inside surface at the 6 and 12 o'clock locations, cracks at these 
locations shall not be cause for rejection if the D-to-t ratio is 
less than 10. 
6.3 Reverse Flattening Test-A section 4 in. ( 102 mm) in 
length of pipe in sizes down to and including 13 /16 in. (20.6 mm) 
in outside diameter shall be split longitudinally 90° on each 
side of the weld and the sample opened and flattened with the 
weld at the point of maximum bend. There shall be no evidence 
of cracks or lack of penetration or overlaps resulting from flash 
removal in the weld. 
6.4 Flange Test-A section of pipe not less than 4 in. (102 
mm) in length shall be capable of having a flange turned over 
at a right angle to the body of the pipe without cracking or 
showing flaws. This flange, as measured from the outside of the 
pipe, shall be not less than Vs in. (3.2 mm) nor more than½ in. 
(12.7 mm). Within these limits, the width of the flange shall be 
not less than the percentages specified in Table 4. 
7. Dimensions and Permissible Variations 
7.1 Permissible Variations in Outside Diameter and Wall 
Thickness-The outside diameter and wall thickness variations 
shall not exceed the limits prescribed in Table 1.

7 .2 Permissible Variations in Straightness-Bach pipe shall 
be straight within 0.030 in. (0.76 mm) maximum deflection in 
any 3 ft (0.91 m) length to 8 NPS. For 8 NPS and above, pipe 
shall be straight within 0.060 in. (1.52 mm) maximum deflec­
tion in any 3 ft (0.91 m) length. Galvanized pipe shall be 
reasonably straight. 
7.3 Lengths: 
7.3.1 Pipe may be ordered in definite cut lengths or in 
random lengths as provided herein. 
7.3.2 When ordered in definite cut lengths, the variation in 
length shall not exceed the amounts prescribed in Table 5. 
7.3.3 If definite lengths are not required, pipe may be 
ordered in single random lengths of 16 to 22 ft (4.9 to 6.7 m) 
with 5 % 12 to 16 ft (3.7 to 4.9 m), or in double random lengths 
with a minimum average of 35 ft (10.7 m) and a minimum 
length of 22 ft (6.7 m) with 5 % 16 to 22 ft (4.9 to 6.7 m). 
8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
8.1 The finished pipe shall be free of injurious defects and 
shall have a workman-like finish. Minor defects may be 
removed by grinding, provided the wall thickness is not 
reduced to less than the minimum thickness permitted for the 
ordered nominal wall thickness. 
8.2 The pipe shall have smooth ends free of burrs and free 
of scale except that the pipe may have a superficial "blue" 
oxide film on the surfaces. 
8.3 For NPS ½ to 1 ½ inclusive, the inside diameter welding 
flash shall be removed so that the remaining flash does not 
exceed 0.006 in. (0.15 mm). For NPS over 1 ½, the remaining 
inside diameter welding flash shall not exceed 0.010 in. (0.25 
mm). 
8.4 For all nominal sizes, the outside diameter welding flash 
shall be removed flush with the outside diameter contour. 
8.5 Undercut flash must be smoothly blended into the pipe 
wall. 
8.6 The intent of the flash conditions as prescribed in 8.3, 
8.4, and 8.5 is to obtain a surface contour suitable for flanging. 
9. Number of Tests 
9.1 Two tensile tests as specified in 6.1 shall be made from 
each heat. 
9 .2 The flattening test as specified in 6.2 shall be made on 
two lengths of pipe from each lot of 250 lengths or fraction 
thereof.

A These permissible variations In length apply to pipe before bending. They 
apply to cut lengths up to and including 24 ft (7.3 m). For lengths over 24 ft, an 
additional over-tolerance of 1/a in. for each 1 O ft (3.0 m) or fraction thereof shall be 
permissible, up to a maximum of½ in. (12.7 mm).
