ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-333/SA-333M 
this specification. The outside diameter at the point of grinding 
may be reduced by the amount so removed. 
10.5.l Wall thickness measurements shall be made with a 
mechanical caliper or with a properly calibrated nondestrnctive 
testing device of appropriate accuracy. In case of dispute, the 
measurement determined by use of the mechanical caliper shall 
govern. 
10.6 Weld repair shall be permitted only subject to the 
approval of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification 
A999/A999M. 
10.7 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight. 
11. General Requirements 
11.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the applicable requirements of the current edition of Specifi­
cation A999/A999M unless otherwise provided herein. 
12. Mechanical Testing 
12.l Sampling-For mechanical testing, the term "lot" ap­
plies to all pipe of the same nominal size and wall thickness ( or 
schedule) that is produced from the same heat of steel and 
subjected to the same finishing treatment in a continuous 
furnace. If the final heat treatment is in a batch-type furnace, 
the lot shall include only those pipes that are heat treated in the 
same furnace charge. 
12.2 Transverse or Longitudinal Tensile Test and Flattening 
Test-For material heat treated in a batch-type furnace, tests 
shall be made on 5 % of the pipe from each lot. If heat treated 
by the continuous process, tests shall be made on a sufficient 
number of pipe to constitute 5 % of the lot, but in no case less 
than 2 pipes. 
12.3 Impact Test-One notched bar impact test, consisting 
of breaking three specimens, shall be made from each heat 
represented in a heat-treatment load on specimens taken from 
the finished pipe. This test shall represent only pipe from the 
same heat and the same heat-treatment load, the wall thick­
nesses of which do not exceed by more than¼ in. [6.3 mm] the 
wall thicknesses of the pipe from which the test specimens are 
taken. If heat treatment is performed in continuous or batch­
type furnaces controlled within a 50 °F [30 °C] range and 
equipped with recording pyrometers so that complete records 
of heat treatment are available, then one test from each heat in 
a continuous run only shall be required instead of one test from 
each heat in each heat-treatment load. 
12.4 Impact Tests (Welded Pipe)-On welded pipe, addi­
tional impact tests of the same number as required in 12.3 shall 
be made to test the weld. 
12.5 Specimens showing defects while being machined or 
prior to testing may be discarded and replacements shall be 
considered as original specimens. 
12.6 Results obtained from these tests shall be reported to 
the purchaser or his representative. 
13. Specimens for Impact Test 
13.1 Notched bar impact specimens shall be of the simple 
beam, Charpy-type, in accordance with Test Methods 
Type A with a V notch. Standard specimens 10 by 10 mm in 
cross section shall be used unless the material to be tested is of 
insufficient thickness, in which case the largest obtainable 
subsize specimens shall be used. Charpy specimens of width 
along the notch larger than 0.394 in. [10 mm] or smaller than 
0.099 in. [2.5 mm] are not provided for in this specification. 
13.2 Test specimens shall be obtained so that the longitudi­
nal axis of the specimen is parallel to the longitudinal axis of 
the pipe while the axis of the notch shall be perpendicular to 
the smface. On wall thicknesses of 1 in. [25 mm] or less, the 
specimens shall be obtained with their axial plane located at the 
midpoint; on wall thicknesses over 1 in. [25 mm], the speci­
mens shall be obtained with their axial plane located ½ in. 
[12.5 mm] from the outer surface. 
13.3 When testing welds the specimen shall be, whenever 
diameter and thickness permit, transverse to the longitudinal 
axis of the pipe with the notch of the specimen in the welded 
joint and perpendicular to the surface. When diameter and 
thickness do not permit obtaining transverse specimens, longi­
tudinal specimens in accordance with 13.2 shall be obtained; 
the bottom of the notch shall be located at the weld joint. 
14. Impact Test 
14.1 Except when the size of the finished pipe is insufficient 
to permit obtaining subsize impact specimens, all material 
furnished to this specification and marked in accordance with 
Section 16 shall be tested for impact resistance at the minimum 
temperature for the respective grades as shown in Table 4. 
14.1.1 Special impact tests on individual lots of material 
may be made at other temperatures as agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
14.1.2 When subsize Charpy impact specimens are used and 
the width along the notch is less than 80 % of the actual wall 
thickness of the miginal material, the specified Charpy impact 
test temperature for Grades 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 shall be 
lower than the minimum temperature shown in Table 4 for the 
respective grade. Under these circumstances the temperature 
reduction values shall be by an amount equal to the difference 
(as shown in Table 6) between the temperature reduction 
corresponding to the actual material thickness and the tempera­
ture reduction corresponding to the Charpy specimen width
