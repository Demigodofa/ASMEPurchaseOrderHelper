8 End out-of-square is measured by (a) squaring from the center line of the web and (b) squaring from the center line of the flange. The measured variation from true 
squareness in either plane shall not exceed the total tabular amount. 
0 Length is measured along center line of web. Measurements are made with the steel and tape at the same temperature.
