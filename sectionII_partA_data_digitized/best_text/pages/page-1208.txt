SA-688/SA-688M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless and Welded Austenitic Stainless Steel Feedwater 
Heater Tubes 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers seamless and welded auste­
nitic stainless steel feedwater heater tubes including those bent, 
if specified, into the form of U-tubes for application in tubular 
feed-water heaters. 
1.2 The tubing sizes covered shall be 5/s to 1 in. [15.9 to 
25.4 mm] inclusive outside diameter, and average or minimum 
wall thicknesses of 0.028 in. [0.7 mm] and heavier. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard.
