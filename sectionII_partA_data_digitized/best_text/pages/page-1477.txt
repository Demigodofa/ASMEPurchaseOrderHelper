ABased upon the following equation (this equation should not be used for 
extrapolating values beyond the size ranges listed in this table) and rounded to 
nearest 3.5 MPa equivalent:

f Minimum proof stress of nut, MPa, 
As Tensile stress area of nut, mm 2 = 0.7854 [D - 0.9382P] 2 , and 
p Thread pitch, mm. 
15.2 Tension Tests, and, When Applicable, Impact Tests, 
Bar, Rod, or Wire or Components, or Both, Machined from 
Heat Treated Bar, Rod, or Wire-Batch processing: One test 
per lot as defined in 3.1.10.1. Continuous processing as defined 
in 3.1.10.2: Not fewer than two tension and, when applicable, 
impact tests are required for each lot containing 20 000 lb 
[9000 kg] or less. Every additional 10 000 lb [4500 kg] or 
fraction thereof requires one additional test. 
15.3 Tension Tests, Components Produced as Defined in 
8.6-The number of machined specimens or full size bolting 
components tested shall be as follows: 
Lot Size (pc) 
50 and less 
51 to 500 
501 to 35 000 
Over 35 000

15.4 Decarburization I Carburization Test, Carbon and 
Alloy Steel, Components Produced as Defined in 8.6 and Studs 
Machined from Cold or Hot Rolled and Heat Treated Bar 
Whose Diameter Prior to Machining Threads is Within 0.06 in. 
[1.5 mm] in Diameter of the Maximum Thread Diameter-One 
test per lot (see 3.1.10). 
15.5 Hardness Tests: 
15.5.1 Hardness Tests, Bar, Rod, or Wire-One test per lot. 
15.5.2 Hardness Tests, Components-The minimum num-
ber of bolting components that must be hardness tested per lot, 
regardless of the manufactudng production process, shall 
conform to 15.3. 
15.6 Macroetch, Carbon and Alloy Steels Only-One test 
per lot. A lot in this case is defined as a single diameter of a 
single heat or the largest diameter of a single heat. 
15.7 Impact Tests-Three impact test specimens shall be 
made for each lot when impact testing is required by the 
product specification. 
15.8 Other Tests-The number of tests shall be as specified 
by the purchaser or the individual product specification. 
16. Retests and Rework 
16.1 If the results of a mechanical test do not conform to 
specified requirements, the manufacturer may perform a 
double retest in compliance with the applicable governing test 
methods. If both retests pass, then the associated lot will be 
considered acceptable. In the case of impact testing, a single 
retest, consisting of three additional test specimens, may be 
performed. However, each individual impact value must be 
greater than the minimum specified average value. 
16.2 A lot may undergo a full reheat treatment no more than 
twice. After reheat treatment, all required mechanical tests 
shall be performed. 
16.3 Rework-Repair by welding is prohibited. 
17. Inspection 
17 .1 The supplier shall afford the purchaser or inspector 
representing the purchaser all reasonable facilities necessary to 
satisfy him that the matedal is being produced and furnished in 
accordance with this specification and the applicable product 
specification. Site inspection required by the purchaser shall 
not interfere unnecessadly with the supplier's operations. 
17 .2 Personnel performing the nondestructive examination 
shall be qualified and certified in accordance with a wdtten 
procedure conforming to ASNT Recommended Practice No.
