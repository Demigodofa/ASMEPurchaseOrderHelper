SA-265 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Nickel and Nickel-Base Alloy-Clad Steel Plate 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers plate of a carbon steel or 
low-alloy steel base to which is integrally and continuously 
bonded on one or both sides a layer of nickel or nickel-base 
alloy. The material is generally intended for pressure vessel use 
but may be used in other structural applications where corro­
sion resistance of the alloy is of prime importance. 
1.2 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as standard. The values given in parentheses are mathematical 
conversions to SI units that are provided for information only 
and are not considered standard.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Spec(fic to This Standard: 
3.1.l This material is considered as single-clad or double­
clad nickel or nickel-base alloy clad steel plate, depending on 
whether one or both sides are covered. 
3.1.2 The term plate as used in this specification applies to 
material 3/16 in. (2.73 mm) and over in thickness, and over 10 
in. (254 mm) in width.
