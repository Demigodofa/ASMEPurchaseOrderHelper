3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 lot-a lot shall consist of 200 ft [60 m] or fraction 
thereof of pipe from the same heat of steel. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 The inquiry and order for material under this specifica-
tion should include the following information: 
4.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
4.1.2 Name of material (steel pipe, electric-fusionwelded), 
4.1.3 Specification number, 
4.1.4 Grade and class designations (see 1.3), 
4 Available from American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), ASME 
International Headquarters, Two Park Ave., New York, NY 10016-5990, http:// 
www.asme.org. 
4.1.5 Size (inside or outside diameter, nominal or minimum 
wall thickness), 
4.1.6 Length (specific or random), 
4.1.7 End finish (11.4), 
4.1.8 Purchase options, if any (see 5.2.3 and 11.3 of this 
specification. See also Specification A530/A530M), 
4.1.9 Supplementary requirements, if any. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Materials-The steel plate material shall conform to the 
requirement of the applicable plate specification for the pipe 
grade ordered as listed in Table 1. 
5.2 Welding: 
5.2.1 The joints shall be double-welded, full-penetration 
welds made in accordance with procedures and by welders or 
welding operators qualified in accordance with the ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX. 
5.2.2 The welds shall be made either manually or automati­
cally by an electric process involving the deposition of filler 
metal. 
5.2.3 As welded, the welded joint shall have positive 
reinforcement at the center of each side of the weld, but no 
more than 1/s in. [3 mm]. This reinforcement may be removed 
at the manufacturer's option or by agreement between the 
manufacturer and purchaser. The contour of the reinforcement 
shall be smooth and the deposited metal shall be fused 
smoothly and uniformly into the plate surface. 
5.3 Heat Treatment-All classes other than 10, 11, 12, and 
13 shall be heat u:eated in furnace controlled to± 25 °F [± 15 
0 C] and equipped with a recording pyrometer so that heating 
records are available. Heat treating after forming and welding 
shall be to one of the following:
