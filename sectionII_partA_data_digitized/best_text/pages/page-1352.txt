12. Permissible Variations in Dimensions 
12.1 Variations in outside diameter, wall thickness, and 
length from those specified shall not exceed the amounts 
prescribed in Table 5. 
12.2 The permissible variations in outside diameter given in 
Table 5 are not sufficient to provide for ovality in thin-walled 
tubes, as defined in the table. In such tubes, the maximum and 
minimum diameters at any cross section shall deviate from the 
nominal diameter by no more than twice the permissible 
variation in outside diameter given in Table 5; however, the 
mean diameter at that cross section must still be within the 
given permissible variation. 
13. Surface Condition 
13.1 All tubes shall be free of excessive mill scale, suitable 
for inspection. A slight amount of oxidation will not be 
considered as scale. Any special finish requirements shall be 
subject to agreement between the manufacturer and the pur­
chaser. 
14. Product Marking 
14.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A1016/A1016M, the marking shall indicate whether the tubing 
is seamless or welded and the wall designation (average wall or 
minimum wall).
