ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-479/SA-479M 
A484M shall apply. Failure to comply with the general 
requirements of Specification A484/A484M constitutes non­
conformance with this specification. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Chemical composition shall be reported to the 
purchaser, or his representative, and shall conform to the 
requirements specified in Table 1. 
5 .2 When a product analysis is performed or requested by 
the purchaser, the tolerance limits as described in Specification 
A484/A484M apply unless Supplementary Requirement S3 is 
invoked. 
5.3 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with Test 
Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751. 
6. Grain Size for Austenitic Grades 
6.1 All austenitic grades shall be tested for average grain 
size by Test Methods Ell2. 
6.2 The H grades shall conform to an average grain size as 
follows: 
6.2.1 ASTM No. 6 or coarser for Types 304H, 309H, 310H, 
and 316H, and 
6.2.2 ASTM No. 7 or coarser for Types 321H, 347H, and 
348H. 
6.3 For S32615, the grain size as determined in accordance 
with Test Methods Ell2, comparison method, Plate 11, shall be 
No. 3 or finer. 
6.4 For N08810 and N08811, the average grain size as 
determined in accordance with Test Methods Ell2 shall be 
No. 5 or coarser. 
6.5 Supplementary Requirement Sl shall be invoked when 
non-H grade austenitic stainless steels are ordered for ASME 
Code applications for service above 1000 °F [540 °C]. 
7. Mechanical Properties Requirements 
7 .1 The material shall conform to the mechanical property 
requirements specified in Table 2 for the grade ordered. At least 
one room-temperature test shall be performed by the manufac­
turer on a sample from at least one bar or shape from each lot 
of material. 
7 .2 The yield strength shall be determined by the offset 
(0.2 % ) method as prescribed in Test Methods and Definitions 
A370. 
7 .3 Martensitic material supplied in the annealed condition 
shall be capable of meeting the hardened and tempered 
mechanical properties when heat treated. 
7.4 Hardness measurements, when required, shall be made 
at a location midway between the surface and the center of the 
cross section. 
7 .5 Martensitic grades shall be capable of meeting the 
hardness requirements after heat treating as specified in Table 
3. 
8. Testing for Intermetallic Compounds 
8.1 When specified by the purchaser in the purchase order, 
the manufacturer shall test the austenitic or austenitic-ferritic 
(duplex) stainless steel material in its final condition in 
accordance with supplementary test requirements S6. 
NoTB 2-Many, if not all, duplex stainless steels and some austenitic 
stainless steels will form intermetallic phases or compounds such as 
sigma, chi, and laves phases when exposed to temperatures below the 
specified annealing temperature or cooled slowly from a higher tempera­
ture during casting, welding, or annealing. These phases can have a 
negative effect on mechanical properties and co1Tosion resistance. These 
phases can typically be removed by correct annealing and cooling 
practices. The presence of these phases can be demonstrated by tests, 
typically involving metallography, impact toughness, or corrosion 
resistance, although the testing requirements may be different for different 
alloy grades. Such testing may or may not be routinely performed by the 
manufacturer. 
9. Certification 
9.1 The material manufacturer's certificate of compliance 
certifying that the material was manufactured and tested in 
accordance with this specification, together with a report of the 
results required by this specification and the purchase order, 
shall be furnished at the time of shipment. The certification 
shall be positively relatable to the lot of material represented. 
10. Product Marking 
10.1 In addition· to the marking requirements of Specifica­
tion A484/A484M, materials that have been heat treated or 
have been strain hardened shall be identified by placement of 
the following symbols after the grade designation: 
10.1.1 Austenitic Grades: 
10.1.1.1 All grades in the annealed condition-A, 
10.1.1.2 Strain hardened Type 316, Level 1--Sl,

10.1.1.4 Hot-rolled Type XM-19-H, 
10.1.1.5 Strain hardened Type XM-19-S, and 
10.1.1.6 Material meeting Supplementary Requirement 
Sl-ELT (unnecessary for H grades). 
10.1.1.7 In addition to all other marking requirements of 
this specification, when S 1 is invoked, all grades in the direct 
quenched condition shall be marked "D." 
10.1.2 Austenitic-Ferritic Grades-All grades in the an­
nealed condition-A. 
10.1.3 Ferritic Grades-All grades in the annealed 
condition-A.
