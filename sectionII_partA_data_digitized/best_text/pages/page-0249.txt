4.2 Tubes shall be made by electric-resistance welding. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 After welding, all tubes shall be heat treated at a 
temperature of 1650°F [900°C] or higher and followed by 
cooling in air or in the cooling chamber of a controlled­
atmosphere furnace. Cold-drawn tubes shall be heat treated 
after the final cold-draw pass at a temperature of 1200°F 
[650°C] or higher. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
6.2 When a grade is ordered under this specification, sup­
plying an alloy grade that specifically requires the addition of 
any element other than those listed in Table 1 is not permitted. 
7. Product Analysis 
7.1 When requested on the purchase order, a product analy­
sis shall be made by the manufacturer or supplier from one tube 
per 100 pieces for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm] and one tube per 
250 pieces for sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under; or when tubes 
are identified by heat, one tube per heat shall be analyzed. The 
chemical composition thus determined shall conform to the 
requirements specified. 
7 .2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be 
made. Both retests, for the elements in question, shall meet the 
requirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot (Note 2) shall be rejected or, at the 
option of the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or tube 
may be individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat-
rolled stock or tubes which do not meet the requirements of the 
specifications shall be rejected. 
NOTE 2-A lot consists of 250 tubes for sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under 
and of 100 tubes for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm], prior to cutting to length. 
8. General Requirements 
8.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A450/A450M unless otherwise provided herein. 
9. Tensile Requirements 
9.1 Grade C and D tubes shall conform to the requirements 
as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. 
Nom 3-Explanatory Note-For purposes of design the following 
tensile properties may be assumed for Grade A tubes: 
Tensile strength, min, ksi [MPa] 47 [325] 
Yield Strength, min, ksl [MPa] 26 [180] 
Elongation In 2 in. or 50 mm, min, % 35 
9.2 Table 3 gives the computed minimum elongation values 
for each 1/32-in. [0.8 mm] decrease in wall thickness. Where the 
wall thickness lies between two values shown above, the 
minimum elongation value shall be determined by the follow­
ing equation: 
E = 48t+ 15.00[E = l.87t+ 15.00] 
where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm,%, and, 
= actual thickness of specimen, in. [mm]. 
10. Crush Test 
10.1 When required by the purchaser, crushing tests shall be 
made on sections of tube 2½ in. [63 mm] in length which shall 
stand crushing longitudinally without cracking, splitting, or 
opening at the weld, as follows: 
Wall Thickness of 
Tubes, In. [mm] 
Height of Crushed Section, in. [mm] 
Grade A Tubes Grade C and D Tubes 
0.135 [3.43] and under % [19] or until outside Crush tests not required 
folds are in contact 
Over 0.135 [3.43] 1 ¼ [32] 
10.2 For tubing less than 1 in. [25.4 mm] in outside 
diameter, the length of the specimen shall be 2½ times the 
outside diameter of the tube. Slight surface checks shall not be 
cause for rejection.
