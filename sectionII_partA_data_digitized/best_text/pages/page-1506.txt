Xl. ALLOY DESIGNATIONS FOR CAST 
STAINLESS STEELS 
Xl.1 Cast stainless steels usually are specified on the 
basis of composition using the alloys designation system 
established by the Alloy Casting Institute (ACI). The ACI 
designations, for example, CF8M, have been adopted by 
ASTM and are preferred for cast alloys over the designa­
tions used by the American Iron and Steel Institute for 
similar wrought steels. 
Xl.2 This nomenclature system has served successfully 
to accommodate changes in old alloys and to designate 
new ones.

Xl.2.1 Service Classification Letter - The first letter 
of the cast stainless steel designation system identifies the 
intended service application of the alloy. The letter Cindi­
cates corrosion-resistant service, and the letter H indicates 
the heat-resistant service at and above 1200°F [650°C]. 
Xl.2.2 Ternary Diagram Location Letter- The second 
letter indicates the approximate location of the nickel and 
chromium contents of the alloy grade on the FeCrNi ternary 
diagram shown in Fig. Xl. 1. 
Xl.2.3 Carbon Content Number- For C service classi­
fications, this single or dual digit numeral represents the 
maximum carbon content in units of 0.01 %. For H service 
classifications, this number represents the midpoint of the 
range of carbon content in terms of 0.01 % with a 
±0.05% limit. 
Xl.2.4 Special Elements Letters - Additional letters 
following the numeral represents special chemical elements 
in the alloy grade, such as M for molybdenum, C for 
columbium, Cu for copper, and W for tungsten. There are 
two exceptions. The letter A indicates "Controlled Ferrite," 
and the letter F indicates "Free Machining." 
Xl.3 In Fig. Xl.l, unlettered NiCr ranges are associ­
ated with the nearest lettered location. They may be the 
result of differences between corrosion and heat-resistance 
types or because of the influence of additional elements, 
for example, the precipitation hardening grade CB- 7 Cu.
