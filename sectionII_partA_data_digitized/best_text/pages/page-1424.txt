S78. Low Sulfur Treatment 
S78.1 Restricted sulfur content shall be specified on the 
order. In the absence of such a specification the maximum 
sulfur furnished under this supplementary requirement shall be 
0.003 % on heat analysis. 
NoTE S78.l-The low sulfur treatment is for the purpose of enhancing 
the HIC (Hydrogen Induced Cracking) and SSC (Sulfide Stress Cracking) 
resistance. 
S79. Carbon Equivalent Limit 
S79.1 The carbon equivalent, on heat analysis, shall not 
exceed 0.27 %, or a lower value as specified in the purchase 
order, when based on the following equation: 
Si Mn+Cu+Cr Ni Mo V 
PCM= c+ 30+ 20 + 60+1s+ 10+ 5 B%

Xl. THERMO-MECHANICAL CONTROLLED PROCESSING (TMCP) 
Xl.1 Introduction-The Thermo•Mechanical Controlled 
Processing, commonly referred . to as "TMCP," has evolved 
from the "controlled rolling" (CR) processes, which have been 
known and used for a number of years. TMCP produces 
fine-grained steel by a combination of chemical composition 
and integrated controls of manufacturing processes from slab 
reheating to post-rolling cooling, thereby achieving the speci­
fied mechanical properties in the required plate thicknesses. 
TMCP requires accurate control of both the steel temperature 
and rolling reductions, and does not involve coiling after the 
post- cooling. 
Xl.2 Outline of TMCP As May Be applied to Grades A 
through F-As shown in Fig. Xl.l, TMCP for those grades 
may incorporate three processes, as follows: 
Xl.2.1 Thermo-Mechanical Rolling (TMR)-Steels of fine 
grain size are produced by rolling in the recrystallization and 
the nonrecrystallization regions of austenite, and sometimes in 
the dual-phase temperature region of austenite and ferrite. 
Generally, a high proportion of the rolling reduction is per•

formed close to, or below, the temperature at which austenite 
begins to transform to ferrite during cooling (Ar3) and may 
involve rolling in the lower portion of the temperature range of 
the intercritical dual-phase region. 
Xl.2.2 Accelerated Cooling (AC)-Steels meeting the 
specified requirements are produced by controlled cooling 
(accelerated cooling and air cooling) through the dual-phase 
teq1perature region immediately after final controlled rolling 
(CR) or TMR operation, 
Xl.2.3 Direct Quenched and Tempered (DQT)-:-Steels 
meeting the specified requirements are produced by promoting 
grain refinement and increasing hardness through direct 
quenching i:tnmediately after final controlled rolling (CR) or 
TMR operations. Subsequent to direct quenching the plates are 
tempered. 
Xl.2.4 The selection, from the above, of the method to be 
used is made by the plate producer depending upon the 
chemical composition, the plate thickness, and the required 
properties.
