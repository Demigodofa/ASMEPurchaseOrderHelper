A In the above tabulation, Grades 42, 50, and 60 [290, 345, and 415], are the yield point levels most closely approximating a geometric progression pattern between 36 
ksi [250 MPa], min, yield point steels covered by Specification A36/A36M and 100 ksi [690 MPa], min, yield strength steels covered by Specification A514/A514M. 
8 Round bars up to and including 11 in. [275 mm] in diameter are permitted. 
c Round bars up to and including 3½ in. [90 mm] in diameter are permitted.

A Copper when specified shall have a minimum content of 0.20 % by heat analysis (0.18 % by product analysis). 
8 Manganese, minimum, by heat analysis of 0.80 % (0.75 % by product analysis) shall be required for all plates over% in. [10 mm] in thickness; a minimum of 0.50 % 
(0.45 % by product analysis) shall be required for plates % in. [1 O mm] and less in thickness, and for all other products. The manganese to carbon ratio shall not be less 
than 2 to 1. 
c Bars over 1 ½ in. [40 mm] in diameter, thickness, or distance between parallel faces shall be made by a killed steel practice. 
° For each reduction of 0.01 percentage point below the specified carbon maximum, an increase of 0.06 percentage point manganese above the specified maximum is 
permitted, up to a maximum of 1.60 %. 
E Round bars up to and including 11 in. [275 mm] in diameter are permitted. 
F Round bars up to and including 3½ in. [90 mm] in diameter are permitted. 
a The size and grade is not described in this specification. 
H An alternative chemical requirement with a maximum carbon of 0.21 % and a maximum manganese of 1.65 % is permitted, with the balance of the elements as shown 
in Table 2. 
'A maximum phosphorus content of 0.04 % and a maximum sulfur content of 0.05 % are permitted for the following materials: 
• Structural shapes 
• Sheet piling 
• Bars 
, Plates with widths up to and including 15 in. [380 mm] 
3. General Requirements for Delivery 
3.1 Structural products furnished under this specification 
shall conform to the requirements of the cmrent edition of 
Specification A6/ A6M, for the specific structural product 
ordered, unless a conflict exists in which case this specification 
shall prevail. 
3.2 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into a finished structural product. 
Structural products produced from coil means structural prod­
ucts that have been cut to individual lengths from a coil. The 
processor directly controls, or is responsible for, the operations 
involved in the processing of a coil into a finished structural 
product. Such operations include decoiling, leveling or 
straightening, hot-forming or cold-forming (if applicable), 
cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, heat treat­
ment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for shipment, 
and certification. 
NoTE 1-For structural products produced from coil and furnished 
without heat treatment or with stress relieving only, two test results are to 
be reported for each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding 
structural products produced from coil are described in Specification 
A6/A6M. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel shall be killed.
