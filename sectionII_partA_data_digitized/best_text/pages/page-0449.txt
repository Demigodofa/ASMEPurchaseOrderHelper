ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-266/SA-266M 
S4. Magnetic Particle Examination 
S4.1 All accessible surfaces of the finished forging shall be 
examined by a magnetic particle method. The method shall be 
in accordance with Practice A275/A275M. Acceptance limits 
shall be as agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
SS. Liquid Penetrant Examination 
S5.1 After forgings have been heat-treated by liquid 
quenching and tempering, all accessible surfaces shall be 
inspected for quench cracks by the liquid penetrant method in 
accordance with Test Method E165/El65M as an alternative to 
magnetic particle exanrination. 
S6. Macroetch Test 
S6.1 A sample forging shall be sectioned and etched to 
show ·flow lines and internal imperfections. The test shall be 
conducted in accordance with Method E381. Details of the test 
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
S7. Product Analysis 
S7 .1 A product analysis in accordance with Section 7 shall 
be made from one randomly selected forging representing each 
size and shape of forging on the order. If the analysis fails to 
comply, each forging shall be checked or the lot rejected. All 
results shall be reported to the purchaser. 
SS. Specimen Location on Forged Hubs 
S8.1 Forged hubs to be butt-welded to shells shall be forged 
in such a manner as to provide in the hub the full nrinimum 
tensile strength and elongation specified for the material, in a 
direction parallel to the axis of the vessel. A tension specimen 
(subsize if necessary) shall be taken in this direction and as 
close to the finished hub outside diameter as practical. 
S9. Hardness 
S9.1 The purchaser may check the Brinell hardness of the 
forging at any location on the surface of the forging, and the 
hardness shall be within the following limits: 
Grade 
1 
2 and 4 
3 
SlO. Grain Size 
Brinell Hardness Range HBW 
121 to 170 
137 to 197 
156 to 207 
S 10 .1 The austenitic grain size of the steel shall be 1 to 5 as 
determined using Test Methods E112. 
Sll. Restriction on Residual Elements (Applicable to Heat 
Analysis) 
S 11.1 Nickel, chromium, and molybdenum shall be deter­
mined and shall not exceed the following limits: 
Nickel 
Chromium 
Molybdenum 
S12. Deleted. 
S13. Impact Tests 
0.25 % max 
0.20 % max 
0,08% max 
S13.l Charpy impact tests shall be made. The number and 
location of the tests, minimum properties, and test temperatures 
shall be specified. 
397 
Sl3.2 The specimens shall be machined and tested in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
Sl3.3 Retests may be conducted in accordance with Section 
10 of Specification A 788/ A 788M. 
S14. Individual Forging 
Sl4.1 Forgings, whether identical or not, shall be produced 
individually. They shall not be forged in multiples and sepa­
rated prior to or after heat treatment. 
Sl4.2 The shape and size of individual forgings shall be 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser by 
means of a forging drawing or the purchase order. 
SIS. Carbon Equivalancy 
Sl5.1 The heat analysis including the residual element 
restrictions of Sl in Specification A788/A788M shall be 
limited such that the carbon equivalent shall not exceed 0.45 
for Grade 1 or 0.50 for Grade 2 or 4 when calculated in 
accordance with the following formula: 
%Mn %Cr+%Mo+%V %Ni+%Cu 
CE=% C+-6-+ 5 + 15
