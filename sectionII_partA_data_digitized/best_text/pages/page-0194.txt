6.2 If the analysis of either pipe does not conform to the 
requirements given in Table 1, analyses shall be made on 
additional pipes of double the original number from the same 
lot, each of which shall conform to the specified requirements. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Tension Test: 
7 .1.1 For tension tests other than transverse weld tension 
tests, the yield strength corresponding to a permanent offset of 
0.2 % of the gage length or to an extension of 0.5 % of the gage 
length under load, the tensile strength, and the elongation in 2 
in. or 50 mm shall be determined, and the tension test results 
shall conform to the applicable tensile property requirements 
given in Table 2. 
7.1.2 For transverse weld tension tests, the tensile strength 
shall be determined, and the tension test results shall conform 
to the applicable tensile strength requirement given in Table 2. 
7.1.3 Electric-resistance-welded pipe NPS 8 [DN 200] or 
larger shall be tested using two transverse test specimens, one 
taken across the weld and one taken opposite the weld. 
7 .1.4 Transverse tension test specimens shall be approxi­
mately 1 V2 in. [38 mm] wide in the gage length and shall 
represent the full wall thickness of the pipe from which the test 
specimens were cut.

Elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm A,a A,a 
A The minimum elongation in 2 in. [50 mm] shall be that determined by the 
following equation: 
e = 625000 [ 1940 J A°• 2 1 u 0 ·• 
where: 
e minimum elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm in percent, rounded to the nearest 
percent, 
A the lesser of. 0.75 in. 2 [500 mm 2 ] and the cross-sectional area of the 
tension test specimen, calculated using the specified outside diameter of 
the pipe, or the nominal width of the tension test specimen and the 
specified wall thickness of the pipe, with the calculated value 
rounded to the nearest 0.01 in. 2 [1 mm 2 ], and 
U = specified minimum tensile strength, psi [MPa]. 
8 See Table X4.1 or Table X4.2, whichever is applicable, for the minimum 
elongation values that are required for various combinations of tension test 
specimen size and specified minimum tensile strength. 
7 .2 Bend Test: 
7.2.1 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] or smaller, a sufficient length 
of pipe shall be capable of being bent cold through 90° around 
a cylindrical mandrel, the diameter of which is twelve times the 
specified outside diameter of the pipe, without developing 
cracks at any portion and without opening the weld. 
7.2.2 If ordered for close coiling, the pipe shall stand being 
bent cold through 180° around a cylindrical mandrel, the 
diameter of which is eight times the specified outside diameter 
of the pipe, without failure. 
7.2.3 Double-extra-strong pipe over NPS 1 V4 [DN 32] need 
not be subjected to the bend test. 
7 .3 Flattening Test: 
7.3.1 The flattening test shall be made on welded pipe over 
NPS 2 [DN 50] in extra-strong weight or lighter. 
7.3.2 Seamless Pipe: 
7.3.2.1 Although testing is not required, pipe shall be 
capable of meeting the flattening test requirements of Supple­
mentary Requirement S 1, if tested. 
7.3.3 Electric-Resistance-Welded Pipe: 
7.3.3.1 A test specimen at least 4 in. [100 mm] in length 
shall be flattened cold between parallel plates in three steps, 
with the weld located either 0° or 90° from the line of direction 
of force as required by 7.3.3.2 or 7.3.3.3, whichever is 
applicable. During the first step, which is a test for ductility of 
the weld, except as allowed by 7.3.5, 7.3.6, and 7.3.7, no cracks 
or breaks on the inside or outside surface at the weld shall be 
present before the distance between the plates is less than two 
thirds of the specified outside diameter of the pipe. As a second 
step, the flattening shall be continued as a test for ductility 
away from the weld. During the second step, except as allowed 
by 7.3.6 and 7.3.7, no cracks or breaks on the inside or outside 
surface away from the weld shall be present before the distance 
between the plates is less than one third of the specified outside 
diameter of the pipe but is not less than five times the specified 
wall thickness of the pipe. During the third step, which is a test 
for soundness, the flattening shall be continued until the test 
specimen breaks or the opposite walls of the test specimen 
meet. Evidence of laminated or unsound material or of incom­
plete weld that is revealed by the flattening test shall be cause 
for rejection.

7.3.3.2 For pipe produced in single lengths, the flattening 
test specified in 7.3.3.1 shall be made using a test specimen
