4.1.2.8 
(1) • This refers to the edition of the source standard currently adopted by BPV II. The source standards for ASME material specifications 
listed in this table are ASTM standards. 
(2) This refers to differences between the ASME material specification and the source standard. 
(3) This refers to acceptable editions of the corresponding ASTM specification. Ellipses in this column indicate that there are not any other 
acceptable editions. 
( 4) ASTM technical committees review the standards under their jurisdiction on a 5-yr cycle. If no changes are needed, then the standard is 
simply reapproved. At times, editorial errors are discovered within an ASTM standard between the 5-yr review cycle. If the technical 
committee decides to fix the errors immediately, then the standard will be republished with a superscript epsilon ( E) in the designation. 
BPVC II Committee has taken the position that a reapproved or editorially corrected edition is technically and substantively identical to 
the base edition. For example, edition 15(2020), 15•1, or 15(2020}"1 is technically and substantively identical to 15. Therefore, for the 
purposes of ASME construction, a reapproved or editorially corrected edition of an ASTM specification shall be considered acceptable for 
use, even if the edition is beyond the range listed in this column, provided that its base edition is within range.
