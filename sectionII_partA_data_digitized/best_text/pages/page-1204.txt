SA-675/SA-675M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR STEEL BARS, CARBON, 
HOT-WROUGHT, SPECIAL QUALITY, 
MECHANICAL PROPERTIES 
SA-675/SA-675M 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 675/ A 675M-03(2009) except that Supplementary Requirement S7 has Grades 65 and 70 added, and S7 is 
mandatory. Sections 4.1.9 and 10 revised to make certification mandatory.] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers hot-wrought special qual­
ity carbon steel bars and bar size shapes produced to 
mechanical property requirements and intended for general 
constructional applications. 
1.2 The bars are available in nine strength grades desig­
nated 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 90 [310, 345, 
380, 415, 450, 485, 515, 550, and 620] corresponding to 
the minimum ultimate tensile strength in ksi [MPa]. The 
chemical composition is selected by the manufacturer to 
develop the required mechanical properties. 
1.3 Hot-wrought special quality carbon steel bars sub­
ject to mechanical property requirements are hot wrought 
in straight lengths only. Sections and sizes available are 
covered in Specification A 29 / A 29M. 
1.4 Some applications may require one or more of the 
available designations shown under Supplementary 
Requirements. 
NOTE 1 - Merchant-quality hot-wrought carbon steel bars subject to 
mechanical property requirements are covered in Specification 
A663/A663M. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as the standard. Within 
the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values 
stated in each system are not equivalents, therefore each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconfonnance 
with the specification.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 special quality - Special quality bars are used 
when end use, method of fabrication, or subsequent pro­
cessing treatment requires quality characteristics not avail­
able in merchant quality. Typical applications involve 
bending or machining for general constructional uses. 
Some end uses or fabricating procedures can necessitate 
one or more requirements which are described in the Sup­
plementary Requirements.
