additional ordering information, manufacturing require­
ments, testing and retesting methods and procedures, mark­
ing, certification, product analysis variations, and 
additional supplementary requirements. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in con­
flict with the requirements of Specification A 788, the 
requirements of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Chemical Composition 
4.1 Heat Analysis - The heat analysis obtained from 
sampling in accordance with Specification A 788 shall 
comply with Table 1 except that the additional features of 
Supplementary Requirements S8, S9, SlO, S12, and S15 
shall also apply as individually specified in the ordering 
information. 
4.2 Product Analysis - The manufacturer shall use the 
product analysis provision of Specification A 788 to obtain 
a product analysis from a forging representing each heat 
or multiple heat. The permissible variations of Table 1 of 
Specification A 788 do not apply to carbon, phosphorus, 
silicon, and sulphur for all classes, vanadium for Grade 
1 C, and columbium and calcium for Grades 22V and 3VCb. 
Boron is not subject. to product analysis. The purchaser 
may also make this determination in accordance with Spec­
ification A 788. 
5. Heat Treatment for Mechanical Properties 
shall be tempered at a subcritical temperature as described 
in 5.1. 
6. Mechanical Properties 
6.1 General Requirements - The forgings shall con­
form to the requirements of Table 2. The forgings shall 
also conform to the requirements of Table 3 unless either 
Supplementary Requirement S6 or S 13 is specified, in 
which case the requirements of those sections shall apply. 
The largest obtainable tension test specimen as specified 
in Fig. 4 of Test Methods and Definitions A 370 shall be 
used. Impact specimens shall be Charpy V-notch, as shown 
in Fig. 10 of Test Methods and Definitions A 370. The 
usage of subsize impact specimens due to material limita­
tions must have prior purchaser approval. 
6.2 Sampling - The longitudinal axis and mid-length 
of tension and impact test specimens shall be positioned 
in accordance with one of the following methods as speci­
fied by the purchaser: 
6.2.1 Method 1 - This method shall always be used 
when the maximum quenched thickness does not exceed 
2 in. [50 mm]. Specimens shall be located in the production 
forging or test forging ( as described in Method 4) at mid­
thickness and at least 2 in. from other quenched surfaces. 
6.2.2 Method 2 - t by 2t, where t is the distance 
from the area of significant loading (see 3.1) to the nearest 
quenched surface. However, the specimens shall not be 
nearer to one quenched surface than ¾ in. [20 mm] and to 
the second quenched surface than 1½ in. [40 mm]. When 
5.1 After complete austenitization, the forgings shall this method of testing is employed, forgings are usually 
be quenched in a suitable liquid medium by spraying or manufactured in accordance with a purchaser-approved 
immersion. For Grade 22V forgings, the minimum austeni- drawing showing pre-quenched dimensions and the loca-
tizing temperature shall be 1650°F [900°C]. Quenching tion of mechanical test specimens. 
shall be followed by tempering at a subcritical temperature 
and holding at this temperature for a minimum time of . 6.2.3 Method 3_ - ¼ T by T, where Tis the 1:1aximum

5.2 For Classes 1, IA, 2, 2A, 3, or 3A, a multiple stage

by reheating within the intercritical temperature range to
