SA-874/SA-874M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Ferritic Ductile Iron Castings Suitable for Low-Temperature 
Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers ductile iron castings suitable 
for service at temperatures of -40°F [-40°C] and above. 
1.2 The values stated in either inch-pound or SI units are to 
be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the SI units 
are shown in brackets. The values stated in each system are not 
exact equivalents; therefore, each system shall be used inde­
pendently of the other. Combining values from the two systems 
may result in nonconfonnance with the specification. 
1.3 The following precautionary statement pertains only to 
the test methods portion, Section 11, of this specification: This 
standard does not pwport to address all of the safety concerns, 
(f' any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user 
of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limita­
tions prior to use.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for material under this specification shall include 
the following applicable information: 
3.1.1 Drawing, catalog number, or part identification, 
3.1.2 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), 
3.1.3 ASTM designation and year of issue, 
3.1.4 Marking instructions (see Section 15), 
3.1.5 Place of inspection (see 13.1), 
3.1.6 Limits on residual elements (see 5.2), 
3.1.7 Visual and dimensional acceptance standard (see 7.1), 
3.1.8 Sampling plan (see Section 9), and 
3.1.9 Supplementary requirements. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Castings may be supplied either as cast or heat treated 
and shall have essentially a ferritic structure that contains no 
massive carbides. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5 .1 The iron shall conform to the requirements for chemical 
composition shown in Table 1. 
5.2 By agreement between the manufacturer and purchaser, 
analysis may be required and limits established for elements 
not specified in Table 1. 
6. Mechanical and Microstructural Properties 
6.1 Tensile Properties-The iron shall conform to the re­
quirements for tensile properties shown in Table 2. 
6.2 Microstructure-Graphite contained in the microstruc­
ture shall be evaluated in accordance with Test Method A 24 7. 
The percent of each graphite type shall be estimated, and the 
total of an estimates shall equal 100 %. The total percent of 
Types I and 2 graphite shall be a minimum of 90 %. 
7. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
7 .1 The surface of the casting shall be examined visually 
and shall be free from adhering sand, scale, cracks, and hot 
tears. Other surface discontinuities shall meet visual and 
dimensional acceptance standards specified in the order.
