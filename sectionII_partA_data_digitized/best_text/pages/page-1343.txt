FIG. S12.1 Tension Test Specimens 
S14.l.2 Fracture appearance (see Supplement 5 of Test 
Methods and Definitions A370), or 
S14.l.3 Lateral expansion. 
S14.l.4 The test temperature range shall be wide enough to 
establish the upper and lower shelf energies, with sufficient 
testing at intermediate temperatures to permit a smooth curve 
to be plotted. A minimum test temperature may be set by 
agreement instead of establishing the lower shelf temperature. 
The upper shelf energy level is defined as having at least 95 % 
fibrous fracture and the lower shelf level is defined as showing 
5 % or less fibrous fracture. 
S142 The purchaser shall furnish the manufacturer with 
details of sample location, number of specimens, heat 
treatments, and information to be derived from the test. 
S15. Grain Size 
S15.1 When a grain size range is requ;ired, it shall be 
specified in the ordering information as heat treated or 
austenitic, and shall be determined by an agreed-upon method 
from Test Methods E112. 
Sl5.2 Samples for grain size estimation from heat treated 
products shall be taken from the tension test specimen location. 
S16. Rough Machining and Boring 
S 16.1 The position of the rough machining and boring in the 
manufacturing sequence shall be specified by the purchaser, 
particularly with regard to heat treatment for mechanical 
properties. 
S17. Simulated Post-Weld Heat Treatment of Mechanical 
Test Samples 
S 17 .1 All test coupons shall be subjected to single or 
multiple heat treatments at subcritical temperatures prior to 
testing. Such treatments are intended to simulate post-weld or 
other treatments to which the forgings will be subjected during 
subsequent fabrication. The purchaser shall furnish the manu­
facturer with details of the desired heat treatment for the test 
coupons, including temperatures, times, and cooling rates. 
SIS. Magnetic Particle Examination 
S 18.1 All accessible surfaces of the finished forging shall be 
subject to magnetic particle examination in accordance with 
Practice A275/A275M. 
Sl8.2 Unless otherwise agreed upon between the manufac­
turer and the purchaser the wet continuous method shall be 
used. 
S18.2.1 The following conditions are subject to rejection or 
removal: 
S18.2.1.1 Indications with major dimension exceeding 3/16 
in. [5 mm]. 
S 18.2.1.2 Four or more indications exceeding 1/16 in.· 
[1.5 mm] in major dimensions that are aligned and separated 
by 1/16 in. [1.5 mm] or less end to end. 
Sl8.2.l.3 Ten or more indications exceeding 1/16 in. 
[1.5 mm] in major dimensions contained in arty 6 in.2 [40 cm 2 ] 
of surface, with the major dimension of this area not to exceed. 
6 in. [150 mm]. The area shall be taken in the most unfavorable 
location relative to the indications being evaluated. 
S19. Liquid Penetrant Examination 
S 19 .1 All accessible surfaces of the finished forging shall be 
subject to liquid penetrant examination in accordance with 
Practice El65/El65M. The penetrant system to be used shall 
be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
S19.2 The following conditions are subject to rejection or 
removal: 
S19.2.1 Indications with major dimensions exceeding 1/16 .• 
in. [5 mm].
