5.2 Heat Analysis-Each heat of steel shall be analyzed to 
determine the percentage of elements prescribed in Table 1. 
This analysis shall be made from a test specimen preferably 
taken during the pouring of the heat. When requested, this shall 
be reported to the purchaser and shall conform to the require­
ments of Table 1. 
5.3 Product Analysis-An analysis may be made by the 
purchaser from finished wire representing each heat of steel. 
The chemical composition thus determined, as to elements 
required or restricted, shall conform to the product analysis 
requirements specified in Table 10 of Specification A510/ 
A510M. 
5.4 For referee purposes, Test Methods, Practices, and 
Terminology A751 shall be used. 
6. Mechanical Requirements 
6.1 Tension Test. 
6.1.1 Requirements-The material as represented by tension 
test specimens shall conform to the requirements prescribed in 
Table 2. 
6.1.2 Number of Tests-One test specimen shall be taken 
from each end of every coil. 
6.1.3 Test Method-The tension test shall be made in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370, except 
that the length L for evaluation of the elongation shall be 
calculated from the following formula: 
L = 11.3-y'w.r 
where 
W = width of the wire, and 
T = thickness of the wire. 
The length L shall be used to calculate the permanent 
elongation. The distance between the gage marks shall be 
measured to the nearest 0.004 in. (0.1 mm). Determine tensile 
properties and permanent elongation as described in Test 
Methods and Definitions A370. 
6.1.4 Retest-If any test specimen exhibits obvious 
discontinuity, it may be discarded and another specimen 
substituted. 
7. Dimensions and Permissible Variations 
7 .1 The permissible variations in dimensions of the wire 
shall be as specified in Table 3, unless otherwise specified in 
the ordering information. 
8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
8.1 The wire shall be free of detrimental surface 
imperfections, tangles and sharp kinks. 
8.2 The wire shall conform to the dimensions, tolerances, 
and finish specified on the order or drawing. Welds are not 
permitted. 
8.3 When required, non-destructive examination shall be 
carried out in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S 1. 
8.4 The wire as received shall be smooth and substantially 
free from rust. No detrimental die marks or scratches may be 
present. 
9. Inspection 
9.1 The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's inspector 
all reasonable facilities to satisfy him that the material is being 
produced and furnished in accordance with this specification. 
All tests and inspections may be made at the place of 
manufacture prior to shipment and shall be so conducted as to 
not interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the work. 
10. Certification and Reports 
10.1 The manufacturer shall furnish the required number, 
from the purchase order, of test reports to the purchaser. The 
following items shall be reported. 
10.l.1 Heat number, 
10.1.2 Heat chemical analysis, 
10.1.3 Result of test of tensile properties, 
10.1.4 Reports of non-destructive tests, if required (S.l), 
and 
10.1.5 ASTM specification number, year of issue and revi­
sion letter, if any.
