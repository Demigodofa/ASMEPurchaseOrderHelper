the basis of heat treated specimens per para. 6.5.1 shall be 
marked with letter "G" following the marked specification 
designation. 
1.2 Dimensions: 
1.2.1 Product thickness or diameter as applicable, 
shall not be greater than the dimension shown in the

2H, 28, 2G, or 2P, shall be equal to or greater than 5 mm. 
1.2.3 Thickness or diameter of bright bars of Grade 
X2CrNiMoCuN25-6-3 delivered in conditions 2H, 28, 2G, 
or 2P, shall be greater than 16 mm. 
1.3 Tests and Inspection: 
1.3.1 Reports: 
1.3.1.1 A Material Test Report shall be provided 
and, if required by the referencing Code Section or 
Purchase Order, a Certificate of Conformance shall be 
supplied in addition to any test reports or inspection certi-
ficates described in para. 7.2. Certified Material Test 
Reports shall be provided when applicable.
