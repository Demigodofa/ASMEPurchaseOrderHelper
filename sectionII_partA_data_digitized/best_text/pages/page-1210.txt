SA·688/SA-688M . ASME BPVC.II.A·2025 
6.2 Seamless Tubing: 
6.2.1 Seamless tubing shall be supplied from a cold finish­
ing process. Hot finishing as the final sizing process is not 
allowed. 
6.3 Welded Tubing: 
6.3.1 The tube shall be made from flat-rolled steel by an 
automatic welding process with no addition of filler metal. 
6.3.2 Subsequent to welding and prior to final heat 
treatment, the tubes shall be cold worked either in both the 
weld and base metal, or in the weld metal only. The method of 
cold work may be specified by the purchaser. When cold 
drawn, the purchaser may specify the minimum amount of 
reduction in cross-sectional area or wall thickness, or both. 
6.4 Many surface contaminants may have detrimental ef­
fects on high temperature properties or corrosion resistance of 
tubing. Contamination by copper, lead, mercury, zinc, 
chlorides, or sulfur may be detrimental to stainless steels. The 
manufacturer shall employ techniques that minimize surface 
contamination by these elements. 
7. Cleaning Before Annealing 
7 .1 All lubricants of coatings used in the manufacture of 
straight-length tube or in the bending shall be removed from all 
surfaces prior to any annealing treatments. U-bends on which 
a lubricant had been applied to the inside surface during 
bending shall have the cleanness of their inside surface 
confirmed by blowing close fitting acetone-soaked felt plugs 
through 10 % of the tubes of each bend radius. Dry, oil-free, air 
or inert gas shall be used to blow the plugs through the tubes. 
If the plugs blown through any tube shows more than a light 
gray discoloration, all tubes that have had a lubricant applied to 
the inside surface during bending shall be recleaned. After 
recleaning 10 % of the tubes of each bend radius whose inside 
surface had been subjected to bending lubricants shall be 
retested. 
8. Heat Treatment 
8.1 All finished straight tubing or straight tubing ready for 
U-bending shall be furnished in the solution-annealed condi­
tion. The annealing procedure, except for N08367, S31254, 
S32654, N08810, N08811, and N08926, shall consist of 
heating the material to a minimum temperature of 1900 °F 
[1040 °C] followed by a rapid cooling to below 700 °F [370 
°C]. The cooling rate shall be sufficiently rapid to prevent 
harmful carbide precipitation as determined in Section 13. 
8.2 UNS N08367 shall be solution annealed at 2025 °F 
[1107 °C] minimum followed by rapid quenching. 
8.3 N08926 shall be heat-treated at a minimum temperature 
of 2010 °F [1100 °C] followed by quenching in water or 
rapidly cooling by other means. 
8.4 S31254, S32654, and N08811 shall be solution annealed 
at 2100 °F [1150 °C] minimum followed by rapid quenching. 
8.5 N08810 shall be heat-treated to a minimum temperature 
of 2050 °F [1120 °C] minimum followed by rapid quenching. 
8.6 If heat treatment of U-bends is specified, it shall satisfy 
the annealing procedure described above, and shall be done as 
follows: 
8.6.1 The heat treatment shall be applied to the U-bend area 
plus approximately 6 in. [150 mm] of each leg beyond the 
tangent point of the U-bend. 
8.6.2 If the heat treatment specified in 8.6 is accomplished 
by resistance-heating methods wherein electrodes are clamped 
to the tubes, the clamped areas shall be visually examined for 
arc bums. Burn indications shall be cause for rejection unless 
they can be removed by local polishing without encroaching 
upon minimum wall thickness. 
8.6.3 Temperature control shall be accomplished through 
the use of optical or emission pyrometers, or both. No 
temperature-indicating crayons, lacquers, or pellets shall be 
used. 
8.6.4 The inside of the tube shall be purged with a protective 
or an inert gas atmosphere during heating and cooling to below 
700 °F [370 °C] to prevent scaling of the inside surface. The 
atmosphere should be noncarburizing. 
9. Surface Condition 
9.1 The straight tubes, after final annealing, shall be pickled 
using a solution of nitric and hydrofluoric acids followed by 
flushing and rinsing in water. If bright annealing is performed, 
this requirement does not apply. 
9.2 Alight oxide scale on the outside surface ofU-bend area 
shall be permitted for tubes which have been electric-resistance 
heat treated after bending. 
10. Chemical Composition 
10.1 Product Analysis: 
10.1.1 When requested in the purchase order, a product 
analysis shall be made by the supplier from one tube or coil of 
steel per heat. The chemical composition shall conform to the 
requirements shown in Table 1. 
10.1.2 A product analysis tolerance of Specification A480/ 
A480M shall apply. The product analysis tolerance is not 
applicable to the carbon content for material with a specified 
maximum carbon of 0.04 % or less. 
10.1.3 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be 
made. Both retests, for the elements in question, shall meet the 
requirements of this specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot shall be rejected, or at the option of 
the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or tube may be 
individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat-rolled stock 
or tubes that do not meet the requirements of this specification 
shall be rejected. 
11. Mechanical Requirements 
11.1 Tensile Properties: 
11.1.1 The material shall conform to the tensile properties 
shown in Table 2. 
11.1.2 One tension test shall be made on a specimen for lots 
of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall be made on 
specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 tubes. 
11.2 Hardness: 
11.2.1 Grade TP XM-29 and N08367 tubes shall have a 
hardness number not exceeding 100 HRB or its equivalent. 
Tubes of all other grades shall have a hardness number not 
1122
