A Camber is the deviation of a side edge from a straight line and measurement is 
taken by placing a 2400 mm straightedge on the concave side and measuring the 
greatest distance between the strip edge and the straightedge.

A Camber is the greatest deviation of a side edge from a straight line and 
measurement is taken by placing an 8-ft [2438 mm] straightedge on the concave 
side and measuring the greatest distance between the sheet edge and the 
straightedge.
