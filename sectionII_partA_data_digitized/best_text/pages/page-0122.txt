3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 as-rolled-for plates, the condition of a plate that has 
been hot-rolled and will not be or has not yet been heat treated. 
3.1.1.1 Discussion-The term as-rolled by itself is not 
meant to refer to plates that have been hot-rolled using control­
rolling (CR), direct quench (DQT), thermo-mechanical control 
rolling (TMCP), recrystalization control rolling (RCR), or any 
similar methods that ate intended to produce a set of properties 
that are not normally achievable were they not employed. The 
term as-rolled is to be distinguished from the established term 
70 
plate-as-rolled that does not define the actual condition of a 
plate, but defines the singular product of a slab or ingot that has 
been hot-rolled 
3.1.2 coil-hot-rolled steel in coil form for processing into 
finished plates. 
3.1.3 exclusive-when used in relation to ranges, as for 
ranges of thicknesses in the tables of permissible variations in 
dimensions, the term is intended to exclude only the greater 
value of the range. Thus, a range from 60 to 72 in. [1500 to 
1800 mm] exclusive includes 60 in. [1500 mm], but does not 
include 72 in. [1800 mm]. 
3.1.4 heat treatment terms-see 3.1.11, and Terminology 
A941. 
3.1.5 hot forming-a forming operation producing penna­
nent deformation, performed after the plate has been heated to 
the temperature required to produce grain refinement. 
3.1.6 hot-rolled (hot rolling)-for plates, the process de­
scribed for a plate that has been rolled from a slab or ingot 
whose starting temperature is suitably above the recrystalliza­
tion temperature of the metal to be rolled. 
3.1.6.1 Discussion-Hot-rolled may be used in conjunction 
with any rolling process to more effectively describe a specific 
condition, for example; hot-rolled as-rolled; hot-rolled control­
rolled, etc. 
3.1.7 manufacturer-the organization that directly controls 
the conversion of steel ingots or slabs, by hot rolling, into 
plate-as-rolled or into coil; and for plates produced from 
plate-as-rolled, the organization that directly controls, or is 
responsible for, one or more of the operations involved in 
finishing the plates. Such finishing operations include leveling, 
cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, heat treat­
ment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for shipment, 
and certification. 
3.1.7.1 Discussion-The finishing operations need not be 
done by the organization that did the hot rolling of the plate. 
For plates produced from coil, see also 3.1.2. 
3.1.8 mill edge-the normal edge produced by rolling be­
tween horizontal finishing rolls. A mill edge does not conform 
to any definite contour. Mill edge plates have two mill edges 
and two trimmed edges. 
3.1.8.1 Discussion-Mill edge plates may at times be side­
trimmed on one or both sides at the discretion of the manu­
facturer. 
3.1.9 plate identifier-the alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric 
designation used to identify the plate. 
3.1.10 plates-flat hot-rolled steel, ordered to thickness or 
weight and typically to width and length, commonly available 
by size as follows: 
Width, in. [mm] 
Over 8 [200] 
Over 48 [1200] 
Thickness, in. [mm] 
over 0.229 [6.0 mm and over] 
over 0.179 [4.6 mm and over] 
3.1.10.1 Discussion-Steel plates are available in various 
thickness, width, and length combinations dependent upon 
equipment and processing capabilities of various manufactur­
ers and processors. Historic limitations of a plate based upon 
dimensions (thickness, width, and length) do not take into
