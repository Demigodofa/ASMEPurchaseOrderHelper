TABLE S1.2 Thickness Tolerances for Hot-Rolled Sheet (High-Strength, Low-Alloy Steel)-3/e-in. (Cut Edge) and ¾-in. (Mill Edge) 
Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut Lengths, Including Pickled) 
NoTE I-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than 3/s in. from a cut edge and not less than¾ in. from a mill edge. This table 
does not apply to the uncropped ends of mill edge coils. 
NoTE 2-Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in. 
[ 4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm]. 
Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements. 
NoTE 3-This table was used to construct Table 5 by multiplying the values in this table by 0.75 and rounding to 3 decimal places using standardASTM 
practice. 
NoTE 4-The thickness of material <1 in. wide shall be measured at mid-width.

TABLE S1 .3 Thickness Tolerances for Cold-Rolled Sheet (All Designations)A -%-in. Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut Lengths) 
NoTE I-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than 3/s in. from a side edge. 
NoTE 2-Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in. 
[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm].
