3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.l hardened condition, n-for F 23, the metallurgical 
condition achieved after normalizing and cooling to room 
temperature but prior to tempering. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order information necessary to purchase the needed 
material. In addition to the ordering information guidelines in 
Specification A961/A961M, orders should include the follow­
ing information: 
4.1.1 Additional requirements (see 7.2.1, Table 2 footnotes, 
9.3, and 19.2), and 
4.1.2 Requirement, if any, that manufacturer shall submit 
drawings for approval showing the shape of the rough forging 
before machining and the exact location of test specimen 
material (see 9.3.1). 
5. General Requirements 
5 .1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A961/A961M, including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase 
order. Failure to comply with the general requirements of 
Specification A961/A961M constitutes nonconformance with 
this specification. In case of conflict between the requirements 
of this specification and Specification A961/A961M, this 
specification shall prevail. 
6. Manufacture 
6.1 The low-alloy ferritic steels shall be made by the 
open-hearth, electric-furnace, or basic-oxygen process with the 
option of separate degassing and refining processes in each 
case. 
6.2 The stainless steels shall be melted by one of the 
following processes: ( a) electric-furnace (with the option of 
separate degassing and refining processes); (b) vacuum­
fumace; or ( c) one of the former followed by vacuum or 
electroslag-consumable remelting. Grade F XM-27Cb may be 
produced by electron-beam melting. 
6.3 A sufficient discard shall be made to secure freedom 
from injurious piping and undue segregation. 
6.4 Except as permitted in 6.4.2 and 6.4.3, the material shall 
be forged as close as practicable to the specified shape and size. 
6.4.1 Flanges, elbows, return bends, tees, and header tees 
shall not be machined directly from bar stock. Other parts 
whose longitudinal axis is not parallel to the longitudinal axis 
of the hollow bar or forged or rolled bar shall not be machined 
directly from bar. 
6.4.2 Parts may be machined from hollow bar or forged or 
rolled solution-annealed austenitic stainless steel bar without 
additional hot working provided the longitudinal axis of the 
part is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bar. 
6.4.3 Low alloy, martensitic stainless, ferritic stainless, and 
ferritic-austenitic stainless steel parts, NPS-4 [DN 100] and 
under, may be machined from hollow bar or forged or rolled 
bar, without additional hot working provided the longitudinal 
axis of the part is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bar.
