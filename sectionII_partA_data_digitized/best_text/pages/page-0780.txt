SA-449 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Hex Cap Screws, Bolts and Studs, Steel, Heat Treated, 120/ 
105/90 ksi Minimum Tensile Strength, General Use 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers quenched and tempered steel 
hex cap screws, bolts, and studs having a minimum tensile 
strength of 120 ksi for diameters 1.0 in. and smaller; 105 ksi for 
diameters over 1.0 in. to 1 ½ in.; and 90 ksi for diameters 1 ¾ 
in. to 3.0 in. inclusive. The term "fasteners" in this specification 
denotes hex cap screws, bolts, and studs. 
1.2 The fasteners are intended for general engineering use. 
1.3 The fasteners are furnished in diameters ¼ to 3.0 in. 
inclusive. They are designated by type denoting chemical 
composition as follows: 
Type 
Type I 
Type 2 
Type 3 
Description 
Plain carbon steel, carbon boron steel, alloy 
steel, or alloy boron steel 
Withdrawn 2003 
Weathering steel 
1.4 Terms used in this specification are defined in Termi­
nology Fl 789 unless otherwise defined in this specification. 
1.5 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as the standard. The values given in parentheses are provided 
for information purposes only. 
1.6 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica­
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.
