10.10.3.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool 
or file with a ¼-in. [6.4-rmn] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe. Said notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12½ % of the specified nominal wall thickness of 
the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.102 mm], whichever is greater. 
10.10.3.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] 
or less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to 
the tube axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to have a depth 
not exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of the 
pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. The length of 
the notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
10.10.3.4 More or smaller reference discontinuities, or both, 
may be used by agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
10.11 Standardization Procedure: 
10.11.1 The test apparatus shall be standardized at the 
beginning and end of each series of pipes of the same size 
(NPS or diameter and schedule or wall thickness), grade and 
heat treatment condition, and at intervals not exceeding 4 h. 
More frequent standardization may be performed at the manu­
facturer's option or may be required upon agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
10.11.2 The test apparatus shall also be standardized after 
any change in test system settings; change of operator; equip­
ment repair; or interruption due to power loss, process 
shutdown, or when a problem is suspected. 
10.11.3 The reference standard shall be passed through the 
test apparatus at the same speed and test system settings as the 
pipe to be tested. 
10.11.4 The signal-to-noise ratio for the reference standard 
shall be 2½ to 1 or greater. Extraneous signals caused by 
identifiable causes such as dings, scratches, dents, straightener 
marks, and so forth, shall not be considered noise. The 
rejection amplitude shall be adjusted to be at least 50 % of full 
scale of the readout display. 
10.11.5 If upon any standardization, the rejection amplitude 
has decreased by 29 % (3 dB) of peak height from the last 
standardization, the pipe since the last calibration shall be 
rejected. The test system settings may be changed, or the 
transducer(s), coil(s) or sensor(s) adjusted, and the unit 
restandardized, but all pipe tested since the last acceptable 
standardization must be retested for acceptance. 
10.12 Evaluation of Imperfections: 
10.12.1 Pipes producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
lowest signal produced by the reference standard(s) shall be 
identified and separated from the acceptable pipes. The area 
producing the signal may be reexamined. 
10.12.2 Such pipes shall be rejected if the test signal was 
produced by imperfections that cannot be identified or was 
produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. These pipes 
may be repaired in accordance with Sections 12 and 13. To be 
accepted, a repaired pipe must pass the same nondestructive 
644 
test by which it was rejected, and it must meet the minimum 
wall thickness requirements of this specification. 
10.12.3 If the test signals were produced by visual imper-
fections such as: 
(I) Scratches, 
(2) Surface roughness, 
(3) Dings, 
( 4) Straightener marks, 
(5) Cutting chips, 
(6) Steel die stamps, 
(7) Stop marks, or 
(8) Pipe reducer ripple. 
The pipe may be accepted based on visual examination 
provided the imperfection is less than 0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 
12½ % of the specified wall thickness (whichever is greater). 
10.12.4 Rejected pipe may be reconditioned and retested 
providing the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that 
required by this or the product specification. The outside 
diameter at the point of grinding may be reduced by the amount 
so removed. To be accepted, retested pipe shall meet the test 
requirement. 
10.12.5 If the imperfection is explored to the extent that it 
can be identified as non-rejectable, the pipe may be accepted 
without further test providing the imperfection does not en­
croach on the minimum wall thickness. 
11. Mechanical Tests Required 
11.1 Lot-For tension and flattening tests, the term "lot" 
shall be as follows: 
11.1.1 Where the final heat treated condition is obtained in 
a continuous furnace or by quenching after hot forming, the 
term lot shall apply to all pipes of the same specified outside 
diameter and specified wall thickness (or schedule) of the same 
heat, heat treated in the same furnace at the same temperature, 
time at heat, and furnace speed in the same production run, or 
all pipes of the same specified outside diameter and specified 
wall thickness (schedule) of the same heat, hot formed and 
quenched in the same production run. 
11.1.2 Where the final heat treated condition is obtained in 
a batch-type furnace equipped with recording pyrometers and 
automatically controlled within a 50 °F [30 °C] or lesser range, 
the term lot shall apply to all pipes of the same specified 
outside diameter and specified wall thickness (schedule) of the 
same heat, subjected to the same finishing temperature within 
the same production run. 
11.1.3 Where the final heat treated condition is obtained in 
a batch-type furnace not equipped with recording pyrometers 
and automatically controlled within a 50 °F [30 °C] or lesser 
range, the term lot shall apply to the larger of: (I) each 200 ft 
[60 m ] or fraction thereof and (2) those pipes heat treated in 
the same furnace batch charge for pipes of the same specified 
outside diameter and specified wall thickness (or schedule) that 
are produced from the same heat of steel and are subjected to 
the same finishing temperature within the same production run. 
11.2 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One tension 
test shall be made on a specimen for lots of not more than 100 
pipes. Tension tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes 
for lots of more than 100 pipes.
