TABLE S27.3 Permitted Variations From a Flat Surface for As-Rolled or Normalized High-Strength Low-Alloy Steel Plates Ordered to 
Half-Standard Flatness 
NoTE I-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Along the Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and the permitted 
variation from a flat surface along the length shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 12 ft in length, or in any 12 ft 
of longer plates. 
NoTE 2-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Across the Width-The permitted variation from a flat surface across the width shall not exceed the 
tabular amount for the specified width. 
NoTE 3-When the longer dimension is under 36 in., the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed 3/s in. in each direction. When the 
larger dimension is from 36 to 72 in., incl, the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount for the specified width, 
but in no case less than 3/s in. 
NoTE 4--This table and these notes cover the permitted variations from a flat surface for circular and sketch plates, based upon the maximum 
dimensions of those plates. 
NOTE 5-Permitted variations in waviness do not apply. 
NoTE 6-Plates must be in a horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured.

Half-Standard Flatness 
NoTE I-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Along the Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and the permitted 
variation from a flat surface along the length shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 3700 mm in length, or in any 
3700 mm of longer plates. 
NoTE 2-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Across the Width-The permitted variation from a flat surface across the width shall not exceed the 
tabular amount for the specified width. 
NoTE 3-When the longer dimension is under 900 mm, the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed 10 mm in each direction. When 
the larger dimension is from 900 to 1800 mm, incl., the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount for the specified 
width but in no case less than 10 mm. 
NOTE 4--This table and these notes cover the permitted variations from a flat surface for circular and sketch plates, based upon the maximum
