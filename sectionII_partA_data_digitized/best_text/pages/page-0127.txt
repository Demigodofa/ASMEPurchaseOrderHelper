11.4.4.5 If cooling rate data for the plate and cooling rate 
control devices for the test coupons are available, the test 
coupons may be heat treated separately in the device, provided 
that this method is approved by the purchaser. 
11.5 Test Specimen Preparation: 
11.5.1 Tension test specimens for plates¾ in. [20 mm] and 
under in thickness shall be the full thickness of the plates. The 
test specimens shall conform to the requirements for either the 
1 ½-in. [ 40-mm] wide or the ½-in. [12.5-mm] wide rectangular 
tension test specimen of Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
The 1 ½-in. [ 40-mm] wide test specimen may have both edges 
parallel. The ½-in. [12.5-mm] wide specimen may have a 
maximum nominal thickness of¾ in. [20 mm]. 
11.5.2 For plates up to 4 in. [100 mm], inclusive, in 
thickness, tension test specimens may be the full thickness of 
the plate and conform to the requirements for the 1 ½-in. 
[ 40-mm] wide rectangular tension test specimen of Test Meth­
ods and Definitions A370 if adequate testing machine capacity 
is available. 
11.5.3 For plates over¾ in. [20 mm] in thickness, except as 
permitted in 11.5.2, tension test specimens shall conform to the 
requirements for the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] diameter test speci­
men of Test Methods and Definitions A370. For plates between 
3/4 in. [20 mm] and 1-1/2 in. [40 mm] inclusive in thickness, the 
axis of the test specimen shall be located at 1/2 T, the center of 
the thickness. For plates over 1-1/2 in. [40 mm], the axis of the 
test specimen shall be located at l/4T, midway between the center 
of the thickness and the top or the bottom surface of the plate. 
11.6 Elongation Requirement Adjustments: 
11.6.1 Due to the specimen geometry effect encountered 
when using the rectangular tension test specimen for testing 
thin plate, adjustments in elongation requirements must be 
provided for thicknesses under 0.312 in. [8 mm]. Accordingly, 
the following deductions shall be made from the base elonga­
tion requirements in the applicable product specification: 
Elongation 
Deduction,% Plate Nominal Thickness Range, in. [mm] 
0.299-0.311 [7.60-7.89] 0.5 
0.286-0.298 [7.30-7.59] 1.0 
0.273-0.285 [7.00-7.29] 1.5 
0.259-0.272 [6.60-6.99] 2.0 
0.246-0.258 [6.20-6.59] 2.5 
0.233-D.245 [5.90-6.19] 3.0 
0.219-0.232 [5.50-5.89] 3.5 
0.206-0.218 [5.20-5.49] 4.0 
0.193-0.205 [4.90-5.19] 4.5 
less than 0.193 [4.90] 5.0 
11.6.2 Due to the inherently lower elongation that is obtain­
able in thicker plate, adjustments in elongation requirements in 
2-in. [50-mm] gage length shall be provided for thicknesses 
over 3.5 in. [90 mm]. Accordingly, the following deductions 
shall be made from the base elongation requirements in 2 in. 
[50 mm] prescribed in the applicable product specification: 
Elongation 
Deduction, % Plate Nominal Thickness Range, in. [mm] 
3.501-3.999 [90.00-102.49] 0.5 
4.000-4.499 [102.50-114.99] 1.0 
4.500-4.999 [115.00-127.49] 1.5 
5.000-5.499 [127.50-139.99] 2.0 
5.500-5.999 [140.0-152.49] 2.5 
6.000 and thicker [152.50 and thicker] 3.0 
11.6.3 A characteristic of certain types of alloy steels is a 
local disproportionate increase in the degree of necking down 
or contraction of the test specimens during the tension test, 
resulting in a decrease in the percentage of elongation as the 
75 
gage length is increased. The effect is not so pronounced in 
thicker plates. For such material, if so stated in the applicable 
product specification for plates up to¾ in. [20 mm], inclusive, 
in thickness, if the percentage of elongation of an 8-in. 
[200-mm] gage length test specimen falls not more than 3 
percentage points below the amount prescribed, the elongation 
shall be considered satisfactory if the percentage of elongation 
in 2 in. [50 mm] across the break is not less than 25 %. 
11.6.4 The tensile requirements tables in many of the 
product specifications covered by this general requirements 
specification specify elongation requirements in both 8-in. 
[200-mm] and 2-in. [50-mm] gage lengths. Unless otherwise 
provided in the applicable product specification, both require­
ments are not required to be applied simultaneously, and the 
elongation need only be determined in the gage length appro­
priate for the test specimen used. After selection of the 
appropriate gage length, the elongation requirement for the 
alternative gage length shall be deemed not applicable. 
11. 7 This specification does not provide requirements for 
product tension testing subsequent to shipment (see 15.1). 
Therefore, the requirements of 11.1 through 11.6 and Section 
16 apply only for tests conducted at the place of manufacture 
prior to shipment. Compliance to Specification A20/20M and 
the applicable product specification does not preclude the 
possibility that product tension test results may vary outside 
specified ranges. The tensile properties will vary within the 
same plate-as-rolled or piece, be it as-rolled, control-rolled, or 
heat-treated. The purchaser should, therefore, be aware that 
tension testing in accordance with the requirements of Speci­
fication A20/ A20M does not provide assurance that all prod­
ucts of a plate-as-rolled will be identical in tensile properties 
with the products tested; If the purchaser wishes to have more 
confidence than that provided by Specification A20/ A20M 
testing procedures, additional testing or requirements, such as 
Supplementary Requirement S4, should be imposed. 
11.8 Appendix X2 provides additional information on the 
variability of tensile properties in plates for pressure vessels. 
12. Notch-Toughness Tests 
12.1 Charpy V-Notch Tests: 
12.1.1 Number of Tests-If Charpy V-Notch tests are 
specified, except for quenched and tempered plates, and except 
as allowed by 12.1.1.1 and 12.1.1.2, one impact test (3 
specimens) for each specified orientation (see 12.1.2) shall be 
made from each plate-as-rolled. For quenched and tempered 
plates, one impact test shall be made from each plate, as heat 
treated. 
12.1.1.1 Plates Ordered Without the Heat Treatment Speci­
fied by the Applicable Product Specification-Coupons for 
Charpy V-notch tests shall be taken in accordance with the 
same requirements as given for tensile test coupons in 11.4.2 
and 11.4.3. 
12.1.1.2 Plates Produced from Coil-If Charpy V-notch 
tests are specified, the number of impact tests required shall be 
the same as the number specified for tension tests in 11.1.2 or 
11.1.3, whichever is applicable. The test coupons shall be taken 
from the material after decoiling and leveling.
