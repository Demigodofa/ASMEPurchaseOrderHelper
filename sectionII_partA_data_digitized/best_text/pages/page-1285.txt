6.3.1 Two tension tests shall be made to represent bars of 
the same size from each heat in each heat treatment charge. For 
continuous heat-treated material, not fewer than two tension 
tests shall represent a lot selected on the basis of one tension 
test from each 10 000 lb (4500 kg). 
6.3.2 When heat treated without interruption in continuous 
furnaces, the material in a lot shall be from the same heat, same 
prior condition, same size, and subjected to the same heat 
treatments. 
6.4 Test Methods-Tension test~ shall be made in accor­
dance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. The yield 
strength shall be determined by the 0.2 % offset method. 
7. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
7 .1 Wbrkmanship-The bars shall be free of pipe, cracks, 
and flakes. Within the limits of good manufacturing and 
inspection practices the bars shall be free of injurious seams, 
laps, segregation, or other imperfections which, due to their 
nature, degree or extent, will interfere with the use of the 
material in machining or fabrication. 
7.2 Descaling-Unless otherwise specified, the bars shall be 
descaled. 
8. General Requirements 
8.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A29/ A29M. 
9. Certification and Test Reports 
9.1 A manufacturer's certification that the material was 
manufactured and tested in accordance with this specification 
together with a report of the analysis and tensfon test results 
shall be furnished at the time of shipment. The report shall 
include the name of the manufacturer, ASTM designation 
number and year date and revision letter, if any, grade, heat 
number, and size. 
10. Product Marking 
10.1 The bars shall be marked in accordance with Specifi­
cation A29/ A29M except as modified or supplemented by 10.2 
through 10.4 of this specification. 
10.2 When specified by the purchaser, the heat number shall 
be permanently stamped on one end of each bar 2.50 in. and 
larger in nominal diameter (or equivalent cross-sectional area). 
10.3 The bars shall neither be hot nor cold stamped on the 
sides unless approved by the purchaser on the purchase order. 
10.4 Each lift, regardless of size, shall be tagged with the 
information required by Specification A29/ A29M.
