3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 Steel Types: 
3.1.2 carbon steel, n-designation for steel when no mini­
mum content is specified or required for aluminum, chromium, 
cobalt, columbium, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, tungsten, 
vanadium, zirconium, or any element added to obtain a desired 
alloying effect; when the specified minimum for copper does 
not exceed 0.40 %; or when the maximum content specified for 
any of the following elements does not exceed the percentages 
noted: manganese 1.65, silicon 0.60, or copper 0.60.

3.1.2.1 Discussion-In all carbon steels small quantities of 
certain residual elements unavoidably retained from raw ma­
terials are sometimes found which are not specified or required, 
such as copper, nickel, molybdenum, chromium, and so forth. 
These elements are considered as incidental and are not 
normally determined or reported. 
3.1.3 high-strength, low-alloy steel, n-specific group of 
steels in which higher strength, and in some cases additional 
resistance to atmospheric corrosion or improved formability, 
are obtained by moderate amounts of one or more alloying 
elements. 
3.1.4 Product Types: 
3.1.5 hot-rolled sheet, n-manufactured by hot-rolling slabs 
in a continuous mill to the required thickness and can be 
supplied in coils or cut lengths as specified. 
( 1) Hot-rolled carbon steel sheet is commonly classified by 
size as follows: 
Width, in. 
All WidthsA 
Coils and Cut Lengths 
Thickness, in. 
0.027 to 0.230, excl 
A Hot-rolled sheet in coils and cut lengths less than 12 in. in width must have cut 
edges. Hot-rolled material with mill edges 12 in. and less in width is considered 
hot-rolled strip. 
Width, mm 
All WidthsA 
Coils and Cut Lengths 
Thickness, mm 
0.7 to 6.0, excl 
A Hot-rolled sheet in coils and cut lengths less than 300 mm. in width must have 
cut edges. Hot-rolled material with mill edges 300 mm and less in width is 
considered hot-rolled strip. 
(2) Hot-rolled high-strength low-alloy steel sheet is com­
monly classified by size as follows: 
Width, in. 
All WidthsA 
Coils and Cut Lengths 
Thickness, in. 
0.031 to 0.230, excl 
A Hot-rolled sheet in coils and cut lengths less than 12 in. in width must have cut 
edges. Hot-rolled material with mill edges 12 in. and less in width is considered 
hot-rolled strip.

NoTE 2-The changes in width limits with the publication of A568/ 
A568M - 06a result in a change in tensile testing direction for material 
from 0.180 in. [4.5 mm] to 0.230 in. exclusive [6.0 mm exclusive] over 
48 in. [1200 mm] wide. Material formerly tested in the transverse 
direction will be tested in the longitudinal direction. This is expected to 
result in some changes in reported properties. The purchaser is advised to 
discuss this change with the supplier. 
3.1.6 cold-rolled sheet, n-manufactured from hot-rolled 
descaled coils by cold reducing to the desired thickness, 
generally followed by annealing to recrystallize the grain 
structure. If the sheet is not annealed after cold reduction it is 
known as full hard with a hardness of 84 HRB minimum and 
can be used for certain applications where ductility and flatness 
are not required. 
( 1) Cold-rolled carbon sheet is commonly classified by size 
as follows:
