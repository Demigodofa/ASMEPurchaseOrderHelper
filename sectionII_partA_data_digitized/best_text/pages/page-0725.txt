3. Common Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A960/ A960M including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase 
order. Failure to comply with the common requirements of 
Specification A960/A960M constitutes nonconformance with 
this specification. In case of conflict between this specification 
and Specification A960/ A960M, this specification shall pre­
vail. 
3.2 Specification A960/A960M identifies the ordering infor­
mation that should be complied with when purchasing material 
to this specification. 
4. Material 
4.1 The material for fittings shall consist of forgings, bars, 
plates, or seamless or welded tubular products that conform to 
the chemical requirements in Table 2. See Table 3 for a list of 
common names. 
4.2 The steel shall be melted by one of the following 
processes: 
4.2.1 Electric furnace (with separate degassing and refining 
optional), 
4.2.2 Vacuum furnace, or 
4.2.3 One of the former followed by vacuum or electroslag­
consumable remelting. 
4.3 If secondary melting is employed, the heat shall be 
defined as all ingots remelted from a primary heat. 
4.4 Grain Size-Annealed Alloys UNS N08810 and UNS 
N08811 shall conform to an average grain size of ASTM No. 
5 or coarser. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 Forming-Forging or shaping operations may be per­
formed by hammering, pressing, piercing, extruding, upsetting, 
rolling, bending, fusion welding, machining, or by a combina­
tion of two or more of these operations. The forming procedure 
shall be so applied that it will not produce injurious defects in 
the fittings. 
5.2 All fittings shall be heat treated in accordance with 
Section 6. 
5.3 Grade WP fittings ordered as Class S shall be of 
seamless construction and shall meet all requirements of 
ASME B16.9, ASME B16.ll, MSS SP-79, MSS SP-83, MSS 
SP-95, or MSS SP-97. 
5.4 Grade WP fittings ordered as Class W shall meet the 
requirements of ASME B16.9 and: 
5.4.1 Shall have all pipe welds made by mill or the fitting 
manufacturer with the addition of filler metal radiographically 
examined throughout the entire length in accordance with the 
Code requirements stated in 5.5, and, 
5.4.2 Radiographic inspection is not required on single 
longitudinal seam welds made by the starting pipe manufac­
turer if made without the addition of filler metal; and 
5.4.3 Radiographic inspection is not required on longitudi­
nal seam fusion welds made by the fitting manufacturer when 
all of the following conditions have been met: 
5.4.3.1 No addition of filler metal, 
5.4.3.2 Only one welding pass per weld seam, and, 
5.4.3.3 Fusion welding from one side only. 
5.4.4 In place of radiographic examination, welds made by 
the fitting manufacturer may be ultrasonically examined in 
accordance with the Code requirements stated in 5.6. 
5.5 Grade WP fittings ordered as Class WX shall meet the 
requirements of ASME B 16. 9 and shall have all welds, whether 
made by the fitting manufacturer or the starting material 
manufacturer, radiographically exf[mined throughout their en­
tire length in accordance with Paragraph UW-51 of Section 
Vill, Division I, of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
5.6 Grade WP fittings ordered as Class WU shall meet the 
requirements of ASME B16.9 and shall have all welds, whether 
made by the fitting manufacturer or the starting material 
manufacturer, ultrasonically examined throughout their entire 
length in accordance with Appendix 12 of Section VITI, 
Division 1 of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.

5.7 The radiography or ultrasonic examination of welds for 
this class of fittings may be done at the option of the 
manufacturer, either prior to or after forming.
