SPECIFICATION REMOVAL 
From time to time, it becomes necessary to remove specifications from this Part of Section II. This occurs because the 
sponsoring society (e.g., ASTM, AWS, CEN) has notified ASME that the specification has either been replaced with an­
other specification, or that there is no known use and production of a material. Removal of a specification from this Sec­
tion also results in concurrent removal of the same specification from Section IX and from all of the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Construction Codes that reference the material. This action effectively prohibits further use of the ma­
terial in ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel construction. 
The following specifications will be dropped from this Section in the next Edition, unless information concerning cur­
rent production and use of the material is received before December 1 of this year: 
SF-568M 
If you are currently using and purchasing new material to this specification for ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code 
construction, and if discontinuance of this specification would present a hardship, please notify the Secretary of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee, at the address shown below:
