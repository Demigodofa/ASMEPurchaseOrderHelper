SA-350/SA-350M (ASTM A350/A350M} ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
In addition to any supplementary requirements of Specification A961/A961M, the following 
supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the order: 
Sl. Other Impact Test Temperatures 
S 1.1 Impact test temperatures lower or higher than the 
standard temperature in Table 4 of this specification shall be 
used. 
S 1.1.1 When higher test temperatures are employed, the 
actual test temperature may not be higher than that given in 
Table Sl.1.1. 
S 1.2 The test temperature shall be specified by the pur­
chaser. When subsize specimens are used, the manufacturer 
shall adjust the test temperature in accordance with the size 
restrictions of 7.2.4.2 and 7.2.4.3. 
Sl.3 The forging shall be marked with the specified test 
temperature in accordance with 15.1.5. A lower temperature 
shall not be marked on the forging because of the use of 
subsize specimens. 
S 1 .4 The test results shall comply with Table 3 for standard 
size specimens, and with Table 5 for subsize specimens. 
S2. Stress-Relieved Test Specimens 
S2. l The test specimens shall be stress relieved. Stress 
relieving shall be done after heat treatment in 5.4 and before 
machining the specimens from the heat-treated test material. 
S2.2 The purchaser shall furnish the forging manufacturer 
with details of the stress-relief treatment desired. 
S3. Lateral Expansion 
S3.l Lateral expansion of the Charpy V-notch test shall be 
measured and reported.

S4. Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized Steels 
S4.1 Material made to Grades LFl, LF2, LF3, LF5, and LF9 
shall be vacuum carbon-deoxidized, in which case the silicon 
content shall be 0.12 % maximum. The test report shall 
indicate that the steel was vacuum carbon-deoxidized. 
SS. Special Impact Test Requirements for Flanges (Note 
SS.1) 
S5.l Charpy test specimens shall be cut from an actual 
flange representing each size, heat, and heat-treatment lot. If 
more than one size flange is represented by the same heat and 
heat-treatment lot, the maximum size flange shall be consid­
ered representative. 
536 
S5.2 The number, location, and orientation of the test 
specimens shall be stated on the order. 
S5.3 The test results shall comply with Table 3 for standard 
size specimens, and with Table 5 for subsize specimens. 
Norn S5.1-These special requirements should be considered for 
services when the applied stresses approach the maximum permissible 
limits of the governing code, or the installation is subject to severe cyclic 
conditions (7000 or more cycles over the expected life of the installation), 
or both. 
S6. Carbon Equivalent 
S6.l The maximum carbon equivalent based on heat analy­
sis shall be as shown in Table S6.1.

S6.3 A lower maximum carbon equivalent may be agreed 
upon between the supplier and the purchaser.
