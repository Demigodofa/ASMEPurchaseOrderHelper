AWhen tubes as ordered require wall thicknesses¾ in. [19 mm] or over, or an inside diameter 60 % or less of the outside diameter, a wider variation in wall thickness is 
required. On such sizes a variation in wall thickness of 12.5 % over or under will be permitted. 
For tubes less than½ in. [12.7 mm] in inside diameter which cannot be successfully drawn over a mandrel, the wall thickness may vary ±15 % from that specified. 
8 These tolerances apply to cut lengths up to and including 24 ft [7.3 m]. For lengths greater than 24 ft [7.3 m], the above over tolerances shall be increased by 1/a in. [3 
mm] for each 10 ft [3 m] or fraction thereof over 24 ft, or½ in. [13 mm), whichever is lesser. 
c Ovality provisions of 12.2 apply. 
finished tubes. For tubes over 8 in. [203.2 mm] in outside 
diameter, or tubes with wall thickness 3/s in. [9.52 mm] and 
over, the flattening test may be performed instead of the flange 
test unless the flange test is specified in the purchase order. 
14.4 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot. 
14.5 When more than one heat is involved, the tension, 
flaring, flanging, and hardness test requirements shall apply to 
each heat. 
14.6 Reverse Flattening Test-For welded tubes, one re­
verse flattening test shall be made on a specimen from each 
1500 ft [450 m] of finished tubing. 
15. Intergranular Corrosion Test 
15.1 If intergranular corrosion testing is specified in the 
purchase order, the test shall be made in accordance with 
Practices A763, using samples prepared as agreed upon be­
tween the seller and the purchaser. 
16. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
16.1 Each tube, seamless or welded, shall be subjected to 
the nondestructive electric test or the hydrostatic test. The type 
of test to be used shall be at the option of the manufacturer, 
unless otherwise specified in the purchase order. 
17. Product Marking 
17 .1 In addition to the marking desc1ibed in Specification 
A1016/A1016M, the marking shall indicate whether the tubing 
is seamless or welded.
