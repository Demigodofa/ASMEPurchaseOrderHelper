9.3.1.3 Indications whose amplitude equals or exceeds that 
of the back reflection established in an indication-free area of 
the forging. 
9.3.2 Angle Beam Inspection: 
9.3.2.1 Calibration notches shall be cut into the inside- and 
outside-diameter surfaces with a depth equal to 3 % of the 
nominal section thickness (or 3 /s in. [9.5 mm], max), a length of 
approximately 1 in. [25 mm], and a width not greater than 
twice its depth. Adjust instrument controls to obtain an 
indication from the inside-diameter notch approximately 75 % 
of full screen height. Measure the amplitude of indication from 
the outside-diameter notch. Draw a straight line on the shield in 
front of the cathode ray tube from this peak to that of the 
inside-diameter notch and continue it as a horizontal line to the 
initial pulse. This line constitutes the angle beam reference 
line. 
9.3.2.2 A forging containing a discontinuity which results in 
an indication exceeding the amplitude of the reference line is 
subject to rejection. 
Norn 6-Signals from discontinuities within approximately ¼ in. 
[6.4 mm] of inside and outside surfaces are reinforced by wave trapping 
during angle beam inspection; they are therefore amplified in respect to 
internal discontinuities. 
9.3.3 The report of the ultrasonic inspection shall be in 
compliance with Section 8 of Practice A388/A388M. 
9.3.4 Additional nondestructive inspection or trepanning 
may. be employed to resolve questions of interpretation of 
ultrasonic indications. The manufacturer shall accept respon­
sibility for injurious indications which will not be removed in 
final machining. 
10. Repair Welding 
10.1 Repair welding of forgings may be permitted, but only 
at the option of the purchaser. 
10.2 If repair welding is performed, welders and weld 
procedures shall be qualified in accordance with Section IX of 
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
11. Certification and Reports 
11.1 In addition to items to be reported by Specification 
A788/A788M, the following items shall also be reported: 
11.1.1 Product chemical analysis, 
11.1.2 The method used for locating test specimens, and 
11.1.3 Sketches showing the locations of all recordable 
indications in the report of all nondestructive examinations. 
11.1.3.1 If Practice A966/A966M has been used, this also 
shall be recorded in the certification. 
11.1.4 Details of the heat treatment cycle, as listed in 
Specification A 788/ A 788M. 
12. Product Marking 
12.1 The purchaser may specify additional identification 
marking and the location of the stamping. The type of stamps 
to be used when impression stamping is performed shall be 
round-nosed or "interrupted-dot" die stamps having a mini­
mum radius of .½2 in. [0.8 mm]. 
13. Keywords 
13.1 chromium-molybdenum steel; nickel-chromium­
molybdenum alloy steels; pressure vessel service; quenched 
and tempered steels; steel forgings-alloy; steel forgings­
carbon; vacuum-treated steels 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the 
purchaser in the inquiry or order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be agreed upon 
between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
Sl. Simulated Post-Weld Heat Treatment of Mechanical 
Test Samples 
S 1.1 All test coupons shall be subjected to single or multiple 
heat treatments at subcritical temperatures prior to testing. 
Such treatments are intended to simulate post-weld or other 
treatments to which the forgings will be subjected during 
subsequent fabrication. The purchaser shall furnish the manu­
facturer with details of the desired heat treatment for the test 
coupons, including temperatures, timers, and cooling rates. 
S2. Ultrasonic Testing-Reference Block Calibration (for 
examining sections 24-in. [610 mm] thick or less) 
S2.1 Reference blocks of acoustically similar metal shall be 
used for calibration. Blocks shall meet one of the following 
requirements: 
S2.l.1 A comparison of the back reflections between 
equivalent thicknesses of the reference block material and the 
actual forging to be tested, without change in instrument 
setting shall not show a variation in excess of 25 %. 
842 
S2.l.2 The reference blocks shall be manufactured from 
steel that is similar in chemistry and processing history to the 
production forging being tested. The reference blocks shall be 
fabricated in accordance with the procedures of Practice E428. 
S2.2 For test sections up to 12 in. [305 mm] thick, the 
reference blocks shall contain a ¼-in. [6.4-mm] diameter 
flat-bottom hole; for over 12 to 18 in. [305 to 457 mm], the 
hole diameter shall be 3/s in. [9.5 mm]; and for over 18 to 24 in. 
[457 to 610 mm], it shall be ½ in. [13 mm]. 
S2.3 A distance-amplitude correction curve shall be estab­
lished for the proper grade of steel and specified hole size. 
S2.4 A forging containing one or more indications equal in 
amplitude to that of the applicable reference hole, when 
properly corrected for distance, is subject to rejection. 
S3. Charpy V-Notch Impact Transition Curve 
S3.l Sufficient impact tests shall be made from the forging 
test material to establish a temperature-absorbed energy curve. 
The test-temperature range shall be wide enough to establish
