TABLE 7 Number of Tubes in a Lot Heat Treated by the 
Continuous Process or by Direct Quench After Hot Forming 
Size of Tube 
2 in. [50.8 mm] and over in outside 
diameter and 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] and over 
in wall thickness 
2 in. [50.8 mm] and over in outside 
diameter and 
under 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] in wall thickness 
Less than 2 in. [50.8 mm] but over 1 in. 
[25.4 mm] in outside diameter 
1 in. [25.4 mm] or less in outside diameter 
final heat treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall 
include only those tubes of the same size and from the same 
heat that are heat treated in the same furnace charge. When the 
final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace or when the 
heat-treated condition is obtained directly by quenching after 
hot forming, the number of tubes of the same size and from the 
same heat in a lot shall be determined from the size of the tubes 
as prescribed in Table 7. 
15.2 For tensile and hardness test requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same size (see 4.1.7) 
that are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only 
those tubes of the same size and the same heat that are heat 
treated in the same furnace charge. When the final heat 
treatment is in a continuous furnace, or when the heat-treated 
condition is obtained directly by quenching after hot forming, 
a lot shall include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat 
treated in the same furnace at the same temperature, time at 
heat, and furnace speed; or all tubes of the same size and heat, 
hot formed and quenched in the same production run, except as 
prescribed in 9.1.3. 
Size of Lot 
not more than 50 tubes 
not more than 75 tubes 
not more than 75 tubes 
not more than 125 tubes 
16. Product Marking 
16.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A1016/A1016M, the marking shall include: the condition, hot 
finished or cold finished; and the wall designation, minimum 
wall or average wall. 
16.2 For the austenitic stainless steels having a grain size 
requirement (see Table 3) the marking shall also include the 
heat number and heat-treatment lot identification. 
16.3 When either T2 or T12 are ordered with higher sulfur 
contents as permitted by Note B of Table 1, the marking shall 
include the letter, S, following the grade designation: T2S or 
T12S. 
16.4 For T91, the marking shall also include the type.
