XI. NUCLEAR REACTOR BELTLINE CONSIDERATIONS-RESIDUAL ELEMENTS 
Xl .1 Reactor design requires review and control of residual 
elements that affect the material properties. Copper and phos­
phorus are limited to levels determined by the total fluence to 
be encountered during plant life. Vanadium and sulfur can 
affect the upper energy shelf level. In the case of sulfur, control 
of this element or its morphology in the plate, or both, may 
offer alternative means of control. The limits required shall be 
specified in the ordering data. The following table itemizes 
currently available commercial limits for the referenced ele­
ments:
