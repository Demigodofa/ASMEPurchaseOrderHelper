INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
General Requirements for Flat-Rolled Stainless and Heat­
Resisting Steel Plate, Sheet, and Strip 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A480/A480M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers a group of general require­
ments that, unless otherwise specified in the purchase order or 
in an individual specification, shall apply to rolled steel plate, 
sheet, and strip, under each of the following specifications 
issued by ASTM: Specifications A240/A240M, A263, A264, 
A265, A666, A693, A793, and A895. 
1.2 In the case of conflict between a requirement of a 
product specification and a requirement of this specification, 
the product specification shall prevail. In the case of conflict 
between a requirement of the product specification or a 
requirement of this specification and a more stringent require­
ment of the purchase order, the purchase order shall prevail. 
The purchase order requirements shall not take precedence if 
they, in any way, violate the requirements of the product 
specification or this specification; for example, by waiving a 
test requirement or by making a test requirement less stringent. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The SI units are 
shown in brackets, except that when A480M is specified, 
Annex A3 shall apply for the dimensional tolerances and not 
the bracketed SI values in Annex A2. The values stated in each 
system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other, and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined. 
1.4 This specification and the applicable material specifica­
tions are expressed in both inch-pound and SI units. However, 
unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specification 
designation [SI units], the material shall be furnished in 
inch-pound units. 
1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AOl on Steel, 
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee 
AO 1.17 on Flat-Rolled and Wrought Stainless Steel.

dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
