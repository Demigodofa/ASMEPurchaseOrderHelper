ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-403 /SA-403M 
9. Hydrostatic Tests 
9.1 Hydrostatic testing is not required by this specification. 
9.2 All Grade WP fittings shall be capable of withstanding 
without failure, leakage, or impairment of serviceability, a test 
pressure equal to that prescribed for the specified matching 
pipe or equivalent material. 
9.3 All Grade CR fittings, except tees covered in 9.3.1, shall 
be capable of withstanding without failure, leakage, or impair­
ment of serviceability, a test pressure based on the ratings in 
MSS SP-43. 
9.3.1 Grade CR tees fabricated using intersection welds 
shall be capable of passing a hydrostatic test based on 70 % of 
the ratings in MSS SP-43. 
10. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion 
Protection 
10.1 The requirements of Specification A960/A960M apply 
except as modified as follows: 
10.2 Fittings supplied under this specification shall be 
examined visually. Selected typical surface discontinuities 
shall be explored for depth. The fittings shall be free from 
surface discontinuities that penetrate more than 5 % of the 
specified nominal wall thickness, except as defined in 10.4 and 
10.5, and shall have a workmanlike finish. 
10.3 Surface discontinuities deeper than 5 % of the speci­
fied nominal wall thickness, except as defined in 10.4 and 10.5, 
shall be removed by the manufacturer by machining or 
grinding to sound metal, and the repaired areas shall be well 
faired. The wall thickness at all points shall be at least 87½ % 
of the specified nominal wall thickness, and the diameters at all 
points shall be within the specified limits. 
10.4 Surface checks (fish scale) deeper than 1/64 in. [0.4 
mm] shall be removed. 
10.5 Mechanical marks deeper than ½6 in. [l.6 mm] shall 
be removed. 
10.6 When the removal of a surface discontinuity reduces 
the wall thickness below 87½ % of the specified nominal wall 
thickness at any point, the fitting shall be subject to rejection or 
to repair as provided in Section 11. 
10.7 The fittings shall be free of scale and shall be passi­
vated. 
11. Repair by Welding 
11.1 Repair of unacceptable imperfections in the base metal 
is permissible for fittings made to the dimensional standards 
listed in 1. 1 or for other standard fittings made for stock by the 
manufacturer. Prior approval of the purchaser is required to 
repair special fittings made to the purchaser's requirements. 
Welding of unacceptable imperfections in no case shall be 
permitted when the depth of defect exceeds 331/3 % of the 
nominal wall thickness or the defect area exceeds 10 % of the 
surface area of the fitting. 
11.2 The welding procedure and welders shall be qualified 
in accordance with Section IX of the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code. 
11.3 The composition of the weld deposits shall be in 
accordance with 7.3 and in accordance with the procedure 
qualification for the applicable material. 
11.4 Unacceptable imperfections shall be removed by me­
chanical means or by thermal cutting or gouging methods. 
Cavities prepared for welding shall be examined with liquid 
penetrant in accordance with Practice E165/E165M. No cracks 
are permitted in the prepared cavities. Personnel performing 
NDE examinations shall be qualified in accordance with 
SNT-TC-lA 
11.5 The weld repair shall be permanently identified with 
the welder's stamp or symbol in accordance with Section VIII 
of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
11.6 Weld repair area(s) shall be blended uniformly to the 
base metal and shall be examined by liquid penetrant in 
accordance with Practice E165/E165M. No cracks are permit­
ted in the weld or surrounding ½ in. [12.7 mm] of base metal. 
Personnel performing NDE examinations shall be qualified in 
accordance with SNT-TC-lA. 
11. 7 After weld repair, material shall be heat treated in 
accordance with Section 6. 
12. Dimensions 
12.1 For fittings covered by ASME B16.9, ASME B16.ll, 
MSS SP-43, MSS SP- 79, MSS SP-83, MSS SP-95, or MSS 
SP-97, the sizes, shapes, and dimensions of the fittings shall be 
as specified in those standards. 
12.1.1 Fittings of size or shape differing from these 
standards, but meeting all other requirements of this 
specification, may be furnished in accordance with Supplemen­
tary Requirement S58 Specification A960/A960M. 
13. Rejection and Rehearing 
13 .1 Material that fails to conform to the requirements of 
this specification may be rejected. Rejection should be reported 
to the producer or supplier promptly and in writing. In case of 
dissatisfaction with the results of the tests, the producer or 
supplier may make claim for rehearing. 
13.2 Fittings that develop defects in shop working or 
application operations may be rejected. Upon rejection, the 
manufacturer shall be notified promptly in w1iting. 
14. Certification 
14.1 Test reports are required for all fittings covered by this 
specification. Each test report shall meet the requirements for 
certification in Specification A960/ A960M as well as include 
the following information specific to this specification: 
681 
14.1.1 Chemical analyses results for all starting materials, 
Section 7. (Table 2), reported results shall be to the same 
number of significant figures as the limits specified in Table 2 
for that element, 
14.1.2 Tensile property results of all starting materials, 
Section 8 (Table 5), report the yield strength and the tensile 
strength in ksi [MPa] and elongation in percent,
