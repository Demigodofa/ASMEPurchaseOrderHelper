9.4.1 If the results of the tension test do not conform to the 
requirements specified in the product specification, retests are 
permitted as outlined in the test methods specified herein. If the 
results of any tension test specimen are less than specified 
because a flaw becomes evident in the test specimen dming 
testing, a retest shall be allowed provided that the defect is not 
attributable to ruptures, cracks, or flakes in the steel. 
9.4.2 If the average impact energy value meets the product 
specification requirements, but one energy value is below the 
specified minimum value for individual specimens, a retest is 
permitted. The retest shall be conducted in accordance with the 
test methods specified herein. 
9.5 For the purpose of determining conformance to the 
product specification requirements, specimens shall be ob­
tained from a finished product, or from production material that 
is in the same condition of working and heat treatment as the 
production material. 
10. Hardness Requirements 
10.1 The part shall conform to the hardness requirements 
prescribed in the product specification. 
10.2 Sampling for hardness testing shall conform to the 
product specification. 
11. Tensile Requirements 
11.1 The part shall conform to the tensile property require­
ments prescribed in the product specification. 
11.2 Sampling for tensile testing shall conform to the 
product specification. 
11.3 When the dimensions of the material to be tested will 
permit, the tension test specimens shall be machined to the 
form and dimensions of the standard 2-in. gauge length tension 
test specimens described in Test Methods and Definitions A370 
if inch-pound units are specified or the standard 62.5 mm 
gauge length tension test specimens described in the applicable 
track of Test Methods Al058 if SI units are specified. 
11.3 .1 In the case of small sections, which will not permit 
taking the standard test specimen described in 11.3, the subsize 
round or strip specimen shall be machined as described in the 
test methods being used. The tension test specimen shall be as 
large as feasible. 
12. Impact Requirements 
12.1 The part shall conform to the impact requirements 
prescribed in the product specification. 
12.2 Sampling for impact testing shall conform to the 
product specification. 
8 Product analysis limits for cobalt under 0.05 % have not been established and the 
12.3 Notched-bar impact specimens shall be simple-beam, 
Charpy-type A with a V-notch in accordance with Test Methods 
and Definitions A370 if the inch-pound units are specified or 
Test Methods A1058 if the M suffix (SI Units) standard is 
specified. Standard specimens 10 by 10 mm in cross section 
producer should be consulted for those limits. 
cNo over tolerance allowed.
