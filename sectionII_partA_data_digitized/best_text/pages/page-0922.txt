tolerances are double those shown in the table. 
8 Cold-finished flat bars over 4 ½ in. [115 mm] wide or thick are produced; width 
and thickness tolerances for such bars are not included herein.

8 Random Lengths-When ordered as random lengths, permissible variation is 
2 ft [0.6 m] over and under the specified length. When ordered as random lengths 
subject to a minimum length requirement, permissible variation is 2 ft [0.6 m] over 
and nothing under the specified length. 
° For lengths under 3 ft [1 m] and sizes up to ½ in. [13.00 mm] incl., the 
permissible variation in length is 1/32 in. [0.80 mm] over and nothing under.

straightedge. Unless otherwise specified, hot-finished or cold-finished bars 
for machining purposes are furnished machine straightened to the follow­
ing tolerances.

[13.00 mm]. 
TABLE 13 Permitted Variations for Hot-finished Angles 
NOTE I-For unequal leg angles, the longer leg determines the 
tolerance for the length of each leg. 
Wei hr' 
For angles of 6 lb/ft [9.0 kg/m] or less, the weight tolerances shall not exceed 
±7½ %. For angles over 6 lb/ft [9 kg/m], the weight tolerance shall not exceed 
±4½%. 
Length of Legs 
For angles having legs or flanges up to 6 in. [150 mm], incl, the length toler­
ance shall not exceed ± 1/s in. [3.00 mm]. For angles having legs or flanges over 
6 in., the length tolerance shall not exceed + 3/ta in. [5.00 mm] and-¼ in. 
Squareness of Legs 
The tolerance for the right angle between the legs is ±2°. 
A For equal leg angles, the theoretical weight per foot is: 
weighVfoot = (24 W x t - 12t 2 ) (0.2871 lb/ft) 
where: 
W specified length of the leg, in inches, and 
t specified thickness, in inches. 
For unequal leg angles, the theoretical weight per foot is: 
weighVfoot = [12 W1 x t+ 12 111,2 x t-12t 2 ] (0.2871 lb/ft) 
where: 
W1 and W2

bars and shapes and from each lot of forgings. Except for bars 
cut from strip or plate, tension tests of bars and shapes shall be 
made in the longitudinal direction or, at the manufacturer's 
option unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, in the 
transverse (through thickness) direction. Material tensile tested 
in the transverse direction and meeting the specified tensile 
property requirements need not be tested in the longitudinal 
direction. Testing for bars cut from strip or plate shall conform 
to the requirements of the applicable product specification for 
the strip or plate and to Specification A480/A480M. Hardness 
tests on bars shall be conducted midway between the center 
and surface of the product. Tension tests on forgings shall be 
prepared from suitable prolongations, or at the option of the 
supplier, excess forgings may be provided for test. All tests 
shall conform to the chemical and mechanical requirements of 
the product specification.

12.2 One intergranular corrosion test, when required, and 
one grain size test, when required shall be made on each lot. 
Often, it is convenient to obtain test material from the 
specimen selected for mechanical testing.
