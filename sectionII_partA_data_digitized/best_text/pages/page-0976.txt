SA-517 /SA-517M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, High-Strength, 
Quenched and Tempered 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers high-strength quenched and 
tempered alloy steel plates intended for use in fusion welded 
boilers and other pressure vessels. 
1.2 This specification includes a number of grades as 
manufactured by different producers, but all having the same 
mechanical properties and general characteristics. 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates furnished under this 
specification shall be as follows: 
Grade Thickness 
A, B 1.25 in. [32 mm] 
H, S 2 in. [50 mm] 
p 4 in. [100 mm] 
F 2.50 in. [65 mm] 
E, Q 6 in. [150 mm] 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system is to 
be used independently of the other without combining values in 
any way. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Plates furnished to this material specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/ A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and 
shall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of 
Specification A20/ A20M. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 Except as allowed by 5.2, the plates shall be heat treated 
by heating to not less than 1650°F [900°C], quenching in water 
or oil and tempering at not less than 1150°F [620°C]. 
5.2 Plates ordered without the heat treatment specified in 
5. I shall be stress relieved by the manufacturer, and subsequent 
heat treatment of the plates to conform to 5.1 shall be the 
responsibility of the purchaser. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements 
shown in Table l unless otherwise modified in accordance with
