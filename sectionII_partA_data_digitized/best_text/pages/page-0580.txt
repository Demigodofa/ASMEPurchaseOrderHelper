INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Carbon and Low-Alloy Steel Forgings, Requiring Notch 
Toughness Testing for Piping Components 1 
This standard is issned under the fixed designation A350/ A350M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers several grades of carbon and 
low-alloy steel forged or ring-rolled flanges, forged fittings and 
valves intended primarily for low-temperature service and 
requiring notch toughness testing. They are made to specified 
dimensions, or to dimensional standards, such as the ASME 
and API Specifications referenced in Section 2. Although this 
specification covers some piping components machined from 
rolled bar and seamless tubular materials (see 5.3.3), it does not 
cover raw material produced in these product forms. 
1.2 No limitation on size is intended beyond the ability of 
the manufacturer to obtain the specified requirements. 
However, Class 3 of Grade LF787 is only available in the 
quenched-and-precipitation heat treated condition. 
1.3 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when 
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply 
only when specified by the purchaser in the order. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, 
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee 
AOl.22 on Steel Forgings and Wrought Fittings for Piping Applications and Bolting 
Materials for Piping and Special Purpose Applications.
