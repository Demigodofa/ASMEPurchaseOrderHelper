3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 Austenitic Grades-All grades with a prefix of "8" or 
"9." 
3.1.2 Ferritic Grades-Grades 1, 2, 2H, 2HM, 3, 6, 6F, 7, 
7M, 43, and 16. 
3.1.3 Lot-Unless otherwise specified (see Discussion 
below), a lot is the quantity of nuts of a single nominal size and 
grade produced by the same manufacturing process. 
3.1.3.1 Discussion-When Supplementary Requirement S5 
is invoked on the purchase order, the following definitions of a 
lot shall apply: 
3.1.3.2 For Grade 8 Nuts-The quantity of all the nuts of a 
single nominal diameter and grade made from the same heat of 
steel and made by the same manufacturing process. 
3.1.3.3 For All Other Grade Nuts-(see 8.2 and 
8.1.2.1)-All the nuts of a single nominal diameter and grade 
made from the same heat number and heat treated in the same 
batch if batch-type heat treating equipment is used or heat 
treated in the same continuous run of not more than 8 h under 
the same conditions if continuous-type heat treating equipment 
is used. 
3.1.4 Type: 
3.1.4.1 For Grade 8 Nuts-Variations within the grade 
designated by a letter and differentiated by chemistry and by 
manufacturing process. 
3.1.4.2 For Grade 6 Nuts-Variations within the grade 
designated by the letter F as differentiated by chemical addi­
tions made for machineability. 
3.1.5 Series-The dimensional relationship and geometry of 
the nuts as described in ASME B 18.2.2 for inch nuts or ASME 
B 18.2.4.6M for metric nuts. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 The inquiry and order for bolting material and bolting 
components under this specification shall include the following 
as required to describe the items adequately: 
4.1.1 Specification designation, year date, ·and grade, issue 
date and revision letter, 
4.1.2 Quantity, number of pieces, 
4.1.3 Dimensions (see Section 9), 
4.1.4 Options in accordance with 8.2.2.1, 9.1, 9.2, 10.3, and 
12, and 
4.1.5 Supplementary Requirements, if any. 
4.2 Coatings-Coatings are prohibited unless specified by 
the purchaser (see Supplementary Requirements S7 and S8). 
When coated nuts are ordered, the purchaser should take 
special care to ensure that Appendix X2 is thoroughly under­
stood. 
4.3 See Supplementary Requirement S3 for nuts to be used 
in low temperature applications (Specification A320/A320M). 
4.4 Proof Load Testing-See Supplementary Requirement 
S9 for proof load testing of nuts manufactured to dimensions 
and configurations other than those covered in Tables 3 and 4. 
5. Common Requirements 
5.1 Bolting material and bolting components supplied to 
this specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci­
fication A962/ A962M, of which nuts are considered bolting 
components, as are bolts, studs, screws, and washers intended 
for use in special service applications. These requirements 
include test methods, finish, thread dimensions, marking, 
certification, optional supplementary requirements, and others. 
Failure to comply with the requirements of Specification 
A962/A962M constitutes nonconformance with this specifica­
tion. In case of conflict between the requirements of this 
specification and Specification A962/ A962M, this specification 
shall prevail. 
6. Manufacture (Process) 
6.1 Stainless steels for all types of Grade 6 and 8 nuts shall 
be made by one of the following processes: 
6.1.1 Electric- furnace ( with separate degassing and refining 
optional), 
6.1.2 Vacuum induction furnace, or 
6.1.3 Either of the above followed by electroslag remelting, 
or consumable-arc remelting. 
6.2 The steel producer shall exercise adequate control to 
eliminate excessive unhomogeneity, nonmetallics, pipe, 
porosity, and other defects. 
6.3 Grades 1 and 2 nuts shall be hot or cold forged, or shall 
be machined from hot-forged, hot-rolled, or cold-drawn bars. 
6.3.1 All Grade 1 and 2 nuts shall be stress-relieved at a 
temperature of at least 1000 °F [538 °C] after forming or 
machining from bar with the following exceptions: 
6.3.1.1 Nuts made by hot forging. 
249 
6.3.1.2 Nuts machined from hot-forged or hot-rolled bar. 
6.3.1.3 Nuts machined from hot-forged/hot-rolled and cold-
finished (max 10 % reduction in area) bar. 
6.3.1.4 Nuts machined from cold-drawn and annealed (min 
1000 °F [538 °C]) bar. 
6.3.2 Grade 1 and 2 nuts made by hot forging or by 
machining from hot-forged or hot-rolled bars need not be stress 
relieved.
