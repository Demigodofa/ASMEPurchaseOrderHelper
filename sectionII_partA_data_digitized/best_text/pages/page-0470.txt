SA-278/SA-278M ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Gray Iron Castings for Pressure-Containing Parts for 
Temperatures Up to 650°F (350°C) 
1. Scope 
l. 1 This specification covers gray iron for castings suitable 
for pressure-containing parts for use at temperatures up to 
650°F (350°C). 
1.2 Classes of Iron: 
1.2.1 Castings of all classes are suitable for use up to 450°F 
(230°C). For temperatures above 450°F and up to 650°F, only 
Class 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 castings are suitable. 
1.2.2 Castings of all classes are suitable for use up to 230°C. 
For temperatures above 230°C and up to 350°C, only Class 
275, 300, 325, 350, 380, and 415 castings are suitable. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may tesult in non-conformance 
with the standard.

3, Terminology 
3 .1 Definitions of many terms common to gray iron castings 
may be found in Tem1inology A644. 
4. Classification 
4.1 Classification by tensile strength. 
418 
4.1.1 Castings ordered to this specification are classified 
based upon the minimum tensile strength of the iron in ksi, in 
English units. Class 25 has a minimum specified tensile 
strength of 25 ksi. 
4.1.2 Castings ordered to this specification are classified 
based upon the minimum tensile strength of the iron in MPa, in 
Metric units. Class 150 has a minimum specified tensile 
strength of 150 MPa. 
5. Ordering Information 
5.1 Orders for material in this specification should include 
the following information: 
5.1.1 ASTM designation and year date, 
5.1.2 Class of iron required and service temperature, 
5. I.3 Quantity, 
5.1.4 Heat Treatment: 
5.1.4.1 Whether or not heat treatment is required for Class 
40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 castings to be used at temperatures at 
450°F or less (see 6.2), 
5.1.4.2 Whether or not heat treatment is required for Class 
275, 300, 325, 350, 380, and 415 castings to be used at 
temperatures at 230°C or less (see 6.2), 
5.1.5 The size of separately cast test bar to be poured (see 
Section 9 and Table 1), 
5.1.6 The size of test specimen to be machined from test 
bars C or S, and 
5 .1. 7 Special requirements. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 Castings intended for use above 450°F (230°C) shall be 
stress-relieved by placing them in a suitable furnace at a 
temperature not exceeding 400°F (200°C) and heating them 
uniformly to the temperatures and for the times specified in 
Table 2. The heating and cooling rates shall be uniform and 
shall not be more than 400°F/h (250°C/h) for castings of 1-in. 
(25-mm) maximum section. For heavier sections the maximum 
heating and cooling rates in degrees Fahrenheit per hour shall 
be 400 divided by the maximum section thickness. 
6.2 Heat Treatment and Cooling Rate: 
6.2. l Castings of Class Nos. 45, 50, 55, and 60, which axe to 
be used at temperatures below 450°F, may be heat treated in
