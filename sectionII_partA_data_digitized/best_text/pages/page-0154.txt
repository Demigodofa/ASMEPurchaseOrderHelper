1.2 In case of any conflict in requirements, the requirements 
of the purchase order, the individual material specification, .and 
this general specification shall prevail in the sequence named. 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall used 
independently of the other, and values from the two systems 
shall not be combined. 
1.4 For purposes of determining conformance to this speci­
fication and the various material specifications referenced in 
1.1, dimensional values shall be rounded to the nearest unit in 
the right-hand place of figures used in expressing the limiting 
values in accordance with the rounding method of Practice 
E29. 
NoTE I-Specification A29/A29M previously listed dimensional toler­
ances for cold-finished bars; these are now found in Specification A108. 
l .5 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
