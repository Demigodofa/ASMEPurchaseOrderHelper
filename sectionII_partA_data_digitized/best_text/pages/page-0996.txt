6.3 Product Analysis-Product analysis requirements and 
options, if any, are contained in the product specification. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7.1 Method of Mechanical Tests-The specimens and the 
mechanical tests required shall be made in accordance with 
Annex A2 of Test Methods and Definitions A370 if inch-pound 
units are specified, or to the requirements described in the 
applicable track of Test Methods A1058, if SI units are 
specified. 
7.2 Specimens shall be tested at room temperature. 
7.3 Small or subsize specimens as described in Test Meth­
ods and Definitions A370 or Test Methods A1058 may be used 
only when there is insufficient material to prepare one of the 
standard specimens. When using small or subsize specimens, 
the largest one possible shall be used. 
8. Tensile Requirements 
8.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in the individual specifications. 
8.2 The yield strength corresponding to a permanent offset 
of 0.2 % of the gage length or to a total extension of 0.5 % of 
the gage length under load shall be determined. 
8.3 If the percentage of elongation of any test specimen is 
less than that specified and any part of the fracture is more than 
¾ in. [19.0 mm] from the center of the gage length, as 
indicated by scribe marks on the specimen before testing, a 
retest shall be allowed. 
9. Permissible Variation in Weight 
9.1 The weight of any length of pipe NPS 12 [DN 300] and 
under shall not vary more than 10 % over or 3.5 % under that 
specified. For sizes over NPS 12 [DN 300], the weight of any 
length of pipe shall not vary more than 10 % over or 5 % under 
that specified. Unless otherwise specified, pipe of NPS 4 [DN 
100] and smaller may be weighed in convenient lots; pipe in 
sizes larger than NPS 4 [DN 100] shall be weighed separately. 
10. Permissible Variations in Wall Thickness 
----~ro;--1~seamless an e e no ller metal added)-The 
minimum wall thickness at any point shall be within the 
tolerances specified in Table 1, except that for welded pipe the

weld area shall not be limited by the over tolerance. The 
minimum wall thickness on inspection for - 12.5 % is shown 
in Table Xl.1. 
10.2 Forged and Bored-The wall thickness shall not vary 
over that specified by more than Vs in. [3.2 mm]. There shall be 
no variation under the specified wall thickness. 
10.3 Cast-The wall thickness shall not vary over that 
specified by more than V16 in. [1.6 mm]. There shall be no 
variation under the specified wall thickness. 
11. Permissible Variations in Inside Diameter 
11.1 Forged and Bored, and Cast-The inside diameter 
shall not vary under that specified by more than V16 in. [1.6 
mm]. There shall be no variation over the ·specified inside 
diameter. 
12. Permissible Variations in Outside Diameter 
12.1 Variations in outside diameter, unless otherwise 
specified, shall not exceed the limits prescribed in Table 2. The 
tolerances on outside diameter include ovality except as 
provided for in 12.2. 
12.2 Thin-wall pipe usually develops significant ovality 
(out-of-roundness) during final annealing, straightening, or 
both. The diameter tolerances of Table 2 are not sufficient to 
provide for additional ovality expected in thin-wall pipe and 
are applicable only to the mean of the extreme (maximum and 
minimum) outside diameter readings in any one cross-section. 
However, for thin-wall pipe the difference in extreme outside 
diameter readings (ovality) in any one cross-section shall not 
exceed 1.5 % of the specified outside diameter. 
13. Permissible Variations in Length 
13.1 Seamless and Welded (no filler metal added)-If defi­
nite cut lengths are ordered, no length of pipe shall be under the 
length specified and not more than ¼ in. [6 mm] over that 
specified. 
13.2 Forged and Bored, Cast, and Cast Cold-Wrought-If 
definite cut lengths are ordered, no length of pipe shall be 
length-spec-ifi-€:d-and-ne1-mere-than-¼-in:;-[-3--nnrrJuVi~----------r~ 
that specified.

13.3 For pipe ordered to random lengths, the lengths and 
variations shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and 
purchaser.
