TABLE A1.12 Thickness Tolerances of Cold-Rolled Sheet (All 
Designatlons)A -25-mm Minimum Edge Distance 
Norn I-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less 
than 25 mm from a side edge. 
Norn 2-Widths up to and including 300 mm in this table apply to 
widths produced by slitting from wider sheet. 
Norn 3-Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be 
constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 
0.188 in. [4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the 
anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 
in. [2.55 mm]. Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness 
measurements. 
Norn 4--This table was constructed by multiplying the values in the 
standard table by 0.50 and rounding to 2 decimal places using standard 
ASTM practice. 
Norn 5-The thickness of material <50 mm wide shall be measured at 
mid-width.

8 The specified thickness range captions apply independent of whether the 
ordered thickness is stated as a nominal or minimum. 
c The tolerances provided in the table are based on minimum thickness (tolerance 
over, no tolerance under). For nominal thickness, the tolerance is divided equally 
over and under.
