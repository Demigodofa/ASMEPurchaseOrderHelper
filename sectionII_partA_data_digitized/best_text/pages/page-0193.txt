packaging and level of packing required, if other than as 
specified or if MIL-STD-163 applies (see 22.1), and 
3 .1.18 Packaging and package marking, if desired ( see 
23.1). 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel for both seamless and welded pipe shall be 
made by one or more of the following processes: open-hearth, 
electric-furnace, or basic-oxygen. 
4.2 If steels of different grades are sequentially strand cast, 
identification of the resultant transition material is required. 
The steel producer shall remove the transition material by any 
established procedure that positively separates the grades. 
4.3 The weld seam of electric-resistance welded pipe in 
Grade B shall be heat treated after welding to a minimum of 
1000 °F [540 °C] so that no untempered martensite remains, or 
otherwise processed in such a manner that no untempered 
martensite remains. 
4.4 When pipe is cold expanded, the amount of expansion 
shall not exceed 1 ½ % of the specified outside diameter of the 
pipe. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition given in Table 1 and the chemical 
analysis shall be in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, 
and Terminology A751. 
141 
6. Product Analysis 
6.1 The purchaser is permitted to perform an analysis of two 
pipes from each lot of 500 lengths, or fraction thereof. Samples 
for chemical analysis, except for spectrographic analysis, shall 
be taken in accordance with Practice E1806. The chemical 
composition thus deterrnined shall conform to the requirements 
given in Table 1.
