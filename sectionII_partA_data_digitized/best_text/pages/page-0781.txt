Norn 1-A typical ordering description follows: 1000 pieces Vs in. 
diameter x 4.0 in. long hex cap screw, Type 1, ASTM A449-XX, each 
with one finished hex nut ASTM A563, Grade DH. Each component 
mechanically zinc coated in accordance with B695, Class 5, Type Il. 
3.2 Suitable Nuts and Washers: 
3.2.1 Suitable nuts are covered in Specification A563. 
Unless otherwise specified, the grade and style of nut shall be 
as follows: 
Fastener Size and Surface Finish 
¼ to 1 1 /2 in., plain (or with a coating of insufficient 
thickness to require over-tapped nuts) 
Over 1 ½ to 3 in., plain (or with a coating of insuffi' 
cient thickness to require over-tapped nuts) • 
¼ to 3 in., zinc-coated (or with a coating thickness 
requiring over-tapped nuts) 
¼ to 3 in., Type 3 
Nut Grade and StyleA 
B, hex 
A, heavy hex 
DH, heavy hex 
C3, DH3, heavy hex 
A Nuts of other grades and styles having specified proof load stresses (Specifica­
tion A563, Table 3) greater than the specified grade and style of nut are suitable. 
3.2.2 Unless otherwise specified, washers ordered with 
fasteners shall be furnished to the requirements of Specification 
F436, Type 1 or Specification F436, Type 3. Washers for A449 
Type 3 fasteners shall conform to Specification F436 Type 3. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Heat Treatment: 
4.1.1 Type 1 fasteners produced from medium carbon steel 
shall be quenched in a liquid medium from the austenitizing 
temperature. 
4.1.2 Type 1 fasteners produced from medium carbon steel 
to which chromium, nickel, molybdenum, or boron were 
intentionally added, and Type 3 fasteners, shall be quenched in 
oil from the austenitizing temperature. 
4.1.3 Type 1 and Type 3 fasteners, regardless of the steel 
used, shall be tempered by reheating to not less than 800°F. 
4.2 Threading-Threads shall be rolled, cut, or ground. 
4.3 Secondary Processing-If any processing which can 
affect the mechanical properties of the fasteners is performed 
after the initial testing, the fasteners shall be retested for all 
specified mechanical properties affected by the reprocessing. 
5. Protective Coatings 
5.1 Zinc, Hot Dip, and Mechanically Deposited Requiring 
Over-tapped Nuts: 
5.1.1 When zinc-coated fasteners are required, the pur­
chaser shall specify the zinc-coating process, such as, hot-dip, 
mechanically deposited, or no preference. 
5.1.2 When hot dip is specified, the fasteners shall be zinc 
coated by the hot-dip process in accordance with the require­
ments of Specification F2329. 
5.1.3 When mechanically deposited is specified, the fasten­
ers shall be zinc coated by the mechanical deposition process 
in accordance with the requirements of Class 55 of Specifica­
tion B695. 
5.1.4 When no preference is specified, the supplier may 
furnish either a hot-dip zinc coating in accordance with 
Specification F2329, or a mechanically deposited zinc coating 
in accordance with Specification B695, Class 55. All 
mating components shall be coated by the same zinc 
coating process, and the suppliers' option shall be limited to 
one process per item with no mixed processes in a lot. 
Norn 2-When the intended application requires that assembled 
tension exceeds 50 % of minimum bolt or stud proof load, an anti-galling 
lubricant may be needed. Application of such a lubricant to nuts and a test 
of the lubricant efficiency are provided in Supplementary Requirement S 1 
of Specification A563 and should be specified when required. 
731 
5.2 Other Coatings: 
5.2.1 When other coatings are required, the purchaser shall 
specify the coating specification, including the classification 
codes or grade numbers to identify the coating material, 
thickness, supplemental treatments, or other requirements to 
define the coating. The fasteners shall be coated in accordance 
with and conform to the specified coating specification. 
5.2.2 When a specification does not apply, the purchaser 
shall specify the desired coating, coating thickness, supplemen­
tal treatments, or other requirements to define the coating. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 Type 1 fasteners shall be plain carbon steel, carbon 
boron steel, alloy steel, or alloy boron steels, at the manufac­
turers option, conforming to the requirements in Table 1. 
6.2 Type 3 fasteners shall be weathering steel and shall 
conform to one of the chemical compositions specified in Table 
2. The selection of the chemical composition, A, B, C, D, E or 
F, shall be a the option of the manufacuturer. See Guide G 101 
for methods of estimating the atmospheric corrosion resistance 
of low alloy steel. 
6.3 Product analyses made on finished fasteners represent­
ing each lot shall conform to the product analysis requirements 
specified in Table 1 or Table 2, as applicable. 
6.4 Heats of steel to which bismuth, selenium, tellurium, or 
lead has been intentionally added shall not be permitted for 
bolts. Compliance shall be based on certification that heats of 
steel having any of the listed elements intentionally added were 
not used. 
6.5 Chemical analyses shall be performed in accordance 
with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751.
