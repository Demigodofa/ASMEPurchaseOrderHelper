TABLE S27.1 Permitted Variations From a Fla.t Surface for As-Rolled or Normalized Carbon Steel Plates Ordered to Half-Standard 
Flatness 
Norn I-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Along the Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and the permitted 
variation from a flat surface along the length shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 12 ft in length, or in any 12 ft 
of longer plates. 
NOTE 2-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Across the Width-The permitted variation from a flat surface across the width shall not exceed the 
tabular amount for the specified width. 
NOTE 3-When the longer dimension is under 36 in., the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed ¼ in. in each direction. When the 
longer dimension is from 36 to 72 in., incl, the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount for the specified width, 
but in no case less than ¼ in. 
Norn 4-The permitted variations given in this table apply to plates that have a minimum specified tensile strength not over 60 ksi or comparable 
chemistry or hardness. For plates specified to a higher minimum tensile strength or compatible chemistry or hardness, the permitted variations are 1 ½ 
times the amounts in this table. 
Norn 5-This table and these notes cover the permitted variations from a flat surface for circular and sketch plates, based upon the maximum 
dimensions of such plates. 
Norn 6-Permitted variations in waviness do not apply. 
Norn 7-Plates must be in a horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured.

TABLE S27.2 Permitted Variations From a Flat Surface for As-Rolled or Normalized Carbon Steel Plates Ordered to Half-Standard 
Flatness 
Norn I-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Along the Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and the permitted 
variation from a flat surface along the length shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 3700 mm in length, or in any 
3700 mm of longer plates. 
Norn 2-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Across the Width-The permitted variation from a flat surface across the width shall not exceed the 
tabular amount for the specified width. 
Norn 3-When the longer dimension is under 900 mm, the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed 6 mm in each direction. When the 
longer dimension is from 900 to 1800 mm, incl., the permitted flatness variation should not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount for the specified width, 
but in no case less than 6 mm. 
Norn 4-The permitted variations given in this table apply to plates that have a minimum specified tensile strength not over 415 MPa or comparable 
chemistry or hardness. For plates specified to a higher minimum tensile strength or compatible chemistry or hardness, the permitted variations are 1 ½ 
times the amounts in this table. 
Norn 5-This table and these notes cover the pennitted variations from a flat surface for circular and sketch plates, based upon the maximum 
dimensions of such plates. 
Norn 6-Permitted variations in waviness do not apply. 
NOTE 7-Plates must be in a horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured.
