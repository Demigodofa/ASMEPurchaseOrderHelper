SPECIFICATION FOR HOT-ROLLED 
AND COLD-FINISHED AGE-HARDENING 
STAINLESS STEEL BARS AND SHAPES 
SA-564/SA-564M cO 
INTSRNATIONAL 
Standards Worldwide 
[Identical with AS1M Specification A 564/A 564M-04(2009).] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers bars and shapes of age­
hardening stainless steels. Hot-finished or cold-finished 
rounds, squares, hexagons, bar shapes, angles, tees, and 
channels are included; these shapes may be produced by 
hot rolling, extruding, or forging. Billets or bars for reforg­
ing may be purchased to this specification. 
1.2 These steels are generally used for parts requiring 
corrosion resistance and high strength at room temperature, 
or at temperatures up to 600°F [315°C]; 700°F (370°C] 
for Type 632; 840°F [450°C] for Type UNS S46910. They 
are suitable for machining in the solution-annealed condi­
tion after which they may be age-hardened to the mechani­
cal properties specified in Section 7 without danger of 
cracking or distortion. Type XM-25 is machinable in the 
as-received fully heat treated condition. Type UNS S46910 
is suitable for machining in the solution-annealed, cold­
worked, and aged-hardened condition.

l.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI but are not limited to the following: 
(metric) units are to be regarded separately as standards; 3.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), 
within the text and tables, the SI units are shown in [brack- 3.1.2 Type or UNS designation (Table 1),
