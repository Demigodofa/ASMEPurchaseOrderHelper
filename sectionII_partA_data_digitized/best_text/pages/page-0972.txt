SA-516/SA-516M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Carbon Steel, for Moderate- and 
Lower-Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers carbon steel plates intended 
primarily for service in welded pressure vessels where im­
proved notch toughness is important. 
1.2 Plates under this specification are available in four 
grades having different strength levels as follows: 
Tensile Strength, Grade U.S. [SI] ksi [MPa] 
55 (380] 55-75 (380-515] 
60 (415] 60-80 [415-550] 
65 [450] 65-85 [450-585] 
70 [485] 70-90 [485-620] 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.4 For plates produced from coil and furnished without 
heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the additional 
requirements, including additional testing requirements and the 
reporting of additional test results of Specification A2O/A2OM 
apply. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development o] international Sfiiii<iaras;TJuide.iaiirrRecom~ 
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material supplied to this product specification shall 
conform to Specification A2O/A2OM, which outlines the test­
ing and retesting methods and procedures, permissible varia­
tions in dimensions and mass, quality and repair of defects, 
marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
where additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A2O/A2OM. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A2O/A2OM, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
3.4 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates 
- pl'00ueed· fr0m-e0il-means -plates-that-- have-been-cut-to 
individual lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or 
is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of 
coils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, 
leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, 
heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for 
shipment, and certification.
