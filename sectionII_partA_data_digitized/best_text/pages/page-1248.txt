LOtATION OP ACI ALLOY TYPES 
Norn 1-The approximate areas of microstructures to be expected at room temperature are indicated as follows: 
I-Martensite 
II-Martensite and untransformed austenite 
III-Ferrite plus martensite and untransformed austenite 
IV-Ferrite 
V-Ferrite plus austenite 
VI-Ferrite plus austenite plus sigma 
VII-Austenite 
NOTE 2-Carbides also may be present depending on carbon content and thermal history.

Xl. ALLOY DESIGNATIONS FOR CAST STAINLESS STEELS 
Xl.1 Cast stainless steels are usually specified on the basis 
of composition using the alloy designation system established 
by the Alloy Casting Institute (ACI). The ACI designations, for 
example, CF8M, have been adopted by ASTM and are pre­
ferred for cast alloys over the designations used by the 
American Iron and Steel Institute for similar wrought steels. 
Xl .2 This nomenclature system has served successfully to 
accommodate changes in old alloys and to designate new ones.

Xl.2.1 Service Classification Letter-The first letter of the 
cast stainless steel designation system identifies the intended 
service application of the alloy. The letter C indicates 
corrosion-resistant service, and the letter H indicates the 
heat-resistant service at and above 1200 °F [649 °C]. 
Xl.2.2 Ternary Diagram Location Letter-The second let­
ter indicates the approximate location of the nickel and 
chromium contents of the alloy grade on the FeCrNi ternary 
diagram shown in Fig. Xl.l. 
Xl.2.3 Carbon Content Number-For C service 
classifications, this single or dual-digit numeral represents the 
maximum carbon content in units of 0.01 %. For H service 
classifications, this number represents the midpoint of the 
range of carbon content in terms of 0.01 % with a ±0.05 % 
limit. 
Xl .2.4 Special Elements Letter-Additional letters follow­
ing the numeral represent special chemical elements in the 
alloy grade, such as M for molybdenum, C for columbium (Nb 
for niobium), Mn for manganese, S for silicon, N for nitrogen, 
Cu for copper, and W for tungsten. There are two exceptions: 
the letter A indicates "Controlled Ferrite," and the letter F 
indicates "Free Machining." 
Xl.3 In Fig. Xl.l, unlettered NiCr ranges are associated 
with the nearest lettered location. They may be the result of 
differences between corrosion and heat-resistant types or be­
cause of the influence of additional elements; for example, the 
precipitation hardening grade CB- 7Cu.
