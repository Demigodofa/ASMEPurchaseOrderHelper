5. Manufacture 
5.1 Bolting material shall be supplied hot-rolled or hot­
forged or cold-finished at the option of the producer. However, 
if desired by the purchaser, cold finishing may be specified. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 Bolting material ordered in the annealed condition shall 
have a structure suitable for machining. Such annealed material 
is not intended to be used without subsequent quenching and 
tempering as specified in 6.2. 
6.2 Bolting material ordered in the liquid-quenched and 
tempered condition shall be uniformly reheated from a tem­
perature below the cooling transformation range to the proper 
austenitizing temperature, quenched in a liquid medium under 
substantially uniform conditions, and then uniformly reheated 
for tempering. The minimum tempering temperature shall be 
850 °F [455 °C]. 
6.3 Bolting material that has been straightened after quench­
ing and tempering shall be stress relieved by reheating to a 
temperature not lower than 100 °F [55 °C] under the tempering 
temperature. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 Steels used for bolting materials shall conform to the 
chemical requirements prescribed in Table 1. 
8. Tensile Requirements 
8.1 Bolting material furnished in the annealed condition 
shall be capable of meeting the specified tensile properties for 
the class as specified in Table 2 when heat treated in accor­
dance with 6.2 and 6.3 (see Supplementary Requirement S4). 
8.2 Bolting material in the quenched and tempered or 
quenched, tempered and stress-relieved condition shall con­
form to properties shown in Table 2 for the specified class. 
9. Hardness Requirements 
9.1 The hardness shall be determined on the surface of the 
material after removal of decarburization. 
9.2 The hardness of bolting material in the annealed condi­
tion shall not be greater than 235 HBW. 
9.3 The hardness of bolting material in the quenched and 
tempered or quenched, tempered and stress-relieved condition 
shall be within the limits in Table 2 for the specified class. 
10. Impact Requirements 
10.1 Annealed bolting material after proper heat treatment 
shall be capable of meeting the impact requirements in Table 2 
or of Supplementary Requirement S8, if so specified (see 
Supplementary Requirement S4). 
10.2 Bolting material in the quenched and tempered or 
quenched, tempered, and stress-relieved condition shall con­
form to the impact requirements in Table 2, or of Supplemen­
tary Requirement S8 if so specified. 
10.3 The percent of shear (ductility or fibrous) fracture shall 
be computed. The computed value shall be recorded for all 
impact specimens. 
10.4 The amount of lateral expansion shall be measured. 
The measured value shall be recorded for all impact specimens. 
10.5 The percent shear and the amount of lateral expansion 
shall be reported for information purposes (see 16.1). 
11. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
11.1 Bolting material shall be uniform in quality and free of 
defects that would be detrimental to the intended service. If 
magnetic particle inspection for such defects is desired, 
Supplementary Requirement S6 should be specified. 
11.2 Su,face Quality-Bolting material shall be free of 
seams, laps, cracks, or other defects that are not removable 
within the machining cleanup allowance specified in Table 3.
