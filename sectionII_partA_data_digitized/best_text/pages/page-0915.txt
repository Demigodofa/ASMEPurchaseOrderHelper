3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 bars, n-straight lengths that are produced by process­
ing that includes hot deformation, such as rolling, forging, or 
extrusion; the permitted cross-sections include round, 
rectangular, and complex shapes; shall include shapes with all 
dimensions under 5 in. [125 mm]; shall include hot-rolled flats 
with width of 10 in. [250 mm] or less, and with thickness 
0.125 in. [3.00 mm] or greater; shall include flats with width of 
10 in. [250 mm] or less, and with thickness 0.125 in. [3.00 mm] 
or greater, cut from strip or plate provided that the long 
direction of the cut bar is parallel to the final rolling direction 
of the strip or plate. 
3.1.1.1 Discussion-All cold-reduced flat material with 
thickness less than 0.1875 in. [5.00 mm] and width 0.375 in. 
[9.50 mm] and over is classified as strip. 
3.1.2 billets, n-semi-finished products, typically produced 
by rolling, forging, or continuous casting, that require subse­
quent hot working by rolling, forging, or extrusion; typically 
have a cross-section area of 36 in. 2 [230 cm 2 ] or less and shape 
that is square or rectangular with width less than twice the 
thickness; rectangular cross sections with width equal to or 
greater than twice the thickness are classified as slabs or sheet 
bars. 
3.1.3 blooms, n-semi-finished products, typically produced 
by rolling or continuous casting, that require subsequent hot 
working by rolling or forging; typically have a cross section 
area of greater than 36 in.2 [230 cm 2 ] and shape that is square 
or rectangular with width less than twice the thickness; 
rectangular cross sections with width equal to or greater than 
twice the thickness are classified as slabs or sheet bars. 
3.1.4 condition, n-identification of the final step or steps 
thermomechanical processing as required to describe the met­
allurgical state of the material as delivered (examples include 
hot-worked; hot-worked and annealed; hot-worked, annealed, 
and cold-worked for increased mechanical properties; and 
hot-worked, quenched, and tempered). 
3.1.5 dead lengths or exact lengths, n-bars, typically 
hot-sheared, hot-sawed, or machine-cut after machine­
straightening, meeting the permitted variations in length as 
listed in the tolerance tables of this specification. 
3.1.6 finish, n-description of the surface finish and appli­
cable dimensional tolerances of the product as delivered, most 
typically by identification of the process applied to the product, 
and identification of the applicable category of product dimen­
sional tolerances; examples of finishing operations include 
blasting, pickling, rough turning, machine straightening, cen­
terless grinding, polishing, and light cold drawing for surface 
finish but not for increased mechanical properties; see also 
8.1.1 for hot-finished bars and 8.1.3 for cold~finished bars. 
815 
3.1.7 forgings, n-parts, including bars, billets, semi­
finished products, or complex shapes, produced by hot me­
chanical working using hammers, presses, or forging ma­
chines. 
3.1.8 multiple lengths, n-lengths that are specified as 
containing a predetermined number of units of length associ­
ated with production of a particular part, commonly including 
an allowance of 1/4 in. [6.5 mm] per unit for cutting to insure 
obtaining the required number of pieces. 
3.1.9 random lengths, n-a length range not less than 24 in. 
[1 m]; for example, 10 to 12 ft [3 to 4 m], 14 to 17 ft [4 to 5 rn], 
or 15 to 20 ft [5 to 6 m]. 
3.1.10 shapes, n-bar having a cross section other than 
circular, rectangular, or hexagonal. 
3.1.11 slabs or sheet bars, n-products, typically produced 
by blooming, slabbing, or sheet bar mills or by continuous 
casting, that are shipped without further hot working to be 
further processed into plate, sheet, or strip; it is permitted to 
heat treat, cut to shape, or surface condition a slab or sheet bar. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements to be considered include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces),
