ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-965 /SA-965M 
marking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi­
tional supplementary requirements. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, the 
requirements of this specification shall prevail. 
3.4 If the forgings are intended for use under the ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code at temperatures exceeding 
1000 °F [540 °C], then use Supplementary Requirement S7. 
Grain size requirements for service exceeding 1000 °F 
[540 °C] should be specified unless the required grade has the 
suffix "H." 
4. Melting and Forging 
4.1 In addition to the melting and forging requirements of 
Specification A 788/ A 788M, which may include Supplemen­
tary Requirement S8, the following condition applies: 
4.1.1 A sufficient discard shall be made to secure freedom 
from injurious pipe and undue segregation. 
5. Machining 
5.1 Forged pressure vessels for steam power service shall 
have the inner surface machined or ground. Unfired pressure 
vessels shall have the inner surfaces sufficiently free of scale to 
permit inspection. 
5.2 When rough machining is pe1formed, it may be done 
either before or after heat treatment. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 Forgings shall be furnished in the solution treated 
condition. On completion of forging operations, the forgings 
shall be solution annealed and quenched in water, oil, or a 
polymer water solution. Direct quenching after completion of 
forging without subsequent reheating to the temperatures 
prescribed in 6.2 - 6.12 is not permissible. 
6.2 For Grades F304H, F309H, F310H, F316H, F321H, 
F347H, and F348H, the minimum solution annealing tempera­
ture shall be 1925 °F [1050 °C]. 
6.3 Grade FXM-11 shall be solution annealed at a minimum 
of 1950 °F [1065 °C]. 
6.4 Grade F20 shall be solution annealed in the temperature 
range of 1700 °F to 1850 °F [925 °C to 1010 °C]. 
6.5 Grade F46 shall be solution annealed in the temperature 
range of 2010 °F to 2140 °F [1100 °C to 1170 °C]. 
6.6 Grade F62 shall be solution annealed at a minimum of 
2025 °F [1107 °C]. 
6.7 Grade F904L shall be solution annealed in the tempera­
ture range of 1920 °F to 2100 °F [1050 °C to 1150 °C]. 
6.8 Grade F700 shall be solution annealed in the tempera­
ture range of 2025 °F to 2100 °F [1107 °C to 1150 °C]. 
6.9 Grades FNIC and Fl925 shall be solution annealed in 
the temperature range of 1800 °F to 1900 °F [985 °C to 
1040 °C]. 
6.10 Grades FNIClO and FNICll shall be solution annealed 
in the temperature range of 2100 °F to 2150 °F [1150 °C to 
1180 °C]. 
6.11 Grade Fl925N shall be solution annealed at a mini­
mum of 2150 °F [1180 °C]. 
6.12 The remaining grades in Table 1 shall be solution 
annealed at a minimum temperature of 1900 °F [1040 °C]. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam­
pling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall 
comply with Table 1. 
7 .2 Product Analysis-The manufacturer shall use the prod­
uct analysis provision of Specification A 788/ A 788M to obtain 
a product analysis from a forging representing each heat or 
multiple heat. The product analysis tolerances for carbon shall 
not apply, and the carbon requirements shall conform to Table 
1.

8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 Requirements-The material shall conform to the re­
quirements for mechanical properties prescribed in Table 2 or, 
if applicable, Supplementary Requirement S2. The largest 
obtainable tension test specimen as specified in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370 or Test Methods A1058 shall be used. 
8.2 Number of Tests-The number and location of tests are 
based on the heat-treated weight of the forging(s) from the 
same heat, solution annealed in the same furnace charge. 
8.2.1 For forgings weighing less than 5000 lb [2250 kg] as 
heat treated, one tension test shall be required on the basis of 
one test per heat in each heat treatment load. This test shall be 
taken from a prolongation of one of the forgings. Use of a
