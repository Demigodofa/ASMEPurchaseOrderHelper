SA-691/SA-691M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The finished pipe shall be free of injurious defects and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. This requirement is to mean 
the same as the identical requirement that appears in Specifi­
cation A20/A20M with respect to steel plate surface finish. 
13. Product Marking 
13.1 The marking shall be stenciled using a suitable heat­
resistant paint or metal stamped using low-stress stamps. Wall 
thicknesses under 0.500 in. [13 mm] shall not be metal stamped 
without prior approval. The purchaser may specify that mate­
rial 0.500 in. [13 mm] and over shall not be metal stamped. 
13.2 In addition to the marking provision of Specification 
A530/A530M, the class marking in accordance with 1.3.3 shall 
follow the grade marking, for example, 3CR-33. 
13.3 A387/A387M Grade 91 shall additionally be marked 
with the appropriate Type, 1 or 2, when applicable based on the 
ordered specification. 
13.4 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 13.1, 
13.2, and 13.3, bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental 
identification method. The purchaser may specify in the order 
a specific bar coding system to be used. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall be applied only when specified by 
the purchaser in the inquiry, contract, or order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be 
agreed upon in writing by the manufacturer and purchaser, Supplementary requirements shall in no 
way negate any requirement of the specification itself. 
Sl. Tension and Bend Tests 
Sl.1 Tension tests in accordance with 8.1 and bend tests in 
accordance with 8.2 shall be made on specimens representing 
each length of pipe. 
S2. Charpy V-Notch Test (for pipe with nominal wall thick­
ness of½ in. [13 mm] and greater) 
S2. l Requirements-The acceptable test energies shall be 
as shown in Table Al.15 of Specification A20/A20M for the 
applicable plate specification unless otherwise stated in the 
order. As an alternative, the test temperature may be 10 °F [-12 
oq, 
S2.2 Number of Specimens-Each test shall consist of at 
least three specimens. 
S2.2.1 One base-metal test shall be made from one pipe 
length per heat, per heat-treat charge, and per nominal wall 
thickness. 
S2.2.2 One weld-metal and one heat-affected zone (HAZ) 
metal test shall be made in accordance with NB 4335 of 
Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
S2.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation: 
S2.3.1 Base-metal specimens of stress-relieved, normalized, 
and normalized and tempered pipe shall be taken in accordance 
with the provisions for tension specimens in the body of this 
specification. 
S2.3.2 Base-metal specimens of quenched and tempered 
pipe shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of NB 
2225 of Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code. 
S3. Hardness Tests 
S3.1 Hardness determination shall be made on both ends of 
each length of pipe to the parent metal, weld, and the 
heat-affected zone and must meet the hardness requirements in 
Table 1. 
S4. Product Analysis 
S4.1 Product analysis shall be made on each length of pipe. 
Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical require­
ments prescribed in the applicable specification listed in Table 
1 shall be rejected. 
SS. Metallography 
S5.1 The manufacturer shall furnish one photomicrograph 
to show the microstructure at lOOx magnification of the weld 
metal or base metal of the pipe in the as-finished condition. The 
purchaser shall state in the order: the material, base metal or 
weld, and the number and locations of tests to be made. This 
test is for information only. 
S6. Magnetic Particle Examination of Base Metal 
S6.1 All accessible surfaces of the pipe shall be examined in 
accordance with Practice E709. Accessible is defined as: All 
outside surfaces, all inside surfaces of pipe 24 in. [600 mm] in 
diameter and greater, and inside surfaces of pipe less than 24 
in. [600 mm] in diameter for a distance of one pipe diameter 
from the ends. 
S6.2 Butt-weld end preparations are to be completely 
• magnetic-particle examined in accordance with Practice E709. 
S6.3 Acceptance Standards, shall be by agreement between 
the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
S7. Magnetic Particle Examinations of Weld Metal 
S7 .1 All accessible welds shall be examined in accordance 
with Practice E709. Accessible is defined as: All outside 
surfaces, all inside surfaces of pipe 24 in. [600 mm] in diameter 
and greater, and inside surfaces of pipe less than 24 in. [600 
mm] in diameter for a distance of one pipe diameter from the 
ends. 
S7 .2 Butt-weld end preparations are to be completely 
magnetic-particle examined in accordance with Practice E709.
