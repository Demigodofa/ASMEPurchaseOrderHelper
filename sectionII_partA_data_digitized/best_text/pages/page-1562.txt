X2.RELATEDISOSTANDARDS 
X2.1 The ISO standards listed below may be reviewed for 
comparison with this ASTM standard. The relationship be­
tween the standards may only be approximate; therefore, the 
respective standards should be consulted for actual require­
ments. Those who use these documents must determine which 
specifications address their needs. 
X2.1.1 ISO 3574 Cold-Reduced Carbon Steel Sheet of 
Commercial and Drawing Qualities. 
X2.1.2 ISO 4997 Cold-Reduced Steel Sheet of Structural 
Quality. 
X2.1.3 ISO 13887 Cold-Reduced Steel Sheet of Higher 
Strength with Improved Formability. 
X3. HARDNESS PROPERTIES 
X3.l See Table X3.1 for typical hardness property values. 
TABLE X3.1 Typical Hardness Values 
NOTE 1-The hardness values shown are at the time of shipment. 
NOTE 2-Test for hardness shall be conducted in accordance with the 
requirements of Test Methods El 8. 
Norn 3-The hardness values are Rockwell B scale as measured or 
converted from the appropriate Rockwell scales. 
Norn 4--The typical hardness values apply to the full range of steel 
sheet thickness. Hardness tends to increase as the steel sheet thickness 
decreases. 
NOTE 5-Hardness testing is commonly used to assess the relative 
formability of various designations of uncoated steel sheet. This assess­
ment done by many users is recognized to be only an approximation of the 
relative formability and therefore cannot be used as a specification 
requirement.
