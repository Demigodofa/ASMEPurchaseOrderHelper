ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-859/SA-859M (ASTM A859/A859M) 
description of the forging and the method of selecting test 
location (see 6.3). When appropriate, the areas of significant 
loading in the forging shall be designated. 
3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out­
lines additional ordering information, manufacturing 
requirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, 
marking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi­
tional supplementary requirements. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, the 
requirements of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 Melting Practice-The steel shall be made to a killed, 
fine austenitic grain size, practice. 
4.1.1 Vacuum degassing in accordance with Specification 
A788/A788M is highly recommended. 
4.2 Heat Treatment: 
4.2.1 Normalizing may, at the manufacturer's option, pre­
cede the prescribed heat treatment cycle. 
4.2.2 Grade A Class 1 forgings shall be normalized at a 
temperature in the range from 1600 to 1725 °F [870 to 940 °C] 
and then precipitation hardened in the range from 1000 to 
1225 °F [540 to 665 °C] for a time to be determined by the 
material manufacturer. 
4.2.3 Grade A Class 2 forgings shall be liquid quenched 
from a temperature in the range from 1600 to 1725 °F [870 to 
940 °C] and then precipitation hardened in the range from 1000 
to 1225 °F [540 to 665 °C] for a time to be determined by the 
material manufacturer. 
4.2.4 Grade B forgings shall be double quenched and 
tempered (liquid quenched twice) by austenitizing twice at a 
temperature in the range of 1600 to 1725 °F [870 to 940 °C], 
and then precipitation hardened at a temperature in the range of 
1000 to 1300 °F [540 to 700 °C] for a time to be determined by 
the manufacturer. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam­
pling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall 
comply with Table 1. 
5.2 Product Analysis-The purchaser may use the product 
analysis provision of Specification A788/A788M to obtain a 
product analysis from a forging representing each heat or 
multiple heat. 
6. Mechanical Requirements 
6.1 Tensile Requirements;_The forgings, as represented by 
the tension test specimens, shall conform to the requirements 
of Table 2. The largest obtainable tension test specimen as 
specified in Test Methods and Definitions A370 shall be used. 
6.2 Notch Toughness Requirements: 
6.2.1 For Grade A, Class 1 or 2 forgings, unless Supple­
mentary Requirement S6 is specified, the Charpy impact test 
results shall conform to the requirements of Table 3. One set of 
three specimens shall be removed from each specimen location 
as specified in 6.3. The supplier may select a test temperature 
colder than that specified in the order, but in any case, the 
actual test temperature shall be reported with the test results. 
6.2.2 For Grade B forgings two sets of Charpy impact 
specimens shall be removed from each test specimen location 
as specified in and shall conform to the requirements of Table 
3. 
6.2.3 Full-size, 10 by 10 mm, Charpy V-notch specimens 
shall be used unless the material thickness or configuration 
makes it impossible to obtain full-size specimens. If the use of 
sub-size specimens is necessary, the largest standard sub-size 
specimen it is possible to obtain shall be used. 
6.2.4 The acceptance values for sub-size specimens shall be 
reduced in direct ratio to the reduction of specimen width. 
6.3 Sampling-The longitudinal axis and the mid-length of 
tension and impact test specimens shall be positioned in 
accordance with one of the following methods as specified by 
the purchaser:
