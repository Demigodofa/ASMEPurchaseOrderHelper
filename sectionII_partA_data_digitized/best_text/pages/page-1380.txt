SA-813/SA-813M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
8.1.1 Specified Diameter-The outside diameter shall be 
based on circumferential measurement and shall not exceed the 
tolerances stated as follows: 
8.1.1.1 For sizes up to and including NPS 1 ¼, ±0.010 in. 
[±0.25 mm], 
8.1.1.2 For sizes NPS 1 ½ up to and including NPS 6, 
±0.020 in. [±0.5 mm], 
8.1.1.3 For sizes NPS 8 up to and including NPS 18, 
±0.030 in. [±0.75 mm], 
8.1.1.4 For sizes NPS 20 up to and including NPS 24, 
±0.040 in. [± 1 mm], and 
8.1.1.5 For sizes NPS 30, ±0.050 in. [±1.25 mm]. 
8.1.1.6 Outside diameter tolerances closer than shown 
above may be obtained by agreement between the pipe 
manufacturer and purchaser. 
8.1.2 Out-of-Roundness-The difference.between the major 
and the minor outside diameter shall not be more than 1.5 % of 
the specified outside diameter. 
8.1.3 Alignment (Camber)-Using a 10-ft [3.0-m] straight­
edge placed so that both ends are in contact with the pipe, the 
camber shall not be more than 3/26 in. [4.8 mm]. 
8.1.4 Thickness-The wall thickness at any point in the pipe 
excluding the weld, shall not be more than 12 % under or over 
the nominal thickness for wall thickness less than 0.188 in. 
[4.8 mm] and not more than 0.030 in. [0.8 mm] under or over 
the nominal thickness for wall thickness 0.188 in. [4.8 mm] 
and greater. Weld reinforcement not to exceed 20 % of the wall 
thickness is permitted on each of the inside and outside 
surfaces of the pipe. 
9. Lengths 
9.1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following 
regular practice: 
9.1.1 Unless otherwise agreed upon, all sizes up to and 
including NPS 8 are available in a length up to 24 ft (Note 2) 
with the permissible range of 15 to 24 ft (Note 2). Short lengths 
are acceptable and the number and minimum length shall be 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
NoTE 2-The value(s) applies when the inch-pound designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase. When the "M" designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase, the corresponding metric value( s) 
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
9.1.2 If definite cut lengths are desired, the lengths required 
shall be specified in the order. No pipe shall be under the 
specified length and not more than ¼ in. [6 mm] over that 
specified. 
10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
10.1 The finished pipes shall be free of injurious imperfec­
tions and shall have a workmanlike finish. Minor imperfections 
may be removed by grinding, provided the wall thicknesses are 
not decreased to less than that permitted in Section 8. 
11. Examination of Double-Welded Pipe 
11.1 Both ends of each double-welded (Class DW) pipe 
shall be visually examined to determine that complete fusion 
was attained between the two welds. In lieu of examining the 
ends of the pipe, this examination may be performed on 
cropped ends removed from both ends of each double welded 
pipe. 
12. Mechanical Tests Required 
12.l Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One tension 
test shall be made on a specimen for lots of not more than 100 
pipes. Tension tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes 
for lots of more than 100 pipes. Pipe size greater than NPS 6 
shall be tested using the transverse tension test with the weld 
centered in the gauge length of the test specimen. Test 
specimens shall be taken from the pipe or test plates of the 
sanie material as the pipe, the test plates being attached to the 
end of the cylinder and welded as prolongation of the pipe 
longitudinal weld seam. 
NoTE 3-The term lot, for mechanical tests, applies to all pipe of the 
same nominal size and wall thickness (or schedule) which is produced 
from the same heat of steel and subjected to the same finishing treatment: 
(J) in a continuous heat-treatment furnace, or (2) in a batch-type 
heat-treatment furnace, equipped with recording pyrometers and automati­
cally controlled within a 50 °F [30 °C] range, the larger of: (a) each 200 
ft [60 m] or fraction thereof or (b) that pipe heat treated in the same batch 
furnace charge. 
12.2 Flattening Test-For material heat treated in a batch­
type furnace, flattening tests shall be made on 5 % of the pipe 
from each heat-treated lot. For material heat treated by the 
continuous process, this test shall be made on a sufficient 
number of pipe to constitute 5 % of the lot, but in no case less 
than two lengths of pipe. 
12.2.1 For pipe where the diameter equals or exceeds NPS 
10, a transverse-guided face bend test of the weld may be 
conducted instead of a flattening test in accordance with the 
method outlined in the steel tubular product supplement of Test 
Methods and Definitions A370. The ductility of the weld shall 
be considered acceptable when there is no evidence of cracks 
in the weld or between the weld and the base metal after 
bending. Test specimens from 5 % of the lot shall be taken 
from the pipe or test plates of the same material as the pipe, the 
test plates being attached to the end of the cylinder and welded 
as a prolongati~n of the pipe longitudinal seam. 
13. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
13.1 Each pipe shall be subjected to the nondestructive 
electric test or the hydrostatic test. The type of test to be used 
shall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order. 
13.2 The hydrostatic test shall be in accordance with Speci­
fication A999/ A999M. 
13.3 Nondestructive Examination-Each pipe shall be ex­
amined with a nondestructive test in accordance with Practice 
E213, or E426. Unless specifically called out by the purchaser, 
the selection of the nondestructive electric test will be at the 
option of the manufacturer. The range of pipe sizes that may be 
examined by each method shall be subject to the limitations in 
the scope of the respective practices.
