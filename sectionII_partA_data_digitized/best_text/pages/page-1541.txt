3. Materials and Manufacture 
3.1 The steel shall be made by a suitable steelmaking 
process. 
3.2 If secondary melting, such as electroslag remelting or 
vacuum remelting, is used, the heat shall be defined as all of the 
ingots remelted from a single primary heat. 
3.3 If steels of different grades are sequentially strand cast, 
the resultant transition material shall be removed using an 
established procedure that positively separates the grades. 
3.4 If a specific type of melting is required by the purchaser, 
it shall be specified in the purchase order.
