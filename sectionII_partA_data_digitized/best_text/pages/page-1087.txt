TABLE 15 Thickness Tolerances for Cold-Rolled Sheet (All Designations)A -1-in. Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut Lengths) 
NoTE I-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than 1 in. from a side edge. 
NoTE 2-Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in. 
[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm). 
Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements. 
NoTE 3-The thickness of material <2 in. wide shall be measured at mid-width.

c The tolerances provided in the table are based on minimum thickness (tolerance over, no tolerance under). For nominal thickness, the tolerance is divided equally over 
and under.

adequate flattening measures are performed to remove all undesirable 
flatness conditions, including, but not limited to, coil set.

fails to meet the specification requirements and the failure is 
not related to the conditions described in 11.1.1.1 - 11.1.1.3, 
but the results are within 2 ksi [14 MPa] of the required yield 
strength, within 2 ksi [14 MPa] of the required tensile strength, 
or within 2 percentage points of the required elongation, one 
retest shall be permitted to replace the failing test.
