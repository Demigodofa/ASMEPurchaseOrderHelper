A 5 in. [125 mm] minimum length will be 
used. This length may be increased at the 
option of the foundry to accommodate addi­
tional test specimens (see Note ll. 
Use of and size of end taper is at the option

A ½ in. [13 mm] radius will be used between 
the legs. 
The tensile, bend, and impact specimens will 
be taken from the lower portion of the leg 
(see Note 2). 
The number of legs is at the option of the foundry 
providing they are equi-spaced according to

Riser Design

[213] 
The length of the riser at the base will be the 
same as the top length of the leg. The 
length of the riser at the top therefore 
depends on the amount of taper added to 
the riser. 
The width of the riser at the base of a multi­
ple-leg coupon shall be n <2¼> [57 mm] -
% [16 mmJ where n equals the number of 
legs attached to the coupon. The width of 
the riser at the top is therefore dependent 
on the amount of taper added to the riser. 
Use of and size is at the option of the foundry. 
The minimum height of the riser shall be 2 in. 
[51 mm]. The maximum height is at the 
option of the foundry for the following rea­
sons: (al many risers are cast open. (bl differ­
ent compositions may require variation in 
risering for soundness. (cl different pouring 
temperatures may require variation in ris­
ering for soundness. 
NoTE 1 - Test Coupons for Large and Heavy Steel Castings: The test coupons in Fig. 1 are to be used for large and heavy steel castings. 
However, at the option of the foundry the cross-sectional area and length of the standard coupon may be increased as desired. 
NOTE 2 - Bend Specimen: If a bend specimen is required, an alternate design (as shown by dotted lines in Fig. 1) is indicated.
