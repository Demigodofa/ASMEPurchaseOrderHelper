INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless Cold-Drawn Carbon Steel Feedwater Heater 
Tubes 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A556/A556M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editodal change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
seamless cold-drawn carbon steel tubes including bending into 
the form of U-tubes, if specified, for use in tubular feedwater 
heaters. 
1.2 The tubing sizes covered shall be 5/s to 1 ¼-in. [15.9 to 
31.8-mm] outside diameter, inclusive, with minimnm wall 
thicknesses equal to or greater than 0.045 in. [l. l mm]. 
1.3 Optional supplementary requirements are provided, and 
when desired, shall be stated in the order. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as the standard. Within the text, 
the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
l .5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for material under this specification should 
include the following as required to describe the desired 
material adequately: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of pieces), 
3.1.2 Name of material (seamless steel tubing), 
3.1.3 Dimensions (outside diameter and minimum wall 
thickness), 
3.1.4 Length (specific or random), 
3.1.5 Manufacture (cold drawn), 
3.1.6 Grade (chemical composition), 
3.1.7 Optional requirements, 
3.1.8 Bending Requirements-If order specifies tubes to be 
bent, the design of the U-tubes shall accompany the order. 
Purchaser must specify if stress-relief anneal of the U-bends is 
required, 
3.1.9 Test report required (see Certification Section of 
Specification A450/ A450M), 
3 .1.10 Specification number, and 
3 .1.11 Special requirements and any supplementary require­
ments selected. 
_ 4. General Reqmrement_g_ 
4.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the applicable requirements of the current edition of the 
Specification A450/A450M, unless otherwise provided herein. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 Manufacture-Tubes shall be made by the seamless 
process and shall be cold drawn. 
5.2 Heat Treatment: 
5.2.1 Cold-drawn tubes shall be heat treated after the final 
cold-draw pass at a temperature of 1200°F [640°C] or higher to 
ensure ductility satisfactory for rolling into tube sheets and to 
meet mechanical properties as specified. 
5.2.2 If stress-relief anneal of the U-bends is specified, the 
anneal shall consist of heating the bent portion within a range 
of 1100 to 1200°F [585 to 640°C].
