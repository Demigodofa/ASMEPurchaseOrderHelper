S26. Low-Sulfur Steels 
S26.l The steel shall be made to 0.010 % sulfur maximum. 
Lower sulfur levels and sulfide shape control practices can be 
specified by agreement between the manufacturer or processor 
and the purchaser. 
S27. Restrictive Plate Flatness 
S27.l Carbon steel plates, as-rolled or normalized, shall 
conform to the permissible restrictive variations from flatness 
given in Table S27.l or Table S27.2. 
S27.2 High-strength low-alloy steel plates, as-rolled or 
normalized, shall conform to the permissible restrictive varia­
tions from flatness given in Table S27.3 or Table S27.4. 
S28. Heat Treatment in the Working Zone of a Surveyed 
Furnace 
S28. l Plates shall be heat treated in the working zone of a 
furnace that has been surveyed in accordance with Test Method 
A991/A991M, provided that such working zone was estab­
lished using a variation of 25°F [15°C] or less from the furnace 
set point. 
S28.2 The test report shall indicate that S28 applies.

TABLE S27.1 Permissible Variations from Flatness for Carbon Steel Plates As-Rolled or Normalized Ordered to Restrictive Flatness 
N om I-Flatness Variations for Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and variation in flatness along the length shall not 
exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 12 ft in length, or in any 12 ft of longer plates. 
Norn 2-Flatness Variations for Width-The flatness variation across the width shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width. 
Norn 3-When the longer dimension is under 36 in., the variation in flatness along the length and across the width shall not exceed ¼ in. in each 
direction. When the longer dimension is from 36 to 72 in., inclusive, the permissible flatness vaiiation shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount for 
the specified width, but in no case less than ¼ in. 
Norn 4-The variations given in this table apply to plates that have a minimum specified tensile strength not over 60 ksi or comparable chemistry or 
hai·dness. For plates specified to a higher minimum tensile strength or compai·able chemistry or hardness, the permissible variations are I½ times the 
amounts shown in the table below. 
Norn 5-This table ai1d these notes cover the flatness vadations of circular and sketch plates based on the maximum dimensions of those plates. 
Norn 6-Waviness tolerances for rectangular plates, universal mill plates, and circular and sketch plates do not apply. 
Norn 7-A "Z" indicates that there is no published restricted value for the size. 
Norn 8-Plates shall be in a horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured.
