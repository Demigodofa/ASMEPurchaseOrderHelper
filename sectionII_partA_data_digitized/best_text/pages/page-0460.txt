SA-276 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Stainless Steel Bars and Shapes 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers hot-finished or cold-finished 
bars except bars for reforging (Note 1). It includes rounds, 
squares, and hexagons, and hot-rolled or extruded shapes, such 
as angles, tees, and channels in the more commonly used types 
of stainless steels. The free-machining types (Note 2) for 
general corrosion resistance and high-temperature service are 
covered in a separate specification. 
NoTE 1-For bars for reforging, see Specification A314. 
NoTE 2-For free-machining stainless bars designed especially for 
optimum machinability, see Specification A582/A582M. 
NoTE 3-There are standards covering high nickel, chromium, auste­
nitic corrosion, and heat-resisting alloy materials. These standards are 
under the jurisdiction of ASTM Subcommittee B02.07 and may be found 
in Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol. 02.04. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements rnay include but are not 
limited to the following: 
3.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), 
3.1.2 Name of material: stainless steel, 
3.1.3 Form (bars, angles, and so forth), 
3.1.4 Condition (Section 4.1), 
3.1.5 Finish (Section 8 of Specification A484/A484M), 
3.1.6 Surface preparation of shapes (Section 8 of Specifica-
tion A484/A484M), 
3 .1. 7 Applicable dimensions including size, thickness, 
width, and length, 1, 
3.1.8 Cross section (round, square, and so forth), 
3.1.9 Type or UNS designation (Table 1), 
3.1.10 ASTM designation and date of issue, and 
3 .1.11 Whether bars are to be rolled as bars or cut from strip 
or plate. 
3.1.12 Test for magnetic permeability when specified by 
customer purchase order when ordering Types 201 and 205. 
3 .1.13 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test 
Methods A1058 when material is ordered to an M suffix (SI 
units) product standard. If the choice of test track is not 
specified in· the order, then the default ASTM track shall be 
used as noted in Test Methods A1058. 
3.1.14 Supplementary requirements, and 
3.1.15 Additional requirements.
