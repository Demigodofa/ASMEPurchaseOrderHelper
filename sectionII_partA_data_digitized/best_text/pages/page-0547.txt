6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 All seamless and welded tubes, other than Grades 
8 and 11, shall be treated to control their microstmcture 
in accordance with one of the following methods: 
6.1.1 Normalize by heating to a uniform temperature 
of not less than 1550°F [845°C] and cool in air or in the 
cooling chamber of an atmosphere controlled furnace. 
6.1.2 Normalize as in 10.1.1, and, at the discretion 
of the manufacturer, reheat to a suitable tempering temper­
ature. 
6.1.3 For the seamless process only, reheat and con­
trol hot working and the temperature of the hot-finishing 
operation to a finishing temperature range from 1550 to 
1750°F [845 to 955°C] and cool in a controlled atmosphere 
furnace from an initial temperature of not less than 1550°F 
[845°C]. 
6.1.4 Treat as in 6.1.3 and, at the discretion of the 
manufacturer, reheat to a suitable tempering temperature. 
6.2 Grade 8 tubes shall be heat treated by the manufac­
turer by either of the following methods. 
6.2.1 Quenched and Tempered - Heat to a unifom1 
temperature of 1475 ± 25°F [800 ± l5°C]; hold at this 
temperature for a minimum time in the ratio of 1 h/in. 
[2 min/mm] of thiclmess, but in no case less than 15 min; 
quench by immersion in circulating water. Reheat until the 
pipe attains a uniform temperature within the range from 
1050 to 1125°F [565 to 605°C]; hold at this temperature 
for a minimum time in the ratio of 1 h/in. [2 min/mm] of 
thickness, but in no case less than 15 min; cool in air or 
water quench at a rate no less than 300°F [165°C]/h. 
6.2.2 Double Normalized and Tempered - Heat to 
a unifonn temperature of 1650 ± 25°F [900 ± 15°C]; hold 
at this temperature for a minimum time in the ratio of 1 
h/in. [2 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 
15 min; cool in air. Reheat until the pipe attains a uniform 
temperature of 1450 ± 25°F [790 ± l5°C]; hold at this 
temperature for a minimum time in the ratio of 1 h/in. 
[2 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 15 min; 
cool in air. Reheat to a uniform temperature within the 
range from 1050 to 1125°F [565 to 605°C]; hold at this 
temperature for a minimum time of 1 h/in. [2 min/mm] of 
thickness but in no case less than 15 min; cool in air or 
water quench at a rate not less than 300°F [165°C]/h. 
6.3 Material from which impact specimens are obtained 
shall be in the same condition of heat treatment as the 
finished tubes. 
6.4 Whether to anneal Grade 11 tubes is per agreement 
between purchaser and supplier. When Grade 11 tubes are 
annealed they shall be normalized in the range of 1400 to 
1600°F [760 to 870°C]. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
7.2 When Grades 1 or 6 are ordered under this specifi­
cation, supplying an alloy grade that specifically requires 
the addition of any element other than those listed for the 
ordered grade in Table 1 is not pennitted. However, the 
addition of elements required for the deoxidation of the 
steel is permitted. 
8. Product Analysis 
8.1 An analysis of either one billet or one length of 
flat-rolled stock or one tube shall be made for each heat. 
The chemical composition thus determined shall conform 
to the requirements specified. 
8.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests 
of two additional billets, lengths of flat-rolled stock, or 
tubes shall be made. Both retests, for the elements in ques­
tion, shall meet the requirements of the specification; other­
wise all remaining material in the heat or lot shall be 
rejected or, at the option of the manufacturer, each billet, 
length of flat-rolled stock, or tube may be individually 
tested for acceptance. Billets, lengths of flat-rolled stock, 
or tubes which do not meet the requirements of the specifi­
cation shall be rejected. 
9 Sampling 
495 
9.1 For flattening, flare, and flange requirements, the 
term lot applies to all tubes prior to cutting of the same 
nominal size and wall thickness which are produced from 
the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a 
batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
the same size and from the same heat which are heat treated 
in the same furnace charge. When the final heat treatment 
is in a continuous furnace, the number of tubes of the same 
size and from the same heat in a lot shall be determined 
from the size of the tubes as prescribed in Table 2. 
9.2 For tensile and hardness test requirements, the term 
lot applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal 
diameter and wall thickness which are produced from the 
same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a batch­
type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the 
same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the 
same furnace charge. When the final heat treatment is in 
a continuous furnace, a lot shall include,aU tubes of the 
same size and heat, heat treated in the same furnace at the 
same temperature, time at heat and furnace speed. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 The material shall conform to the requirements 
as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 3.
