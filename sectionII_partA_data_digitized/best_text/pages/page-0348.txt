SA-214/SA-214M ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 
Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Carbon Steel Heat-Exchanger 
and Condenser Tubes 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
electric-resistance-welded, carbon steel tubes to be used for 
heat exchangers, condensers, and similar heat-transfer appara­
tus. 
1.2 The tubing sizes usually furnished to this specification 
are to 3 in. [76.2 mm] in outside diameter, inclusive. Tubing 
having other dimensions may be furnished, provided such 
tubes comply with all other requirements of this specification. 
1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.4 The purchaser shall specify in the order the outside 
diameter and minimum wall thickness. The inside diameter 
shall not be specified. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. 
2. Referenced Documents 
2.1 ASTM Standards: 
A450/ A450M Specification for General Requirements for 
Carbon and Low Alloy Steel Tubes 
3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for material under this specification should 
include the following, as required, to describe the desired 
material adequately: 
3.1.l Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material (electric-resistance-welded tubes), 
3.1.3 Size (outside diameter and minimum wall thickness), 
3.1.4 Length (specific or random), 
3.1.5 Optional requirements (Section 8 and 10.5), 
3.1.6 Test report required (see Certification Section of 
Specification A450/A450M), 
296 
3.1.7 Specification designation, and 
3.1.8 Special requirements. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A450/ A450M, unless otherwise provided herein. 
5. Manufacture 
5 .1 Tubes shall be made by electric-resistance welding. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 After welding, all tubes shall be heat treated at a 
temperature of 1650°F [900°C] or higher and followed by 
cooling in air or in the cooling chamber of a controlled 
atmosphere furnace. Cold drawn tubes shall be heat treated 
after the final cold-draw pass at a temperature of 1200°F 
[650°C] or higher. •
