9. Permissible Variations in Dimensions of Centrifugally 
Cast Pipe 
9 .1 Thickness-The wall thickness of centrifugally cast pipe 
shall not vary over that specified by more than Vs in. [3 mm]. 
There shall be no variation under the specified wall thickness. 
10. Rework, Welding, and Retreatment 
10.l Defects, as defined in Section 8, shall be removed and 
their removal verified by visual inspection of the resultant 
cavities. Defects that are located by inspecting with supple­
mentary requirements specified in the order shall be removed 
or reduced to an acceptable size. 
10.2 If removal of the defect does not impinge upon the 
minimum wall thickness, if applicable, the depression may be 
blended uniformly into the surrounding surface. 
10.3 Welding is permitted, subject to the following require­
ments: 
10.3.1 Only welders and procedures qualified in accordance 
with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX, shall 
be used. 
10.3.2 For Grade C91, all welding shall be made with one of 
the processes and consumables shown in Table 3. In addition, 
the sum of the Ni + Mn content of all weld consumables used 
for weld repair shall not exceed 1.0 %. 
10.3.3 For Grade C933, close matching parent chemistry 
welding consumables shall be used, such as AWS A5.5/A5.5M 
designation B9015 H4, matching the chemistry in Table 4. 
Other undermatching electrodes may be agreed upon between 
the purchaser and manufacturer but may result in reduced 
high-temperature creep performance. 
~0.3.3.1 When Supplementary Requirement S4 of Specifi­
~ation ~703/A703M or A985/A985M for investment castings 
1s specified, welds shall be inspected by magnetic particle 
ex~nation to the same standards that are used to inspect the 
castings. 
~0.3.3.2 When Supplementary Requirement S5 of Specifi­
~ation ~703/A703M or A985/A985M for investment castings 
1s specified, welds on castings that have leaked on hydrostatic 
test, or o? castings in which the depth of any cavity prepared 
for weldmg exceeds 20 % of the wall thickness or 1 in. 
[25 _mm], whichever is smaller, or on castings in which any 
cavity prepared for welding is greater than approximately 
10 in.2 [65 cm 2 ], shall be radiographed to the same standards 
that are used to inspect the castings. 
10.3.4 Welds shall be considered major in the case of a 
casting that has leaked on hydrostatic test, or when the depth of 
the cavity prepared for welding exceeds 20 % of the wall 
thickness or 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is smaller, or when the 
extent of the cavity exceeds approximately 10 in.2 [65 cm 2 ]. 
Welds not meeting these requirements shall be considered 
minor welds.

welds shall be included in the material test report. 
10.3.7 When specified by the purchaser, the locations of all

10.3.8 Post-WeldHeatTreatmentforGrade C91-All welds 
shall be heat treated in accordance with one of the following 
requirements, as applicable: 
10.3.8.1 For castings for which re-austenitizing does not 
lead to unacceptable distortion, defined as violation of the 
tolerances of the specification or contained in the purchase 
order, the following shall apply: Castings containing a weld 
made after the austenitizing and tempering heat treatment in 
5.1 ~hall be re-austenitized and tempered according to the 
reqwrements of 5.1. Local heat treatment is not permitted. 
10.3.8.2 For castings for which re-austenitizing does lead to 
unacceptable distortion, and with the agreement of the 
pur~haser, in lieu of re-austenitizing and tempering, the fol­
lowmg shall apply: 
( 1) Welds shall be heat treated within the temperature range 
~f 1350 to 1470 °F [730 to 800 °C], for a minimum holding 
time based on the maximum thickness of the casting. 
(2) Castings having a maximum thickness :S5 in. [125 mm] 
shall be held at temperature for 1 h per inch of thickness [l h 
per 25 mm of thickness], except that 30 minutes minimum is 
permitted for castings having a maximum thickness less than 
1 in. [25 mm]. 
( 3) Castings having a maximum thickness greater than 5 in. 
[125 mm] shall be held at temperature for 5 h, plus 15 minutes 
for each additional inch [25 mm] over 5 in. [125 mm]. 
10.3.8.3 Local post-weld heat treatment is permitted only by 
agreement between the producer and the purchaser. Process 
requirements, to ensure that the minimum post-weld heat 
treatment is reached in welds and that the maximum post-weld 
heat treatment is not exceeded anywhere on the casting, shall 
be as agreed upon by the producer and the purchaser. 
10.3.8.4 Castings shall be designated as Class 1 or Class 2 
depending on the type of weld (see 10.3.4) and heat treatment' 
as shown in Table 5. ' 
~oTE 3-For Class 2 castings, ASME or other construction codes may 
assign allowable stresses or pressure ratings different from and more
