ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
In addition, the following supplementary requirements are suitable for this application. 
S53. Alternative Location for Mechanical Testing 
S53.1 When specified by the purchaser, the axis of the 
tensile and impact test specimens shall come from the mid­
thickness of each plate tested, in lieu of midway between the 
center thickness and the top or bottom surface of the plate. 
S62. Temper Embrittlement Factor 
S62.1 The composition of the steel, based on heat analysis, 
shall be restricted in accordance with the following equations: 
J = (Si+Mn) X(P+Sn) X 104:5150 (Si, Mn, P, and Sn in wt%) 
Cn:5 0.20% 
Ni:5 0.30% 
S62.1.1 Lower values of J, Cu, and Ni can be specified by 
agreement between purchaser and the supplier. 
S62.1.2 When so specified by the purchaser, the maximum 
value of J shall not exceed 100. 
S62.1.3 The values of J shall be reported. 
S62.1.4 If the plates are repaired by welding, the composi­
tion of the weld deposit shall be restricted in accordance with 
the following equations: 
X = (IOP+ 5Sb+4Sn+ As)/100 :5 15 (P, Sb, Sn, and As in ppm) 
Cu :5 0.20% 
Ni:5 0.30% 
S62.1.5 The values of X shall be reported. 
S63. Impact Properties After Step Cooling 
S63.1 The Charpy V-notch impact properties shall be deter­
mined as follows: 
S63.1.1 A suffi.cient amount of Charpy V-notch test speci­
mens shall be taken from the same location from a plate from 
each heat of steel to construct two transition temperature 
curves. 
S63 .1.2 The test specimens for one transition temperature 
S63.2 The test specimens for the other transition tempera­
ture curve shall be given the PWHT cycle specified in S63.1.2 
plus the following step cooling heat treatment: 
Hold at 1100°F (593°C) for 1 h, then cool at 10°F (5.6°C)/h 
to 1000°F (538°C). 
Hold at 1000°F (538°C) for 15 h, then cool at 10°F (5.6°C)/h 
to 975°F (524°C). 
Hold at 975°F (524°C) for 24 h, then cool at 10°F (5.6°C)/h 
to 925°F (496°C). 
Hold at 925°F (496°C) for 60 h, then cool at 5°F (2.8°C)/h 
to 875°F (468°C). 
Hold at 875°F (468°C) for 100 h, then cool at 50°F 
(27.8°C)/h to 600°F (315°C). 
Coo 1 in still air. 
S63.3 Test the Charpy V-notch test specimens in accordance 
with Test Methods and Definitions A370 to determine the 40 
ft-lbs (55 J) transition temperature from each transition tem­
perature curve using a set of three test specimens at each test 
temperature. The test temperatures shall include tests on the 
upper and lower shelves and a minimum of four intermediate 
temperatures. 
S63.4 The following requirements shall be met.
