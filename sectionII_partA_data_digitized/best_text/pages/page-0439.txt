ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-265 
3.1.3 alloy cladding-the nickel or nickel-base alloy com­
ponent of the composite plate. 
3.1.4 base metal (backing steel)-component to which the 
alloy cladding is applied, usually the greater percentage of the 
composite plate and usually consisting of carbon or low-alloy 
steel. 
3.1.5 integrally and continuously bonded-the process by 
which the alloy cladding and base metal are brought together to 
form a metallurgical bond at essentially the entire interface of 
the two metals by means other than those processes that do not 
produce a homogeneous composite plate. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements may include, but are not 
limited to the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces). 
4.1.2 Heat treatment, if required (see Section 5). 
4.1.3 Dimensions, including the thickness of the cladding 
alloy and the backing steel, or of the total composite plate and 
if more or less restrictive thickness tolerances apply. 
4.1.4 Cladding alloy specification (see Section 6). 
4.1.5 Base metal specification (see Section 6). 
4.1.6 Product analysis, if required. Specify whether appli­
cable to the cladding alloy, backing steel, or both (see Section 
10). 
4.1.7 Mechanical Properties (see Sections 7, 13, and 14). 
4.1.8 Restrictions, if required, on repair by welding (see 
Section 14). 
4.1.9 Additions to the specification or special requirements 
such as applicable constmction code rules. 
4.1.10 Corrosions tests, if required. 
4.1.11 Notification when the cladding alloy is to be used for 
inclusion in the design strength calculations for an applicable 
construction code. 
N OTB I-Construction codes may dictate certain fabrication require­
ments when the cladding is used in the design calculations that may be 
different than if the cladding is used for corrosion resistance only. This 
may be particularly important when the alloy cladding involves the use of 
welded components in the explosion bonded clad manufacturing process. 
It is incumbent on the purchaser to make the clad manufacturer aware of 
any such restrictions or applications at time of order. 
4.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this specification 
and the backing steel specification, certain supplementary 
requirements are available when additional control, testing, or 
examination is required to meet end use requirements. The 
purchaser is referred to the listed supplementary requirements 
in this specification and to the detailed requirements in 
Specification A20/ A20M. 
4.2.1 Nondestructive examination, 
4.2.2 Impact testing, and 
4.2.3 Simulated Post-Weld Heat Treatment of Mechanical 
Test Coupons (SPWHT). 
4.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4.4 Special tests. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Process: 
5.1.1 The steel shall be made by the open-hearth, electric­
furnace (with separate degassing and refining optional), or 
basic-oxygen processes, or by secondary processes whereby 
steel made from these primary processes is remelted using, but 
not limited to electroslag remelting or vacuum arc remelting 
processes. 
5.1.2 The cladding metal may be metallurgically bonded to 
the base metal by any method that will produce a clad steel that 
will conform to the requirements of this specification. 
5.1.3 For explosively bonded products, the alloy cladding 
metal may be comprised of two or more separnte alloy plates 
or sheets completely welded together to form a single fabri­
cated component. 
5.2 Heat Treatment-Unless a specific heat treatment is 
required by the cladding matelial or base steel specification, or 
unless otherwise agreed upon by the purchaser and 
manufacturer, the clad plate shall be furnished in a condition 
that is appropriate for the cladding alloy, base metal, or both. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The composite plate may conform to any desired com­
bination cladding metal and base metal as described in 6.2 and 
6.3, and as agreed upon between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
6.2 Cladding Metal-The nickel or nickel-base alloy clad­
ding metal specified shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed for the respective metal in 
Specifications B127, Bl 62, Bl 68, B333, B409, B424, B443, 
B463, B575, B582, and B625, or other nickel-base alloy as 
agreed upon by the purchaser and manufacturer. 
6.3 Base Metal-The base metal shall be carbon steel or 
low-alloy steel conforming to the ASTM specifications for 
steels for either pressure vessels or general structural 
applications, or other, as agreed upon by the purchaser and 
manufacturer. The base metal shall conform to the chemical 
requirements of the specification to which it is ordered.

7. Mechanical Properties 
7.l Tensile Requirements: 
7 .1.1 The tensile properties shall be determined by a tension 
test of the composite plate for clad plates that meet all of the 
following conditions. 
( 1) The nominal composite gage is less than or equal to 1 ½ 
in (38 mm).
