in accordance with ASME Specification SFA-5.5. The sub­
merged arc process with neutral flux, the gas metal-arc welding 
and gas tungsten-arc welding processes are permitted. 
13.1.3 Defects shall be completely removed prior to weld­
ing by chipping or grinding to sound metal as verified by 
magnetic particle inspection in accordance with Test Method 
A275/A275M for the alloy steels in this specification, or by 
liquid penetrant inspection in accordance with Test Method 
E165/El65M for all grades. 
13.1.4 After repair welding, the welded area shall be ground 
smooth to the original contour and shall be free of defects as 
verified by magnetic-particle or liquid-penetrant inspection, as 
applicable. 
13.l.5 The preheat, interpass temperature, and post-weld 
heat treatment, requirements given in Table 6 shall be met. 
13.1.6 Repair by welding shall not exceed 10 % of the 
surface area of the part. Repair by welding shall not exceed 
33Y3 % of the wall thickness of the finished part or 3/s in. [9.5 
mm], whichever is less. 
14. Inspection 
14.1 The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's inspector 
all reasonable facilities necessary to satisfy the inspector that 
the material is being furnished in accordance with the purchase 
order. Inspection by the purchaser shall not interfere unneces­
sarily with the manufacturer's operations. All tests and inspec­
tions shall be made at the place of manufacture unless 
otherwise agreed upon. 
15. Rejection 
15.l Each part that develops defects during shop working 
operations or in service shall be rejected and the manufacturer 
notified. 
15.2 Samples representing material rejected by the pur­
chaser shall be preserved until disposition of the claim has been 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
16. Certification 
16.1 In addition to the certification requirements of Speci­
fication A961/A961M, test reports shall be furnished to the 
purchaser or his representative. Test reports shall provide the 
following as applicable: 
16.1.1 Type of heat treatment, Section 7, (Table 2), 
16.1.2 Chemical analysis results, Section 6 (Table 1), re­
ported results shall be to the same number of significant figures 
as the limits specified in Table 1 for that element, 
16.1.3 Product analysis results, Section 10 (Table 4 or Table 
5), 
16.1.4 Tensile property results, Section 9 (Table 3), report 
the yield strength and tensile strength, in ksi [MPa], elongation 
and reduction in area, in percent, 
16.1.5 Hardness results, 9.6 (Table 3), 
16.1.6 Structural integrity test results, Section 8, and 
16.1.7 Any supplementary testing required by the purchase 
order. 
17. Product Marking 
17 .1 In addition to marking requirements of Specification 
A961/A961M, the following additional marking requirements 
shall apply: 
17 .1.1 Quenched and tempered alloy steel parts shall be 
marked with the letters "QT" following the specification 
designation. 
17.1.2 Hot isostatically-pressed parts repaired by welding 
shall be marked with the letter "W" following the specification 
designation. 
17 .1.3 Hot isostatically-pressed parts meeting all require­
ments for more than one class or grade are permitted at the 
option of the producer to be marked with more than one class 
or grade designation. 
17.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 17.1, 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order that a specific 
bar coding system be used. The bar coding system, if applied 
at the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one 
of the published industry standards for bar coding. If used on 
small parts, the bar code may be applied to the box or a 
substantially applied tag.
