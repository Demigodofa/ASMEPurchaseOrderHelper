SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
In addition to any of the supplementary requirements of Specification A961/A961M, the following 
supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the order. 
Sl. Macroetch Test 
S 1.1 A sample forging shall be sectioned and etched to 
show flow lines and internal imperfections. The test shall be 
conducted according to Test Method E340. Details of the test 
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
S2. Heat Treatment Details 
S2. l The manufacturer shall furnish a detailed test report 
containing the information required in 18.2 and shall include 
all pertinent details of the heat-treating cycle given the forg­
ings. 
S3. Material for Optimum Resistance to Stress-Corrosion 
Cracking 
S3 .1 Austenitic stainless steel shall be furnished in the 
solution-annealed condition as a final operation with no sub­
sequent cold working permitted, except, unless specifically 
prohibited by the purchaser, straightening of bars from which 
parts are machined is permitted to meet the requirements of 
Specification A484/A484M. 
S4. Corrosion Tests 
S4. l All austenitic stainless steels shall pass intergranular 
corrosion tests performed in accordance with Practice E of 
Practices A262. 
S4.2 Intergranular corrosion tests shall be performed on 
specimens of ferritic stainless steels as described in Practices 
A763. 
S4.3 For both the austenitic and ferritic stainless steels, 
details concerning the number of specimens and their source 
and location are to be a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
S5. Special Filler Metal 
S5.1 In repair-welded F 316, F 316L, F 316H, and F 316N 
forgings, the deposited weld metal shall conform to E 308 
composition wire. Forgings repair welded with E 308 weld 
metal shall be marked F W 308. 
S6. Hardness Test 
S6. l Each forging shall be hardness tested and shall meet 
the requirements of Table 3. 
SS. Heat Treatment of Austenitic Forgings 
S8.l The purchaser shall specify the heat-treatment method 
(in 7.1 or in 7.3.1) that shall be employed. 
S8.2 The manufacturer shall provide a test report containing 
the information required in 18.2 and shall include a statement 
of the heat-treatment method employed. 
S9. Grain Size for Austenitic Grades 
S9.1 Forgings made from austenitic grades other than H 
grades shall be tested for average grain size by Test Method 
El12. Details of the test shall be agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
SlO. Stabilizing Treatment 
SlO.l Subsequent to the solution anneal for Grades F 321, F 
321H, F 347, F 347H, F 348, and F 348H, these grades shall be 
given a stabilizing treatment at 1500 to 1600 °F [815 to 870 
0 C] for a minimum of 2 h/in. [4.7 min/mm] of thickness and 
then cooling in the furnace or in air. In addition to the marking 
required in Section 19, the grade designation symbol shall be 
followed by the symbol "SlO." 
Sll. Grain Size Requirements for Non-H-Grade Austenitic 
Steels Used Above 1000 °F [540 °C] 
Sll.1 Non-H grades of austenitic stainless steels shall have 
a grain size of No. 7 or coarser as determined in accordance 
with Test Methods El 12. The grain size so determined shall be 
on a certified test report. 
S12. Detection of Detrimental Phases in Austenitic/Ferritic 
Stainless Steels 
S 12.1 All austenitic/ferritic stainless steels that are included 
in Test Methods A923 shall meet the requirements of those test 
methods. 
S 12.2 All austenitic/ferritic stainless steels that are included 
in Test Method A1084 shall meet the requirements of that test 
method. 
S13. Minimum Cooling Rate for Grade T91 Type 2 
S13.1 For Grade P91 Type 2 material, the heat treatment 
shall ensure that following austenitizing the rate of cooling 
from 1650 °F to 900 °F [900 °C to 480 °C] is no slower than 
9 °F/min [5 °C/ min].
