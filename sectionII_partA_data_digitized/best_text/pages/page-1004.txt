SA-533/SA-533M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Quenched and 
Tempered, Manganese-Molybdenum and Manganese­
Molybdenum-Nickel 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers one type of manganese­
molybdenum and four types of manganese-molybdenum­
nickel alloy steel plates for use in the quenched and tempered 
condition for the construction of welded pressure vessels. 
1.2 Material under this specification is available in five 
types, designated "A", "B", "C", "D", and "E". The material is 
also available in three classes having the following strength 
levels. 
Class Tensile Strength, 
ksi [MPa] 
1 80-100 [550 to 690] 
2 90-115 [620 to 795] 
3 100-125 [690 to 860] 
1.3 The maximum thickness of Class 1 and Class 2 plates is 
limited only by the capacity of the composition to meet the 
specified mechanical property requirements; however, current 
practice normally limits the maximum thickness to 12 in. [300 
mm] for Types A through D and to 7 in. [180 mm] for Type E. 
1.4 The maximum thickness of Class 3 plates is 2½ in. [65 
mm] for Types A through D and 2 in. [50 mm] for Type E. 
1.5 The minimum nominal thickness of plates of all classes 
is 0.25 in. [6.5 mm]. 
1.6 These alloy steel plates in the as-rolled condition are 
sensitive to cracking during transit and handling, particularly in 
thicknesses over about 1 or 2 in. [25 or 50 mm]. They should 
be shipped in the as-rolled conditions only by mutual agree­
ment of manufacturer and the purchaser. 
properties may be affected by high levels of radiation. Appen­
dix Xl provides some information pertinent to this usage. 
1.8 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation.
