ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-703/SA-703M 
when T exceeds 5 in. [125 mm], the dimension may be 15 by 
15 by 5 in. [375 by 375 by 125 mm], by agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. The test coupon shall be of the 
same heat of steel and shall receive substantially the same 
casting practices as the production casting it represents. Cen­
trifugal castings may be represented by statically cast coupons. 
(See Specification Al067/Al067M, Fig. 6.) 
S26.3.4 When agreed upon between the manufacturer and 
the purchaser, castings that are cast or machined to essentially 
the finished configuration prior to heat treatment shall have test 
specimens removed from a prolongation or other stock on the 
casting at a location below the nearest heat-treated surface 
indicated on the order. The specimen location shall be at a 
distance below the nearest heat-treated surface equivalent to at 
least the greatest distance that the indicated high-tensile-stress 
surface will be from the nearest heat-treated surface and a 
minimum of twice this distance from a second heat-treated 
surface, except that the test specimens shall be no nearer than 
¾ in. [19 mm] to a heat-treated surface and 1 ½ in. [38 mm] 
from a second heat-treated surface. (See Specification Al067/ 
Al067M, Fig. 7.) 
S26.3.5 Where specimens are to be removed from the body 
of quenched and tempered castings, either the requirements of 
S26.3.1 shall be met or a steel thermal buffer pad or thermal 
insulation or other thermal barriers shall be used during heat 
treatment. Steel thermal buffer pads shall be a minimum of T 
by T by 3 T in length and shall be joined to the casting surface 
by a partial penetration weld completely sealing the buffered 
surface. Test specimens shall be removed from the casting in a 
location adjacent to the center third of the buffer pad. They 
shall be located at a minimum distance of½ in. [13 mm] from 
the buffered surface and ¼ T from other heat-treated surfaces 
(see Specification Al067/Al067M, Fig. 7). When thermal 
insulation is used, it shall be applied adjacent to the casting 
surface where the test specimens are to be removed. The 
producer shall demonstrate that the cooling rate of the test 
specimen location is no faster than that of specimens taken by 
the method described in S26.3.1 
S27. Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIPing) 
S27 .1 Castings shall be processed by hot isostatic pressing 
(HIPing) according to Practice Al080. Unless specified by the 
purchaser in the purchase order or contract, the HIPing time, 
temperature, pressure, and other parameters shall be at the 
discretion of the producer. 
S28. Cleaning of Stainless Steels 
S28.1 Final cleaning of the casting surfaces shall be per­
formed in accordance with one of the cleaning methods in 
Practice A380/A380M or Specification A967/A967M as 
agreed upon between the purchaser and supplier. Acceptance 
testing shall be subject to agreement between the purchaser and 
supplier.

S33. Stabilization Heat Treatment of CFSC 
S33.1 CF8C shall be stabilized at 1600 to 1650 °F [870 to 
900 °C] for a minimum time of 1 h/in. [25 mm] of thickness 
and water quenched or rapidly cooled by other means. The 
grade designation symbol shall be followed by the symbol 
"S33." 
S34. Stabilization Heat Treatment of CFlOMC 
S34.1 CFlOMC shall be stabilized at 1600 to 1650 °F [870 
to 900 °C] for a minimum time of 1 h/in. [25 mm] of thickness 
and water quenched or rapidly cooled by other means. The 
grade designation symbol shall be followed by the symbol
