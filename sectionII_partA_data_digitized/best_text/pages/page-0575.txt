8.4.3 The longitudinal axis and mid-length of impact speci­
men shall be located similarly to the longitudinal axis of the 
tension test specimens. The axis of the notch shall be normal to 
the nearest heat-treated surface of the forging. 
8.4.4 The Charpy V-notch tests shall meet a minimum 
energy absorption value of 40 ft·lbf [54 J] average of three 
specimens. One specimen only in one set may be below 
40 ft-lbf [54 J] and it shall meet a minimum value of 35 ft·lbf 
[48 J]. 
8.4.5 The impact test temperature shall be not warmer than 
0 °F [-18 °C]. 
8.4.6 Unless Supplementary Requirement S13 of Specifica­
tion A 788/ A 788M is specified by the purchaser, for Grade 
F6NM forgings a minimum average absorbed energy of 
20 ft-lbf [27 J] for each test shall apply at a temperature not 
warmer than -100 °F [-73 °C]. 
9. Ultrasonic Examination 
9.1 For F91 Type 1 and Type 2 and F92 hollow forgings, 
either S20, Ultrasonic Examination, or S22, Ultrasonic Exami­
nation from the Bore Surface, of Specification A788/A788M, 
shall be mandatory. 
10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
10.1 When fOigings have been heat-treated by quenching 
and tempering, all accessible surfaces shall subsequently be 
examined for quench cracks by the magnetic particle method in 
accordance with Practice A275/A275M. 
11. Repair Welding 
11.1 Repair welding of forgings may be permitted but only 
at the option of the purchaser. Such repair welds shall be made 
in accordance with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code, Section IX. 
11.2 All repair welds in F91 Type 1 and Type 2 shall be 
made with one of the following welding processes and con­
sumables: SMAW, SFA5.5 E90XX-B9; SAW, SFA5.23 EB9 + 
flux; GTAW, SFA5.28 ER90S-B9; and FCAW 5.29 E91Tl-B9. 
In addition, the sum of the Ni+Mn content of all welding 
consumables used to fabricate F91 Type 1 and Type 2 forgings 
shall not exceed 1.0 %. 
11.3 All repair welds in F92 shall be made with one of the 
following processes: SMAW, SAW, GTAW, or FCAW; and the 
composition of the welding consumables shall meet the re­
quirements for F92 in Table 2. 6 
12. Marking 
12.1 In addition to the marking requirements of Specifica­
tion A788/A788M, the specification marking shall be followed 
by the letter A for annealed, N for normalized and tempered, or 
Q for liquid quenched and tempered as applicable. 
12.2 For F91 additional marking shall include the appropri­
ate Type. 
13. Test Reports 
13.1 The certification requirements of Specification A788/ 
A 788M shall apply. 
14. Keywords 
14.1 chromium alloy steel; chromium-molybdenum steel; 
martensitic stainless steel; pressure containing parts; pressure 
vessel service; steel forgings-alloy; temperature service 
applications-high 
6 This requirement ensures that the sum of Ni + Mn in the welding consumables 
shall not exceed 1.0 %. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the 
purchaser in the inquiry, contract, and order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
Sl. Rough Turning and Boring 
S 1.1 The position of the rough turning and boring in the 
sequence of manufacturing operations shall be specified. 
S2. • Transverse Mechanical Testing 
S2.1 Instead of test specimens taken in accordance with 
8.2.1, the longitudinal axis of the test specimens shall be 
transverse to the direction of major working of the forging. The 
tension test results shall conform with requirements of Table 1, 
with the exception of the ductility limits which shall be as 
prescribed in Table S2. l. When required, the Charpy impact 
test results shall conform to 8.4. 
S3. Alternative Test Specimen Requirements 
S3.l The test requirements for materials of the ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Code, Section III, Article NB-2223.3, shall 
be used in place of that specified in 8.2.1.1. 
523 
S4. Hydrostatic Test 
S4.1 A hydrostatic pressure test shall be applied. The details 
of the test, including its position in the sequence of manufac­
turing operations, shall be specified. 
S6. Liquid Penetrant Examination 
S6.1 After forgings have been heat-treated by quenching 
and tempering, all accessible surfaces shall be inspected for 
quench cracks by the liquid penetrant method in accordance 
with Practice E165/E165M as an alternative to magnetic 
particle examination. 
S7. Marking 
S7 .1 Forgings shall be marked at a location indicated by the 
purchaser in the purchase order or drawing.
