7 .1 If pickling or shot blasting or both are required, this 
shall be specifically stated in the order. 
8. Chemical Composition 
8.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
8.2 When a grade is ordered under this specification, sup­
plying an alloy grade that specifically requires the addition of 
any element other than those listed for the ordered grade in 
Table 1 is not permitted. 
9. Product Analysis 
9.1 When requested on the purchase order, a product analy­
sis shall be made by the supplier from one tube or billet per 
heat. The chemical composition thus determined shall conform 
to the requirements specified. 
9.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional billets or tubes shall be made. Both retests for 
the elements in question shall meet the requirements of the 
specification; otherwise, all remaining material in the heat or 
lot (see Note 2) shall be rejected or, at the option of the 
producer, each billet or tube may be individually tested for 
acceptance. Billets or tubes which do not meet the require­
ments of the specification shall be rejected. 
Now 2-For flattening and flaring requirements, the term "lot" applies 
to all tubes prior to cutting of the same nominal size and wall thickness 
which are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment 
is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the same 
size and from the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, the 
number of tubes of the same size and from the same heat in a lot shall be 
determined from the size of the tubes as prescribed in Table 2. 
NoTE 3-For tensile and hardness test requirements, the term "lot" 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall 
thickness which are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of 
the same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, a lot shall 
include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the same furnace 
at the same temperature, time at heat, and furnace speed. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties prescribed in Table 3. 
10.2 Table 4 gives the computed minimum elongation 
values for each 1/32-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. 
Where the wall thickness lies between two values shown 
above, the minimum elongation value shall be determined by 
the following equation: 
E = 48t+ 15.00 [ E = l.87t+ 15.00] 
where: 
E elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm, %, and 
= actual thiclmess of specimen, in. [mm]. 
11. Hardness Requirements 
11.1 The tubes shall have a hardness not exceeding the 
following: 79 HRBW or 143 HBW for Grade A-1, 89 HRBW 
or 179 HBW for Grade C. 
12. Mechanical Tests Required 
12.1 Tension Test-One tension test shall be made on a 
specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall 
be made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes (see Note 3). 
12.2 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of one finished tube from each lot 
(see Note 2), but not the one used for the flaring test. Tears or 
breaks occurring at the 12 or 6 o'clock positions on Grade C 
tubing with sizes of 2.375 in. [60.3 mm] in outside diameter 
and smaller shall not be considered a basis for rejection. 
12.3 Flaring Test-One flaring test shall be made on speci­
mens from each end of the one finished tube from each lot (see 
Note 2), but not the one used for the flattening test. 
12.4 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot (see 
Note 3).
