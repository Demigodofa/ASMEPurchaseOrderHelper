11.1 Tension Test-One tension test shall be made on a 
specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall 
be made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes (Note 1). 
11.2 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens taken from each end of one finished tube, not the 
one used for the flaring test, from each lot of not more than 125 
tubes or fraction thereof. 
11.3 Flaring Test-One flaring test shall be made on speci­
mens taken from each end of one finished tube, not the one 
~~~~used--f'ot- flattening test~om each lot of not more than 125 
tubes or fraction thereof. 
11.4 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot 
(Note 1).

11.5 Hydrostatic Test-Bach U-tube shall be subjected to a 
hydrostatic test, using a noncorrosive fluid, or when agreed 
upon between the purchaser and manufacturer, they may be 
tested at 1 ½ times the specified design working pressure. 
12. Nondestructive Test (Electric Test) 
12.1 Each tube shall be tested after the finish heat treatment 
following the final cold-drawn pass by passing through a 
nondestructive tester capable of detecting defects on the entire 
cross section of the tube, in accordance with Specification 
A450/A450M. 
13. Packaging and Package Marking 
13.1 The tubing shall be packaged or bundled in such a 
manner as to prevent damage in ordinary handling and trans­
portation and identified by a tag with the name of the 
manufacturer, purchase order number, specification number 
and grade, and size. . 
13.2 In the case of U-tubes, each box shall be palletized and 
legibly marked showing the manufacturer's name, purchase 
order number, specification number and grade, size, and 
identification of items contained. 
13.3 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 13.1 
and 13.2, bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identifi­
eatio~method~'f}re-pu:rcbaser may spectf'y m the order a
