15.4 Pipes that have had weld seam repairs with filler metal 
shall be identified with the symbol "WR" and shall be so stated 
and identified on the certificate of tests. If filler metal other 
than that listed in Table 4 is used, the filler metal shall be 
identified on the certificate of tests. 
15.5 Weld repairs shall be completed prior to any heat 
treatment. 
16. Product Marking 
16.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A999/ A999M, the marking shall include the manufacturer's 
private identifying mark and whether the pipe is seamless or 
welded. If specified in the purchase order, the marking for pipe 
larger than NPS 4 shall include the weight. 
17. Keywords 
17.1 duplex stainless steel; ferritic/austenitic stainless steel; 
seamless steel pipe; stainless steel pipe; steel pipe; welded steel 
pipe 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
FOR PIPE REQUIRING SPECIAL CONSIDERATION 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the 
purchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided 
in the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, 
retest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. 
Sl. Product Analysis 
S 1.1 For all pipe over NPS 5 there shall be one product 
analysis made of a representative sample from one piece for 
each ten lengths or fraction thereof from each heat of steel. 
S 1.2 For pipe smaller than NPS 5 there shall be one product 
analysis made from ten lengths per heat of steel or from 10 % 
of the number of lengths per heat of steel, whichever number 
is smaller. 
S 1.3 Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical 
requirements specified in Section 7 shall be rejected. 
S2. Transverse Tension Tests 
S2.1 There shall be one transverse tension test made from 
one end of 10 % of the lengths furnished per heat of steel. This 
applies only to pipe over NPS 8. 
S2.2 If a specimen from any length fails to conform to the 
tensile properties specified that length shall be rejected. 
S3. Flattening Test 
S3.1 The flattening test of Specification A999/A999M shall 
be made on a specimen from one end or both ends of each pipe. 
Crops ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is 
specified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. 
If a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility 
prior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening 
test requirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat­
ment in accordance with Specification A999/ A999M and 
satisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails 
because of a lack of soundness that length shall be rejected, 
unless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length 
is sound. 
S4. Etching Tests 
S4.1 The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching 
tests conducted in accordance with the appropriate portions of 
Method E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section 
from one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound 
and reasonably uniform material free of injurious laminations, 
cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this supplementary 
requirement is specified, the number of tests per pipe required 
shall also be specified. If a specimen from any length shows 
objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, subject to 
removal of the defective end and subsequent retests indicating 
the remainder of the length to be sound and reasonably uniform 
material.
