SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
In this 2025 edition, the ''.ASTM Personnel" page has been deleted from the front matter. In addition, specifications ori­
ginating with ASTM that are new or revised in this 2025 edition are formatted differently than those retained from the 
2023 and earlier editions. The document following the cover sheet of each new or revised specification is the unedited 
ASTM specification. The ASME title for the specification and any ASME-approved exceptions to the ASTM specification 
are shown only on the cover sheet. Specifications affected by the new format are listed in the Summary of Changes. 
Changes listed below are identified on the pages by a margin note, (25), placed next to the affected area.
