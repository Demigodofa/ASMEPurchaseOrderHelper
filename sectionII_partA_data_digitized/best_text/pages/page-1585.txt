to the percentages specified in Table 5 without cracking or 
showing imperfections rejectable under the provisions of the 
product specification. 
23. Flange Test 
23.1 A section of tube shall be capable of having a flange 
turned over at a right angle to the body of the tube without 
cracking or showing imperfections rejectable under the provi­
sions of the product specification. The width of the flange for 
carbon and alloy steels shall be not less than the percentages 
specified in Table 6. For the austenitic grades, the width of the 
flange for all sizes listed in Table 6 shall be not less than 15 %. 
24. Hardness Test 
24.1 For tubes with wall thickness 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] or 
over, either the Brinell or Rockwell hardness test shall be used. 
When Brinell hardness testing is used, a 10-mm ball with 3000, 
1500, or 500-kg load, or a 5-mm ball with 750-kg load shall be 
used, at the option of the manufacturer. 
24.2 For tubes with wall thickness 0.065 in. [1.7 mm] or 
over but less than 0.200 in. [5.1 mm], the Rockwell hardness 
test shall be used. 
24.3 For tubes with wall thickness less than 0.065 in. [1.7 
mm], the hardness test shall not be required. 
24.4 The Brinell hardness test shall, at the option of the 
manufacturer, be made on the outside of the tube near the end, 
on the outside of a specimen cut from the tube, or on the wall 
cross section of a specimen cut from the tube. This test shall be 
made so that the distance from the center of the impression to 
the edge of the specimen is at least 2.5 times the diameter of 
the impression. 
24.5 The Rockwell hardness test shall, at the option of the 
manufacturer, be made on the inside surface, on the wall cross 
section, or on a flat on. the outside surface. 
24.6 For tubes furnished with upset, swaged, or otherwise 
formed ends, the hardness test shall be made as prescribed in 
24.1 and 24.2 on the outside of the tube near the end after the 
forming operation and heat treatment. 
24.7 For welded or brazed tubes, the hardness test shall be 
made away from the joints.

24.8 When the product specification provides for Vickers 
hardness, such testing shall be in accordance with Test Method 
B92. 
25. Nondestructive Examination 
25.1 Except as provided in 26.1, each tube shall be exam­
ined by a nondestructive examination method in accordance 
with Practice B213, Practice E309 (for ferromagnetic 
materials), Practice B426 (for non-magnetic materials), or 
Practice E570. Upon agreement, Practice E273 shall be em­
ployed in addition to one of the full periphery tests. The range 
of tube sizes that may be examined by each method shall be 
subject to the limitations in the scope of that practice. In case 
of conflict between these methods and practices and this 
specification, the requirements of this specification shall pre­
vail. 
25.2 The following information is for the benefit of the user 
of this specification. 
25.2.1 Calibration standards for the nondestructive electric 
test are convenient standards for calibration of nondestructive 
testing equipment only. For several reasons, including shape, 
orientation, width, and so forth, the correlation between the 
signal produced in the electric test from an imperfection and 
from calibration standards is only approximate. A purchaser 
interested in ascertaining the nature (type, size, location, and 
orientation) of discontinuities that can be detected in the 
specific application of these examinations should discuss this 
with the manufacturer of the tubular product. 
25.2.2 The ultrasonic examination referred to in this speci­
fication is intended to detect longitudinal discontinuities having 
a reflective area similar to or larger than the calibration 
reference notches specified in 25.8. Th.e examination may not 
detect circumferentially oriented imperfections or short, deep . 
defects. 
25.2.3 The eddy current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
discontinuities, especially of the short abrupt type. Practices 
B309 and E426 contain additional information regarding the 
capabilities and limitations of eddy-current examination. 
25.2.4 The flux leakage examination referred to in this 
specification is capable of detecting the presence and location 
of significant longitudinally or transversely oriented disconti­
nuities. The provisions of this specification only provide for 
longitudinal calibration for flux leakage. It should be recog­
nized that different techniques should be employed to detect 
differently oriented imperfections. 
25.2.5 The hydrostatic test referred to in Section 26 is a test 
method provided for in many product specifications. This test 
has the capability of finding defects of a size permitting the test 
fluid to leak through the tube wall and may be either visually 
seen or detected by a loss of pressure. This test may not detect
