c Specified Residual Elements-Except when Supplementary Requirement S50 is specified, the total content of these elements is 1.00 % maximum. 
° For each reduction of 0.01 % below the specified maximum carbon content, an increase of 0.04 % manganese above the specified maximum will be permitted up to a 
maximum of 1.10 % for WCA, 1.28 % for wes, and 1.40 % for wee. 
4.1.2 Grade of steel, 
4.1.3 Options in the specification, 
4.1.4 Whether the castings are to be produced using the 
investment casting process, and 
4.1.5 The supplementary requirements desired, including 
the standards of acceptance. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5 .1 All castings shall receive a heat treatment proper to their 
design and chemical composition. 
5.2 Castings shall be furnished in the annealed, or 
normalized, or normalized and tempered condition unless 
Supplementary Requirement S15 is specified. 
5.3 Heat treatment shall be performed after castings have 
been allowed to cool below the transformation range. 
6. Temperature Control 
6.1 Furnace temperatures for heat treating shall be effec­
tively controlled by pyrometer. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 The steel shall be in accordance with the requirements 
as to chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
8. Tensile Requirements 
8.1 Steel used for the castings shall be in accordance with 
the requirements as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2.

0 When IeI test bars are used in tensile testing as provided for in Specification 
A703/A703M, the gage length to reduced section diameter ratio shall be 4 to 1. 
9. Quality 
9.1 The surface of the casting shall be examined visually 
and shall be free of adhering sand, scale, cracks, and hot tears. 
Other smface discontinuities shall meet the visual acceptance 
standards specified in the order. Visual Method SP-55 or other 
visual standards may be used to define acceptable surface 
discontinuities and finish. Unacceptable visual surface discon­
tinuities shall be removed and their removal verified by visual 
examination of the resultant cavities. 
9.2 When additional inspection is desired, Supplementary 
Requirements S4, S5, and SlO may be ordered. 
9.3 The castings shall not be peened, plugged, or impreg­
nated to stop leaks. 
10. Repair by Welding 
10.1 Repairs shall be made using procedures and welders 
qualified under Practice A488/A488M. 
301 
10.2 Weld repairs shall be inspected to the same quality 
standards that are used to inspect the castings. When castings 
are produced with Supplementary Requirement S4 specified, 
weld repairs shall be inspected by magnetic particle examina­
tion to the same standards that are used to inspect the castings. 
When castings are produced with Supplementary Requirement 
S5 specified, weld repairs on castings that have leaked on 
hydrostatic test, or on castings in which the depth of any cavity 
prepared for repair welding exceeds 20 % of the wall thickness 
or 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is smaller, or on castings in which 
any cavity prepared for welding is greater than approximately 
10 in.2 [65 cm 2 ], shall be radiographed to the same standards 
that are used to inspect the castings. 
10.3 Castings containing any repair weld that exceeds 20 % 
of the wall thickness or 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is smaller, or 
that exceeds approximately 10 in.2 [65 cm 2 ] in area, or that was 
made to correct hydrostatic test defects, shall be stress relieved 
or heat treated after welding. This mandatory stress relief or 
heat treatment shall be in accordance with the procedure 
qualification used.
