SA-420 /SA-420M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Piping Fittings of Wrought Carbon Steel and Alloy Steel for 
Low-Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers wrought carbon steel and 
alloy steel fittings of seamless and welded construction, cov­
ered by the latest revision of ASME B16.9, ASME B16.11, 
MSS SP-79, MSS SP-83, MSS SP-95, and MSS SP-97. 
Fittings differing from these ASME and MSS standards shall 
be furnished in accordance with Supplementary Requirement 
S58 of Specification A960/A960M. These fittings are for use in 
pressure piping and pressure vessel service at low tempera­
tures. 
1.2 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for 
fittings where a greater degree of examination is desired. When 
desired, one or more of these supplementary requirements shall 
be specified in the order. 
1.3 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
