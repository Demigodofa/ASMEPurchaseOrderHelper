tions, 
4.1.1.1 For grade 65-45-15, drawing indicating 
critical area(s) of casting (see 7.2.2 and 7.3.2). 
4.1.2 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), 
4.1.3 ASTM designation and year of issue, 
4.1.4 Grade (See Table 1), if a Grade is not specified, 
the manufacturer shall supply grade 60-40-18. 
4.1.5 Heat-treating requirements (see 5.2.1), 
4.1.6 Pressure test requirements (see 7.4.3), 
4.1. 7 Test samples from castings (see 11.1.1 and 
12.1.1), 
4.1.8 Test coupons size (see 11.2), 
4.1.9 Metallographic option (see 12.1.1), 
4.1.10 Place of inspection (see 16.1), 
4.1.11 Certification requirements (see 17.1), 
4.1.12 Identification marking (see 18.2), and 
4.1.13 Supplemental Requirements (see 1.4, 7.4.2, 
Sl and S2). 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 The melting method and the nodularizing practice 
shall be optional with the foundry. 
5.2 Except as provided in 5.2.1, all castings Grade 
60-40-18 shall be given a ferritizing heat treatment that 
produces essentially a ferritic structure that contains no 
massive carbides. 
5.2.1 When specified in the purchase order, Grade 
60-40-18 castings may be provided in an as-cast condition 
provided they comply with the requirements of 7 .1 and 
7.2.1. 
5.2.2 Castings supplied in accordance with 5 .2.1 may 
be stress relieved by agreement between the manufacturer 
and purchaser. 
5.3 Castings Grade 65-45-15 may be provided in as­
cast condition or heat treated, provided they comply with 
the requirements of 7.1, 7.2.2, and 7.3.2. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 The casting shall conform to the following require­
ments for chemical composition (Note 2): 
Total carbon, min, % 
Silicon, max, % 
Phosphorus, max, % 
3.00 
2.50 
0.08 
6.1.1 The chemical analysis for total carbon shall be 
made on chilled cast pencil type specimens or from thin 
wafers approximately ½ 2 in. [0.8 mm] thick cut from test 
coupons. Drillings are not reliable because of the probable 
loss of graphite. 
6.1.2 For each reduction of 0.01 % below the maxi­
mum specified phosphorus content, an increase of 0.08% 
silicon above the specified maximum will be permitted up 
to a maximum of 2.75%. 
NOTE 2 - Silicon contents above 2.75%, or phosphorus contents above 
0.08 % have a tendency to lower the impact resistance of the material. 
If the carbon content is below 3.00%, excess cementite may form during 
cooling and if this is not removed during heat treatment, the impact 
resistance of the material may be lowered. 
7. Requirements 
7.1 Tensile Properties: 
7.1.1 The ductile iron as represented by the test 
specimens shall conform to the mechanical property 
requirements in Table 1. 
7.2 Hardness: 
7 .2.1 For Grade 60-40-18, the hardness of the cast­
ings and test specimens shall be within the limits in Table 1. 
655 
7.2.2 For Grade 65-45-15,the hardness oftest speci­
men and the critical area(s) of the casting, as identified on 
the casting drawing, shall be within the limits in Table 1. If 
the grade 65-45-15 casting drawing does not have critical 
area(s) of the casting identified, all areas of the casting 
shall be within the hardness limits in Table 1. 
7.3 Microstructure: 
7.3.1 For Grade 60-40-18, the microstructure of the 
separately cast test coupon or the casting shall be essen­
tially ferritic and contain no massive carbides, and have a 
minimum of 90% Type I and Type II Graphite as in Fig. 1 
or Plate I of Test Method A 247. 
7.3.2 For Grade 65-45-15, the microstructure of the 
critical areas of the casting, as identified on the casting 
drawing, shall be 45% pearlitic, maximum, contain no 
massive carbides, and have a minimum 90% Type I and 
Type II Graphite as in Fig. 1 or Plate I of Test Method 
A247. 
7.4 Pressure Test Requirements: 
7 .4.1 Each pressure retaining Grade 60-40-18 casting 
shall be tested after machining to the test pressure specified 
by the applicable standard of ANSI, ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code, or other pertinent code, and shall 
show no leaks. 
7.4.2 Castings Grade 65-45-15 manufactured under 
this specification shall be capable of passing hydrostatic 
test(s) compatible with the rating of the finished cast com­
ponent. Such tests shall be conducted by the casting manu­
facturer only when Supplementary Requirement S2 is 
specified.
