FIG. 17 Assembly and Details for Lateral Expansion Gauge 
using the procedures in Section 26. Record each test tempera­
ture to the nearest I °F (0.5 °C). 
27.2.1.2 Plot the individual test results (ft•lbf or percent 
shear) as the ordinate versus the corresponding test temperature 
as the abscissa and construct a best-fit curve through the plotted 
data points. 
27 .2.1.3 If transition temperature is specified as the tem­
perature at which a test value is achieved, determine the 
temperature at which the plotted curve intersects the specified 
test value by graphical interpolation ( extrapolation is not 
permitted). Record this transition temperature to the nearest 
5 °F (3 °C). If the tabulated test results clearly indicate a 
transition temperature lower than specified, it is not necessary 
to plot the data. Report the lowest test temperature for which 
test value exceeds the specified value. 
27.2.1.4 Accept the test result if the determined transition 
temperature is equal to or lower than the specified value. 
27.2.1.5 If the determined transition temperature is higher 
than the specified value, but not more than 20 °F (12 °C) higher 
than the specified value, test sufficient samples in accordance 
with Section 26 to plot two additional curves. Accept the test 
results if the temperatures determined from both additional 
tests are equal to or lower than the specified value. 
27.3 When subsize specimens are permitted or necessary, or 
both, modify the specified test requirement according to Table 
9 or test temperature according to ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code, Table UG-84.2, or both. Greater energies or lower 
test temperatures may be agreed upon by purchaser and 
supplier. 
28. Records 
28.1 The test record should contain the following informa­
tion as appropriate: 
28.1.1 Full description of material tested (that is, specifica­
tion number, grade, class or type, size, heat number). 
28.1.2 Specimen orientation with respect to the material 
axis. 
28.1.3 Specimen size. 
28.1.4 Test temperature and individual test value for each 
specimen broken, including initial tests and retests. 
28.1.5 Test results. 
28.1.6 Transition temperature and criterion for its 
determination, including initial tests and retests.
