steel and, when heat treated, subjected to the same finishing treatment in 
a continuous furnace. When final heat treatment is done in a batch-type 
furnace, the lot shall include all those tubes which are heat treated in the 
same furnace charge. 
S5.3 The yield strength corresponding to a permanent offset 
of 0.2 % of the gauge length of the specimen or to a total 
extension of 0.5 % of the gauge length under load shall be 
determined. 
S6. Destructive Weld Tests 
S6. l Round tubing and tubing to be formed into other 
shapes when in the round form shall meet the following 
destructive weld tests. 
S6.2 Flattening Test-A test 4 to 6 in. [100 to 150 mm] in 
length shall be flattened between parallel plates with the weld 
90° from the direction of applied force (at the point of 
maximum bending) until opposite walls of the tubing meet. 
Except as allowed in S6.2.1, no opening in the weld shall take 
place until the distance between the plates is less than two 
thirds of the original outside diameter of the tubing. No cracks 
or breaks in the base metal shall occur until the distance 
between the plates is less than one third of the original outside 
diameter of the tubing, but in no case less than five times the 
thickness of the tubing wall. Evidence of lamination or burnt 
material shall not develop during the flattening process, and the 
weld shall not show injurious defects. 
S6.2.1 When low D-to-t ratio tubing is tested, because the 
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the 
-inside-surface-ar-the six arnitwelve o'clock-locmions, cracRs at" 
these locations shall not be cause for rejection if the D-to-t ratio 
is less than 10. 
S6.3 Flaring Test-A section of tube approximately 4 in. 
[100 mm] in length shall stand being flared with a tool having 
a 60° included angle until the tube at the mouth of the flare has 
been expanded 15 % of the inside diameter, without cracking 
or showing flaws. 
S6.4 In order to properly evaluate weld quality, the producer 
at his option may normalize the test specimen prior to testing. 
S6.5 Number of tests and retests: 
S6.5.1 Two flattening and two flaring tests shall be made 
from each lot as specified. Each tested specimen shall conform 
to the respective requirement (See Note Sl). 
S6.5.2 If the results of the testing do not conform to the 
requirements, retests shall be made on four additional 
specimens, each of which shall conform to the respective 
requirement.

S7. Hydrostatic Test Round Tubing 
S7.1 All tubing will be given a hydrostatic test calculated as 
follows: 
where: 
2St P=­ D 
P = minimum hydrostatic test pressure, psi or MPa, 
S = allowable fiber stress of 14 000 psi or 96.5 MPa, 
t = specified wall thickness, in. or mm, and 
D = specified outside diameter, in. or mm. 
S7 .2 The minimum hydrostatic test pressue shall be main­
tained for not less than 5 s. 
S8. Nondestructive Electric Test 
S8.l Each tube shall be tested with a nondestructive electric 
test in accordance with Practice E213, Practice E273, Practice 
E309, or Practice E570. It is the intent of this test to reject tubes 
containing injurious defects. 
S8.2 For eddy-current testing, the calibration tube shall 
contain, at the option of the producer, any one of the following 
discontinuities to establish a minimum sensitivity level for 
rejection. For welded tubing, they shall be placed in the weld 
if visible. 
S8.2.l Drilled Hole-A hole not larger than 0.031 in. [0.78 
mm] in diameter shall be drilled radially and completely 
through the tube wall, care being taken to avoid distortion of 
the tube wlille drilling. - -- - -
S8.2.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool or 
file with a ¼-in. [6.4-mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the tube. Said notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.101 mm], whichever is greater. 
S8.2.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.78 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
tube axis on the outside surface of the tube, to have a depth not 
exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.101 mm], whichever is greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
S8.3 For ultrasonic testing, the longitudinal calibration ref­
erence notches shall be at the option of the producer, any one 
of the three common notch shapes shown in Practice E213 or 
Practice E273. The depth of notch shall not exceed 12½ % of 
the specified wall thickness of the tube or 0.004 in. [0.101
