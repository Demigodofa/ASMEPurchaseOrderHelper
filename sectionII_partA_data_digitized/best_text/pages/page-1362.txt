SA-790/SA-790M (ASTM A790/A790M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
greater. The width of the notch shall not exceed twice the 
depth. Notches shall be placed on both the OD and ID surfaces. 
14.9.2 For Eddy-Current Testing, the reference standard 
shall contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following discontinuities: 
14.9.2.1 Drilled Hole-The reference standard shall contain 
three or more holes equally spaced circumferentially around 
the pipe and longitudinally separated by a sufficient distance to 
allow distinct identification of the signal from each hole. The 
holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the pipe 
wall, with care being taken to avoid distortion of the pipe while 
drilling. One hole shall be drilled in the weld, if visible. 
Alternately, the producer of welded pipe may choose to drill 
one hole in the weld and run the calibration standard through 
the test coils three times with the weld turned at 120° on each 
pass. The hole diameter shall vary with NPS as follows: 
NPS Designator Hole Diameter 
0.039 in. [1 mm] 
above ½ to 1 ¼ 0.055 in. [1.4 mm] 
above 1 ¼ to 2 0.071 in. [1.8 mm] 
above 2 to 5 0.087 In. [2.2 mm] 
above 5 0.106 in. [2.7 mm] 
14.9.2.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool 
or file with a ¼-in. [6.4-mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe. Said notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12 ½ % of the specified nominal wall thickness of 
the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.102 mm], whichever is greater. 
14.9.2.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. or less in 
width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the tube 
axis on the outside surface of the pipe to have a depth not 
exceeding 12 ½ % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.004 in., whichever is greater. The length of the notch shall be 
compatible with the testing method. 
More or smaller reference discontinuities, or both, may be 
used by agreement between the purchaser and the manufac­
turer. 
14.10 Standardization Procedure: 
14.10.1 The test apparatus shall be standardized at the 
beginning and end of each series of pipes of the same size 
(NPS or diameter and schedule or wall thickness, grade, and 
heat treatment condition), and at intervals not exceeding 4 h. 
More frequent standardization may be performed at the manu­
facturer's option or may be required upon agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
14.10.2 The test apparatus shall also be standardized after 
any change in test system settings, change of operator, equip­
ment repair, or interruption due to power loss, process shut­
down, or when a problem is suspected. 
14.10.3 The reference standard shall be passed through the 
test apparatus at the same speed and test system settings as the 
pipe to be tested. 
14.10.4 The signal-to-noise ratio for the reference standard 
shall be 2 ½ to 1 or greater. Extraneous signals caused by 
identifiable causes such as dings, scratches, dents, straightener 
marks, and so forth shall not be considered noise. The rejection 
amplitude shall be adjusted to be at least 50 % of full scale of 
the readout display. 
14.10.5 If upon any standardization, the rejection amplitude 
has decreased by 29 % (3 dB) of peak height from the last 
standardization, the pipe since the last calibration shall be 
rejected. The test system settings may be changed or the 
transducer(s), coil(s), or sensor(s) adjusted and the unit restan­
dardized. But all pipe tested since the last acceptable standard­
ization must be retested for acceptance. 
14.11 Evaluation of Impeifections: 
14.11.1 Pipes producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
lowest signal produced by the reference standard(s) shall be 
identified and separated from the acceptable pipes. The area 
producing the signal may be reexamined. 
14.11.2 Such pipes shall be rejected if the test signal was 
produced by imperfections that cannot be identified or was 
produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. These pipes 
may be repaired per Sections 12 and 13. To be accepted, a 
repaired pipe must pass the same non-destructive test by which 
it was rejected, and it must meet the minimum wall thickness 
requirements of this specification. 
14.11.3 If the test signals were produced by visual imper­
fections such as: (1) scratches, (2) surface roughness, (3) dings, 
(4) straightener marks, (5) cutting chips, (6) steel die stamps, 
(7) stop marks, or (8) pipe reducer ripple. The pipe may be 
accepted based on visual examination, provided the imperfec­
tion is less than 0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 12 ½%of the specified 
wall thickness (whichever is greater). 
14.11.4 Rejected pipe may be reconditioned and retested 
providing the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that 
required by this or the product specification. The outside 
diameter at the point of grinding may be reduced by the amount 
so removed. To be accepted, retested pipe shall meet the test 
requirement. 
14.11.5 If the imperfection is explored to the extent that it 
can be identified as non-rejectable, the pipe may be accepted 
without further test providing the imperfection does not en­
croach on the minimum wall thickness. 
15. Repair by Welding 
15.1 For welded pipe of size NPS 6 or larger with a 
specified wall thickness of 0.188 in. [4.8 mm] or more, weld 
repairs made with the addition of compatible filler metal may 
be made to the weld seam with the same procedures specified 
for plate defects in the section on Repair by Welding of 
Specification A999/ A999M. 
15.2 Weld repairs of the weld seam shall not exceed 20 % of 
the seam length. 
15.3 Except as allowed by 15.3.1, weld repairs shall be 
made only with the gas tungsten-arc welding process using the 
same classification of bare filter rod qualified to the most 
current AWS Specification A5.9 as the grade of pipe being 
repaired as given in Table 4. 
15.3.1 Subject to approval by the purchaser, it shall be 
permissible for weld repairs to be made with the gas tungsten­
arc welding process using a filler metal more highly alloyed 
than the base metal, if needed for corrosion resistance or other 
properties.
