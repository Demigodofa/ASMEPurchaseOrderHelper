ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-336/SA-336M (ASTM A336/A336M) 
S8. Forging Requirements 
S8.l Large drum forgings shall be made from solid cast 
ingots, punched, bored, or trepanned, or from hollow ingots 
cast in metal molds. The walls of the hollowed or hollow ingots 
shall be reduced in thickness at least one-half by forging on 
mandrels. 
S8.2 Drum forgings with one solid closed end may be 
hollow forged in closed dies or on a draw bench provided the 
metal is worked thoroughly. 
S8.3 Drum forgings, either with open ends or one solid 
closed end, may also be produced by hot extrusion provided 
the metal is worked thoroughly. 
S8.4 Small drum forgings may be made as solid forgings, 
subsequently bored, provided the purchaser agrees to this 
method of forging. The cross-sectional area of the solid 
forgings shall have a reduction by forging from that of the 
ingot in the ratio of not less than 3:1. 
S8.5 Small sections or component parts of pressure vessels, 
which are to be subsequently assembled to form drums, may be 
made by expanding on a mandrel under a press or hammer, by 
hot extrusion or by ring rolling methods, provided the wall 
thickness is reduced at least one-half in the process. 
S8.6 Heads or covers shall be forged as disks, upset from 
blocks cut from ingots or billets. The length of block before 
upsetting shall be at least twice the thickness of the as-forged 
head or cover. 
S9. Individual Forging 
S9.1 Forgings, whether identical or not identical, shall be 
produced individually. They shall not be forged in multiple and 
separated prior to or after heat treatment. 
S9.2 The shape and size of individual forgings shall be 
agreed between the manufacturer and the purchaser by means 
of a forging drawing or the purchase order. 
S10. Minimum Cooling Rate 
SlO.l For Grade P91 Type 2 material the heat treatment 
shall ensure that following austenitizing, the rate of cooling 
from 1650 °F to 900 °F [900 °C to 480 °C] is no slower than 
9 °F/2nin [5 °C/min].
