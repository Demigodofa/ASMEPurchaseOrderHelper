INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless Ferritic and Austenitic Alloy-Steel Boiler, 
Superheater, and Heat-Exchanger Tubes 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A213/A213M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1. 1 This specification 2 covers seamless ferritic and auste­
nitic steel boiler, superheater, and heat-exchanger tubes, des­
ignated Grades TS, TP304, etc. These steels are listed in Tables 
1 and 2. 
1.2 Grades containing the letter, H, in their designation, 
have requirements different from those of similar grades not 
containing the letter, H. These different requirements provide 
higher creep-rupture strength than normally achievable in 
similar grades without these different requirements. 
1.3 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter to 5 in. 
[127 mm] in outside diameter and 0.015 to 0.500 in. [0.4 to 
12.7 mm], inclusive, in minimum wall thickness or, if specified 
in the order, average wall thickness. Tubing having other 
diameters may be furnished, provided such tubes comply with 
all other requirements of this specification. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
l.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
