11.5 Preparation: 
11.5.1 Plates: 
11.5.1.1 Tension test specimens for plates ¾ in. [20 mm] 
and under in thickness shall be the full thickness of the plates. 
The test specimens shall conform to the requirements shown in 
Fig. 3 of Test Methods and Definitions A370 for either the 
1 ½-in. [40-mm] wide test specimen or the ½-in. [12.5-mm] 
wide test specimen. 
11.5.1.2 For plates up to 4 in. [100 mm] inclusive, in 
thickness, the use of 1 ½-in. [40-mm] wide test specimens, full 
thickness of the plate and conforming to the requirements 
shown in Fig. 3 of Test Methods and Definitions A370, shall be 
subject to the limitation that adequate testing machine capacity 
is available. 
11.5.1.3 For plates over¾ in. [20 mm] in thickness, except 
as permitted in 11.5.1.2, tension test specimens shall conform 
to the requirements shown in Fig. 4 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370 for the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] diameter test 
specimen. The axis of such test specimens shall be located 
midway between the center of thickness and the top or bottom 
surface of the plate. 
11.5.2 Shapes: 
11.5.2.1 Except where angles are tested in full section, 
tension test specimens for shapes¾ in. [20 mm] and under in 
thickness shall be the full thickness of the shape. Such test 
specimen shall conform to the requirements shown in Fig. 3 of 
13 
Test Methods and Definitions A370 for either the 1 ½-in. 
[40-mm] wide test specimen or the ½-in. [12.5-mm] wide test 
specimen. 
11.5.2.2 For shapes up to 5 in. [125 mm] inclusive, in 
thickness, the use of 1 ½-in. [40-mm] wide test specimens, full 
thickness of the shape and conforming to the requirements 
shown in Fig. 3 of Test Methods and Definitions A370, shall be 
subject to the limitation that adequate testing machine capacity 
is available. 
11.5.2.3 For shapes over¾ in. [20 mm] in thickness, except 
as permitted in 11.5.2.2, tension test specimens shall conform 
to the requirements shown in Fig. 4 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370 for the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] diameter test 
specimens. The axis of such test specimens shall be located 
midway between the center of thickness and the top or bottom 
surface of the shape. 
11.5.3 Bars: 
11.5.3.1 Except as otherwise provided below, test speci­
mens for bars shall be in accordance with Annex Al of Test 
Methods and Definitions A370. 
11.5.3.2 Except as provided in 11.5.3.5, test specimens for 
bars ¾ in. [20 mm] and under in thickness shall conform to the 
requirements shown in Fig. 3 of Test Methods and Definitions 
A370 for either the 1 ½-in. [40-mm] wide test specimen or the 
½-in. [12.5-mm] wide specimen. 
11.5.3.3 Except as provided in 11.5.3.4 and 11.5.3.5, test 
specimens for bars over¾ in. [20 mm] in thickness or diameter 
shall conform either to the requirements for the 1 ½-in. 
[40-mm] or ½-in. [12.5-mm] wide test specimen shown in Fig. 
3 of Test Methods and Definitions A370, or to the requirements 
for the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] diameter test specimen shown in 
Fig. 4 of Test Methods and Definitions A370.
