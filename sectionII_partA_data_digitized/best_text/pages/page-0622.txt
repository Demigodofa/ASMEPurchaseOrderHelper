6.3.1 Unless otherwise stated in the order, all pipe shall be 
furnished in the heat-treated condition in accordance with the 
requirements of Table 2. 
6.3.2 The purchase order shall specify one of the following 
conditions if the heat-treated condition specified in 6.3 .1 is not 
desired by the purchaser: 
6.3.2.1 A final heat-treatment temperature under 1900 °F 
[1040 °CJ-Each pipe supplied under this requirement shall be 
stenciled with the final heat-treatment temperature in degrees 
Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius after the suffix "HT." Controlled 
structural or special service characteristics may be specified as 
a guide for the most suitable heat treatment. 
6.3.2.2 DELETED 
6.3.2.3 DELETED 
6.4 A solution annealing temperature above 1950 °F [1065 
0 C] may impair the resistance to intergranular c01rnsion after 
subsequent exposure to sensitizing conditions in Grades 321, 
321H, 347, 347H, and 348. When specified by the purchaser, a 
lower temperature stabilization or re-solution anneal shall be 
used subsequent to the initial high temperature solution anneal 
(see Supplementary Requirement SS). 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 The chemical composition of the plate shall conform to 
the requirements of the applicable specification and grade 
listed in Specification A240/ A240M. 
7.2 Except for Grade S34751 and S34752, the chemical 
composition of the welding filler metal shall conform to the 
requirements of the applicable AWS specification for the 
corresponding grade shown in Table 1, or shall conform to the 
chemical composition specified for the plate in Specification 
A240/ A240M, or shall, subject to purchaser approval, be a 
filler metal more highly alloyed than the base metal when 
needed for corrosion resistance or other properties. Use of a 
filler metal other than that listed in Table 1 or conforming to the 
chemical composition specified for the plate in Specification 
A240/ A240M shall be rep01ted and the filler metal identified 
on the certificate of tests. When nitrogen and cerium are 
specified elements for the ordered grade, the method of 
analysis for these elements shall be a matter of agreement 
between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
7 .3 The chemical composition of the welding filler metal for 
Grade S34751 and S34752 shall conform to the chemical 
composition specified for the plate in Specification A240/ 
A240M. The method for analysis for nitrogen shall be a matter 
of agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
8. Permissible Variations in Dimensions 
8.1 Permissible Variations-The dimensions at any point in 
a length of pipe shall not exceed the following: 
8.1.1 Outside Diameter-Based on circumferential 
measurement, ±0.5 % of the specified outside diameter. 
8.1.2 Out-of-Roundness-Difference between major and mi­
nor outside diameters, 1 %. 
8.1.3 Alignment-Using a 10-ft [3-m] straightedge placed 
so that both ends are in contact with the pipe, Vs in. [3 mm] 
deviation from contact with the pipe.

0 Quenched in water or rapidly cooled by other means, at a rate sufficient to prevent reprecipitation of carbides, as demonstrable by the capability of passing Practices 
A262, Practice E. The manufacturer is not required to run the test unless it is specified on the purchase order (see Supplementary Requirement S7). Note that Practices 
A262 requires the test to be performed on sensitized specimens in the low-carbon and stabilized types and on specimens representative of the as-shipped condition for 
other types. In the case of low-carbon types containing 3 % or more molybdenum, the applicability of the sensitizing treatment prior to testing shall be a matter for 
negotiation between the seller and the purchaser.
