SA-414/SA-414M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Steel, Sheet, Carbon, and High-Strength, Low-Alloy for 
Pressure Vessels 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers hot-rolled carbon steel sheet 
for pressure vessels involving fusion welding or brazing. 
Welding and brazing technique is of fundamental importance 
and shall be in accordance with commercial practices. 
1.2 The following grades are included in this specification: 
Mechanical Requirements 
Yield Strength, min Tensile Strength, min 
Grade ksi MPa ksi MPa 
A 25 170 45 310 
B W ~ W ~ 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ 
D 35 240 60 415 
E M ~ ~ ~ 
F ~ ~ ro ~ 
G 45 310 75 515 
H 45 310 75 515 
1.3 Hot-rolled carbon steel sheet is generally furnished in 
cut lengths and to decimal thickness only. Coils may be 
furnished, provided tension test specimens are taken to repre­
sent the middle of the slab as required by 6.1.3. The purchaser 
should recognize this may require cutting the coils to obtain 
test samples and results in half-size coils. The sheet is 
furnished to the following size limits: 
Width, in. [mm] 
Thickness, in. [mm] Over 12 [Over 300] 
0.270 to 0.230 [7.0 to 6.0] sheet (coils only) 
Under 0.230 to 0.057 [6.0 to 1.5] sheet 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system shall 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.5 Tolerances are found in General Requirements Specifi­
cations A568/ A568M and A635/ A635M. The appropriate Gen­
eral Requirements specification is applied based on the thick­
ness and width of the product ordered. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
