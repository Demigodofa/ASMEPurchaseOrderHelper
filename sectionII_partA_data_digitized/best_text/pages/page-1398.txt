tensile test made on the starting material may be certification 
that the material of hot-finished fittings meets the tensile 
requirements of this specification provided the heat treatments 
are the same. For purposes of tensile, yield and elongation 
requirements listed in Table 3, the tensile specimen shall 
consist of base metal only. If the purchaser requires results, 
involving the weld, in addition to the base metal only results, 
then the S2 supplemental requirement of this specification shall 
be specified on the purchase order. When S2 is specified, the 
weld metal must meet only the minimum ultimate tensile 
strength of Table 3. 
9. Hardness Requirements 
9.1 Fittings shall not exceed the maximum hardness shown 
in Table 3. 
10. Dimensions 
10.1 The sizes, shapes, and dimensions of the fittings 
covered by ASME Bl6.9, ASME B16.ll, MSS SP-43, MSS 
SP-79, MSS SP-83, MSS SP-95, or MSS SP-97 shall be as 
specified in those standards. 
10.2 Fittings of size or shape differing from these standards, 
but meeting all other requirements of this specification, may be 
furnished in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S58 
of Specification A960/A960M. 
11. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
11.1 Fittings supplied under this specification shall be 
examined visually. Selected typical surface discontinuities 
shall be explored for depth. The fittings shall be free from 
smface discontinuities that penetrate more than 5 % of the 
specified nominal wall thickness, except as defined in 11.3 and 
11 .4, and shall have a workmanlike finish. 
11.2 Surface discontinuities deeper than 5 % of the specified 
nominal wall thickness, except as defined in 11.3 and 11.4, 
shall be removed by the manufacturer by machining or 
grinding to sound metal, and the repaired areas shall be well 
faired. The waJl thiclmess at all points shall be at least 87½ % 
of the specified nominal wall thickness, and the diameters at all 
points shall be within the specified limits. 
11.3 Surface checks (fish scale) deeper than 1/64 in. [0.4 mm] 
shall be removed. 
11.4 Mechanical marks deeper than 1/16 in. (1.6 mm] shall be 
rernoved. 
1 LS When the removal of a surface discontinuity reduces 
the wall thickness below 87½ % of the specified nominal wall 
thickness at any point, the fitting shall be subject to rejection or 
to repair as provided in 11.6. 
11.6 Repair by Welding: 
11.6.1 Repair welding, of the base metal by the manufac­
turer, is pem1issible for fittings made to the dimensional 
standards listed in HU or for other standard fittings made for 
stock. Prior approval of the purchaser is required to repair 
special fittings made to the purchaser's requirements. Repair 
by welding shall neither exceed 10 % of the outside surface 
area of the fitting nor 33 1/2 % of the nominal wall thickness. 
11.6.2 The welding procedure and welders shall be qualified 
in accordance with Specification A960/A960M. 
11.6.3 The alloy content (carbon, chromium, nickel, molyb­
denum, columbium, and titanium) of the deposited weld metal 
shall be within the same percentage range as permitted for the 
base metal. (Warning-When selecting the filler metal and 
welding procedure, consideration should be given to their 
effect on corrosion resistance in service.) 
11.6.4 Surface discontinuities deeper than 5 % of the speci­
fied nominal wall thickness shall be removed by mechanical 
means or thermal cutting or gouging methods. Cavities pre­
pared for welding shall be examined by the liquid penetrant 
method of Practice E165. No cracks shall be permitted in the 
prepared cavities. 
11.6.5 The weld repair shall be permanently identified with 
the welder's stamp or symbol in accordance with Specification 
A960/ A960M. 
11.6.6 Weld repair area(s) shall be blended uniformly to the 
base metal and shall be examined by liquid penetrant in 
accordance with Practice El65. No cracks shall be permitted in 
the weld or surrounding ½ in. [13 mm] of base metal. 
11.6.7 After weld repair, material shall be heat treated in 
accordance with Section 6. 
11.7 The fittings shall be cleaned free of scale.
