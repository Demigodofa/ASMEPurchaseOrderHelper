cation shall conform to the dimensions and tolerances given in 
the latest revision of ASME B16.9. Steel socket-welding and 
threaded fittings purchased in accordance with this specifica­
tion shall conform to the sizes, shapes, dimensions, and 
tolerances specified in the latest revision of ASME Bl6.11, 
MSS-SP-79, or MSS-SP-83. Swage(d) Nipples, Bull Plugs,

chased in accordance with this specification shall conform to 
the sizes, shapes, dimensions, and tolerances specified in the 
latest revision of MSS-SP-95 or MSS-SP-97. 
14.2 Fittings of size or shape differing from these standards, 
but meeting all other requirements of this specification may be 
furnished in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S58 
in Specification A960/ A960M. 
15. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion 
Protection 
15.1 The requirements of Specification A960/A960M apply. 
16. Repair by Welding 
16.1 See Specification A960/A960M. 
16.2 In addition to the requirements for weld repair of 
Specification A960/ A960M, weld repairs to WP91 Type 1 and 
Type 2 fittings shall meet the requirements of 7.3.1. 
16.3 In addition to the requirements for weld repair of 
Specification A960/ A960M, weld repairs to WP24 fittings 
shall meet the requirements of 9.5. The recommended preheat 
and interpass temperature ranges are 200 to 400 °F [95 to 205 
0 C]. Weld repairs to WP24 fittings shall be post weld heat 
treated at 1350 to 1470 °F [730 to 800 °C], except that preheat 
and post weld heat treatment are not required for WP24 fittings 
whose section thickness does not exceed 0.500 in. [12.7 mm]. 
17. Inspection 
17.1 See Specification A960/A960M. 
17 .2 Other tests, when required by agreement, shall be made 
from material of the lots covered in the order. 
18. Rejection and Rehearing 
18.1 Material that fails to conform to the requirements of 
this specification may be rejected. Rejection should be reported 
to the producer or supplier promptly in writing. In case of 
dissatisfaction with the results of the tests, the producer or 
supplier may make claim for a rehearing. 
18.2 Fittings that develop defects in shopworking or appli­
cation operations may be rejected. Upon rejection, the manu­
facturer shall be notified promptly in writing. 
19. Certification 
19 .1 Test reports are required for all fittings covered by this 
specification. Each test report shall meet the requirements for 
certification in A960/ A960M as well as include the following 
information specific to this specification: 
19.1.1 Chemical analysis results, Section 9 (Table 1), re­
ported results shall be to the same number of significant figures 
as the limits specified in Table 1 for that element. 
19.1.2 Tensile property results, Section 10 (Table 2), report 
the yield strength and tensile strength in ksi [MPa] and 
elongation in percent,
