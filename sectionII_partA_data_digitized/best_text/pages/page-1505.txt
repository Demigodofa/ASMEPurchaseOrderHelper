NOTE 1 - These ratings are based on the physical width and 
continuity of the precipitate pattern developed by the acid etchant 
on the primary austenitic grain boundaries of the cast steel. Supple­
mentary testing is normally conducted to determine the final dispo­
sition of castings with ratings of 5 or greater.
