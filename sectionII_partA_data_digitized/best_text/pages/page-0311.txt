Xl. STRAIN HARDENING OF AUSTENITIC STEELS 
Xl.1 Strain hardening is the increase in strength and hard­
ness that results from plastic deformation below the recrystal­
lization temperature (cold work). This effect is produced in 
austenitic stainless steels by reducing oversized bars to the 
desired final size by cold drawing or other process. The degree 
of strain hardening achievable in any alloy is limited by its 
strain hardening characteristics. In addition, the amount of 
strain hardening that can be produced is further limited by the 
variables of the process, such as the total amount of cross-
section reduction, die angle and bar size. In large diameter bars, 
for example, plastic deformation will occur principally in the 
outer regions of the bar, so that the increased strength and 
hardness due to strain hardening is achieved predominantly 
near the surface of the bar. That is, the smaller the bar, the 
greater the penetration of strain hardening. Thus, the mechani­
cal properties of a given strain hardened bolting component are 
dependent not just on the alloy, but also on the size of bar from 
which it is machined. 
X2. COATINGS AND APPLICATION LIMITS 
X2.l Use of coated bolting components at temperatures 
above approximately one-half the melting point (Fahrenheit or 
Celsius) of the coating is not recommended unless consider­
ation is given to the potential for liquid and solid metal 
embrittlement, or both. The melting point of elemental zinc is 
approximately 780 °F [415 °C]. Therefore, application of zinc 
coated bolting components should be limited to temperatures 
less than 390 °F [210 °C]. The melting point of cadmium is 
approximately 600 °F [320 °C]. Therefore, application of 
cadmium coated bolting components should be limited to 
temperatures less than 300 °F [160 °C].
