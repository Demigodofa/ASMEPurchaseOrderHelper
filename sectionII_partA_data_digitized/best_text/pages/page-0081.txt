SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following standardized supplementary requirements are for use when desired by the purchaser. 
Those that are considered suitable for use with each material specification are listed in the 
specification. Other tests may be performed by agreement between the supplier and the purchaser. 
These additional requirements shall apply only when specified in the order, in which event the 
specified tests shall be made by the manufacturer or processor before shipment of the material.

·s3.l Prior to testing, the test specimens representing the 
structural product for acceptance purposes for mechanical 
properties shall be thermally treated to simulate a post-weld 
heat treatment below the critical temperature (Ac 3 ), using the 
heat treatment parameters (such as temperature range, time,
