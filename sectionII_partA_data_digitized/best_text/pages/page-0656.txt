Norn 2-On subsize specimens, all dimensions and tolerances of the 
standard specimen remain constant with the exception of the width, which 
vaties as shown above and for which the tolerance shall be ± 1 %. 
(b) Standard Subsize Specimens 
FIG. 11 Charpy (Simple Beam) Impact Test Specimens 
23.2.2.4 Tolerances for standard subsize specimens are 
shown in Fig. 11. Standard subsize test specimen sizes are: 
10 x 7.5 mm, 10 x 6.7 mm, 10 x 5 mm, 10 x 3.3 mm, and 
10 x2.5 mm. 
23.2.2.5 Notch the narrow face of the standard subsize 
specimens so that the notch is perpendicular to the 10 mm wide 
face. 
23.3 Notch Preparation-The machining (for example, 
milling, broaching, or grinding) of the notch is critical, as 
minor deviations in both notch radius and profile, or tool marks 
at the bottom of the notch may result in variations in test data, 
particularly in materials with low-impact energy absorption. 
(see Annex AS). 
24. Calibration 
24.1 Accuracy and Sensitivity-Calibrate and adjust Charpy 
impact machines in accordance with the requirements of Test 
Methods E23. 
25. Conditioning-Temperature Control 
25.1 When a specific test temperature is required by the 
specification or purchaser, control the temperature of the 
heating or cooling medium within ±2 °F (1 °C). 
Norn 17-For some steels there may not be a need for this restticted 
temperature, for example, austenitic steels. 
Norn 18-Because the temperature of a testing laboratory often varies 
from 60 to 90 °F (15 to 32 °C) a test conducted at "room temperature" 
might be conducted at any temperature in this range . 
26. Procedure 
26.l Temperature: 
26.1.1 Condition the specimens to be broken by holding 
them in the medium at test temperature for at least 5 min in 
liquid media and 30 min in gaseous media. 
26.1.2 Prior to each test, maintain the tongs for handling test 
specimens at the same temperature as the specimen so as not to 
affect the temperature at the notch. 
26.2 Positioning and Breaking Specimens: 
26.2.1 Carefully center the test specimen in the anvil and 
release the pendulum to break the specimen. 
26.2.2 If the pendulum is not released within 5 s after 
removing the specimen from the conditioning medium, do not 
break the specimen. Return the specimen to the conditioning 
medium for the period required in 26.1.1. 
26.3 Recovering Specimens-In the event that fracture ap­
pearance or lateral expansion must be determined, recover the 
matched pieces of each broken specimen before breaking the 
next specimen. 
26.4 Individual Test Values: 
26.4.1 Impact Energy-Record the impact energy absorbed 
to the nearest ft· lbf (J).

26.4.2 Fracture Appearance: 
26.4.2.1 Determine the percentage of shear fracture area by 
any of the following methods: 
(I) Measure the length and width of the brittle portion of 
the fracture surface, as shown in Fig. 13 and determine the 
percent shear area from either Table 7 or Table 8 depending on 
the units of measurement. 
(2) Compare the appearance of the fracture of the specimen 
with a fracture appearance chart as shown in Fig. 14. 
(3) Magnify the fracture surface and compare it to a 
precalibrated overlay chart or measure the percent shear 
fracture area by means of a planimeter. 
(4) Photograph the fractured surface at a suitable magnifi­
cation and measure the percent shear fracture area by means of 
a planimeter. 
26.4.2.2 Determine the individual fracture appearance val­
ues to the nearest 5 % shear fracture and record the value. 
26.4.3 Lateral Expansion: 
26.4.3.1 Lateral expansion is the increase in specimen 
width, measured in thousandths of an inch (mils), on the 
compression side, opposite the notch of the fractured Charpy 
V-notch specimen as shown in Fig. 15. 
26.4.3.2 Examine each specimen half to ascertain that the 
protrusions have not been damaged by contacting the anvil, 
machine mounting smface, and so forth. Discard such samples 
since they may cause erroneous readings. 
26.4.3.3 Check the sides of the specimens perpendicular to 
the notch to ensure that no burrs were formed on the sides 
during impact testing. If burrs exist, remove them carefully by 
rubbing on emery cloth or similar abrasive surface, making 
sure that the protrusions being measured are not rubbed during 
the removal of the burr.
