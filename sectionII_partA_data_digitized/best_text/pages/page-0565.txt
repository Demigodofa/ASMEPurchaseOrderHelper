13. Nondestructive Examination 
13.1 When required by 12.1.2 or 12.2 above, or when 
specified in the purchase order in addition to the hydrostatic 
test (12.2.3), each pipe shall be examined by a nondestructive 
examination method in accordance with Practice E213, Prac­
tice E309, or Practice E570. Except for Grades P91 Type 1 and 
Type 2, P92, P93, P115, P911, Pl22, and P128, the type of 
nondestructive examination shall be at the option of the 
manufacturer, unless otherwise specified in the order. Grades 
P91 Type 1 and Type 2, P92, P115, P911, P122, and P128 shall 
be examined by an examination method in accordance with 
Practice E213. When specified in the order, pipe of Grades P91 
Type 1 and Type 2, P92, P93, P115, P911, P122, and P128 shall 
be examined by an examination method in accordance with 
Practices E309 or E570, in addition to the examination method 
in accordance with Practice E213. The range of pipe sizes that 
may be examined by each method shall be subject to the 
limitations in the scope of the respective practices. 
13.2 Following conditions apply in lieu or in addition to 
those in Specification A999/A999M: 
13.2.1 The width of the notch shall not exceed the depth. 
13.2.2 If upon any standardization, the reference signal 
amplitude has decreased by more than 25 % (2 db), the test 
apparatus shall be considered out of standardization. The test 
system settings may be changed, or the transducer(s), coil(s) or 
sensor(s) adjusted, and the unit restandardized, but all pipe 
tested since the last acceptable standardization shall be re­
tested. 
13.2.3 Pipes producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
signal produced by the reference standard shall be subject to 
one of the following four dispositions: 
13.2.3.1 The pipes may be rejected without further 
examination, at the discretion of the manufacturer. 
13.2.3.2 The pipes shall be rejected if the test signal was 
produced by imperfections which cannot be identified, or was 
produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. 
13.2.3.3 The pipes may be repaired by grinding (in accor­
dance with 7.2.1), welding (in accordance with 7.6) or section­
ing (in accordance with 7.2.3). To be accepted, a repaired pipe 
must pass the same nondestructive examination by which it 
was rejected, and it must meet the remaining wall thickness 
requirements of this specification. 
13.2.3.4 If the test signals were produced by visual imper­
fections such as those listed below, the pipes may be evaluated 
in accordance with the provisions of Section 7: 
( a) Scratches, 
(b) Surface roughness, 
(c) Dings, 
( d) Straightener marks, 
( e) Cutting chips, 
(f) Steel die stamps, 
( g) Stop marks, or 
(h) Pipe reducer ripple. 
14. Mechanical Tests Required 
14.1 Lot-For mechanical testing, a lot is all pipe of the 
same nominal size and wall thickness ( or schedule) which is 
produced from the same heat of steel and subjected to the same 
finishing treatment in a continuous furnace; when final heat 
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, the lot shall include only 
that pipe which is heat treated in the same furnace charge. 
14.2 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test and Flatten­
ing or Bend Test-For material heat treated in a batch-type 
furnace, tests shall be made on 5 % of the pipe from each 
treated lot. For small lots, at least 1 pipe shall be tested. For 
material heat treated by the continuous process, tests shall be 
made on a sufficient number of pipe to constitute 5 % of the lot, 
but in no case less than 2 pipe. Unless otherwise specified, the 
flattening test or bend test shall be chosen at the manufacturer's 
option.

14.3 Hardness Test: 
14.3.1 The Vickers hardness testing shall be made in accor­
dance with Test Method E92. 
14.3.2 For pipes with wall thickness 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] or 
over, either the Brinell or Rockwell hardness test shall be used. 
When Brinell hardness testing is used, a 10-mm ball with 3000, 
1500, or 500-kg load shall be used at the option of the 
manufacturer. 
14.3.3 For pipes with wall thickness 0.065 in. [1.7 mm] or 
over, but less than 0.200 in. [5.1 mm], the Rockwell hardness 
test shall be used. 
14.3.4 For pipes with wall thickness less than 0.065 in. [1.7 
mm], the hardness test shall not be required. 
14.3.5 The Brinell test shall be made, at the option of the 
manufacturer, on the outside of the pipe near the end, on the 
outside of a specimen cut from the pipe, or on the wall cross 
section of a specimen cut from the pipe. This test shall be made 
so that the center of the impression to the edge of the specimen 
is at least 2.5 times the diameter of the impression. 
14.3.6 The Rockwell hardness test shall, at the option of the 
manufacturer, be made on the inside surface, on the wall cross 
section, or on a flat of the outside surface. 
14.3.7 For pipe of Grades P23, P24, P36, P91 Type 1 and 
Type 2, P92, P93, P115, Pl22, P128, and P911, Brinell,
