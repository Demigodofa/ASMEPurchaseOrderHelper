SA-747 /SA-747M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR STEEL CASTINGS, STAINLESS, 
PRECIPITATION HARDENING 
SA-747/SA-747M 
Odentical with ASTM Specification A 747 / A 747M-04 except for the revision of the mandatory ordering requirements of para. 4.1.6 and the 
mandatory use of Supplementary Requirement SIS of SA-781/SA-781M.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers iron-chromium-nickel­
copper corrosion-resistant steel castings, capable of being 
strengthened by precipitation hardening heat treatment. 
1.2 These castings may be used in services requiring 
corrosion resistance and high strengths at temperatures up 
to 600°F [315°C]. They may be machined in the solution­
annealed condition and subsequently precipitation hard­
ened to the desired high-strength mechanical properties 
specified in Table Sl4.l with little danger of cracking or 
distortion. 
1.3 The material is not intended for use in the solution­
annealed condition. 
NOTE 1 - If the service environment in which the material is to be 
used is considered conducive to stress-corrosion cracking, precipitation 
hardening should be performed at a temperature that will minimize the 
susceptibility of the material to this type of attack. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification.

3. General Conditions for Delivery 
3.1 Material furnished to this specification shall be in 
accordance with the requirements of Specification 
A 781/ A 781M, including any supplementary require­
ments that are indicated in the purchase order. Failure 
to comply with the general requirements of Specification 
A 781/ A 781M constitutes nonconformance with this 
specification. In case of conflict between the requirements 
of this specification and Specification A 781 / A 78 lM, this 
specification shall prevail. 
4. Ordering Information

forth), Table 2, 
4.1.3 Drawing or pattern, 
4.1.4 Options in the specification, if any, in accor­
dance with 5.2, 6.3, and Section 7, and 
4.1.5 Supplementary requirements, if any, including 
the standards of acceptance. 
4.1.6 Supplementary Requirements S6, S 14, and S27 
are mandatory, together with S15 from Specification
