ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-747 /SA-747M 
SA-781/SA-781M, and must be specified in the purchase 
order, 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 The steel shall be made by the electric furnace 
process with or without separate refining such as argon­
oxygen decarburization (AOD). 
5.2 Heat Treatment- Castings may be given a homoge­
nization heat treatment in accordance with 5.2.1 at the 
producer's option or when specified by the purchaser (see 
S26) prior to solution heat treatment. All castings, whether 
homogenized or not, shall be given a solution treatment 
in accordance with 5.2.2 and unless ordered in the solution­
annealed condition shall be precipitation hardened to the 
ordered condition (Table 2). 
5.2.1 Homogenization heat treatment shall consist 
of heating the castings and test material to a minimum of 
1900°F [1040°], holding for a minimum of 11/z h, and 
cooling to below 90°F [30°C]. 
5.2.2 Solution annealing heat treatment shall consist 
of heating the castings and test material to 1925°F ± 50°F 
[1050°C ± 30°C], holding the 30 min/in. [1.2 min/mm] of 
section but not less than 30 min, and cooling to below 
90°F [30°C]. 
5.2.3 Temperature used for precipitation hardening 
shall be maintained within the range of± 25°F [± l5°C] 
of that listed in Table 2 for the heat-treatment condition 
ordered. (See Note 1). 
5.2.4 When the order of contract specifies a mini­
mum columbium content, the minimum precipitation hard­
ening temperature shall be 925°F [495°C]. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall be in accordance with the require­
ments as to chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
6.2 When the H900 condition is ordered, the minimum 
columbium content (Table 1) shall not apply. It is recom­
mended that columbium other than that in revert material 
not be added. 
6.3 Methods of Analysis - Analytical procedures for 
nitrogen analysis are not included in Methods E 38 or Test 
Methods E 353, so if the contract or order specifies that 
the nitrogen content is to be reported, the method of analy­
sis shall be agreed upon by purchaser and producer. 
7. Repair by Welding 
7.1 Repairs shall be made only in one of the following 
conditions: homogenized, solution annealed, Hl 100, 
Hl 150, Hl 150M, Hl 150DBL, or stress relieved at 1150°F 
± 25°F [620°C ± 15°C] for a minimum of 4 h. 
7 .2 Castings welded in one of the aged conditions noted 
in 7 .1 shall be post weld heat treated by the same aging 
treatment used prior to welding, or, where necessary to 
meet mechanical property requirements, shall be solution 
annealed and aged after welding. Castings welded in the 
stress-relieved condition shall receive the specification heat 
treatment after welding.
