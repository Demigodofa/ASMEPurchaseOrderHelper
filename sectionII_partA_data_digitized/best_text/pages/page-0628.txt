INTERNATIONAi. 
Standard Specification for 
Carbon and Ferritic Alloy Steel Forged and Bored Pipe for 
High-Temperature Service 1 
This standard is issned under the fixed designation A369/ A369M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of odginal adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscdpt epsilon (e) indicates an editodal change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers heavy-wall carbon and alloy 
steel pipe (Note 1) made from turned and bored forgings and is 
intended for high-temperature service. Pipe ordered under this 
specification shall be suitable for bending and other forming 
operations and for fusion welding. Selection will depend on 
design, service conditions, mechanical properties and high­
temperature characteristics. 
NoTE 1-The use of the word "pipe" throughout the several sections of 
this specification is used in the broad sense and intended to mean pipe 
headers, or leads. 
NoTE 2-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diameter," "size," and '"nominal size." 
1.2 Several grades of ferritic steels are covered. Their 
compositions are given in Table 1. 
1.3 Supplementary requirements (S 1 to S7) of an optional 
nature are provided. Supplementary requirements S 1 to S5 call 
for additional tests to be made, and when desired shall be so 
stated in the order, together with the number of such tests 
required as applicable. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, 
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee 
A0l.10 on Stainless and Alloy Steel Tubular Products.
