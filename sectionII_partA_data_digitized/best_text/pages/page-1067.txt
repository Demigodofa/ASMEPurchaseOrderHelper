A 484/ A 484M), 
3.1.10 Special requirements (refer to 7.4 and 8.3), 
3.1.11 Marking requirements (Specification

ordered for a specific end use or uses. 
NOTE 3 -A typical ordering description is as follows: 5000 lb [2270 kg] 
Type 630, Solution-Annealed Cold Finished Centerless Ground, l½ in. 
[38.0 mm] round bar, 10 to 12 ft [3.0 to 3.6 m] in length, ASTM A 564 
dated ___ . End use: valve shafts. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 In addition to the requirements of this specification, 
all requirements of the current edition of Specifications 
A 484/ A 484M shall apply. Failure to comply with the 
general requirements of Specification A 484/ A 484M con­
stitutes nonconformance with this specification. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Heat Treatment and Condition: 
5.1.1 Material of types other than XM-16, XM-25, 
and Type 630 shall be furnished in the solution-annealed 
condition, or in the equalized and oven-tempered condition, 
as noted in Table 2, unless otherwise specified by the 
purchaser. 
5.1.1.1 Types 630, XM-16, and XM-25 may be 
furnished in the solution-annealed or age-hardened con­
dition. 
5.1.2 Type UNS S46910 shall be funished in solu­
tton-annealed-contlitiorr per-Tab-le--2-,or-solutcion-anne--aleEl­
and cold-worked condition per Table 3, or aged-hardened 
condition per Table 4. 
5.1.3 Reforging stock shall be supplied in a condition 
of heat treatment to be selected by the forging manufac­
turer. 
5.2 Shapes may be subjected to either Class A or 
Class C preparation as specified on the purchase order. 
5.2.1 Class A consists of preparation by grinding for 
the removal of imperfections of a hazardous nature such 
as fins, tears, and jagged edges provided the underweight 
tolerance is not exceeded and the maximum depth of grind­
ing at any one point does not exceed 10% of the thickness 
of the section. 
5.2.2 Class C consists of preparation by grinding for 
the removal of all visible surface imperfections provided 
the underweight tolerance is not exceeded and the maxi­
mum depth of grinding at any one point does not exceed 
10% of the thickness of the section. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 Each alloy covered by this specification shall con­
form to the chemical requirements specified in Table 1. 
6.2 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with 
Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A 751. 
7. Mechanical Properties Requirements 
7 .1 The material, as represented by mechanical test 
specimens, shall conform to the mechanical property 
requirements specified in Table 2 or Table 3 and shall be 
capable of developing the properties in Table 4 when heat 
treated as specified in 5 .1. 
7.2 Samples cut from bars for forging stock shall con­
form to the mechanical properties of Table 2 and Table 4 
when heat treated as specified in Table 2 and Table 4. 
7.3 The yield strength shall be determined by the offset 
method as described in the current edition of Test Methods 
and Definitions A 370. The limiting permanent offset shall 
be 0.2% of the gage length of the specimen. 
7.4 The impact requirement shall apply only when 
specified in the purchase order. When specified, the mate­
rial, as represented by impact test specimens, shall be capa­
ble of developing the impact property requirements 
specified in Table 4 when heat treated in accordance 
with 5.1. 
7.5 Longitudinal impact requirements are not applica­
ble to bars less than¾ in. (16.9 mm) diameter or size or 
_Jlat~les~than ¾ in. (16.9 mm) thick. 
967 
7.6 Tensile and impact requirements in the transverse 
(through thickness) direction are not applicable to bars less 
than 3 in. [7 5 mm] diameter in size or flats less than 3 in. 
[75 mm] thick. 
7.7 Material tensile tested and, when specified, impact 
tested in the transverse (through thickness) direction and 
meeting the requirements shown in Table 4 need not be 
tested in the longitudinal direction. 
8. Number of Tests 
8.1 At least one room temperature tension test and one 
or more hardness tests shall be made on each lot. 
8.2 One or more hardness tests and at least one tension 
test shall be made from each lot on test samples heat
