Xl. DETERMINATION OF TEMPERATURE 
REDUCTIONS 
Xl.1 Under the circumstances stated in 15 .4, the impact 
test temperatures specified in Table 6 must be lowered. 
The following examples are offered to describe the applica­
tion of the provisions of 15.4. 
Xl.1.1 When subsize specimens are used (see 14.1) 
and the width along the notch of the subsize specimen is 
80% or greater of the actual wall thickness of the original 
material, the provisions of 15.4 do not apply. 
Xl.1.1.1 For example, if the actual wall thickness 
of pipe was 0.200 in. [5.0 mm] and the width along the 
notch of the largest subsize specimen obtainable is 0.160 
in. [4 mm] or greater, no reduction in test temperature is 
required. 
503 
Xl.1.2 When the width along the subsize specimen 
notch is less than 80% of the actual wall thickness of the 
pipe, the required reduction in test temperature is computed 
by taking the difference between the temperature reduction 
values shown in Table 7 for the actual pipe thickness and 
the specimen width used. 
Xl.1.2.1 For example, if the pipe were 0.262 in. 
[6.67 mm] thick and the width along the Charpy specimen 
notch was 3.33 mm(½ standard size), the test temperature 
would have to be lowered by 25°F [l4°C] (that is, the 
temperature reduction corresponding to the subsize speci­
men is 35°F [l9°C], the temperature reduction correspond­
ing to the actual pipe thickness is 10°F [5°C]; the difference 
between these two values is the required reduction in test 
temperature).
