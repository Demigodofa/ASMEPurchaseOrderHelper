treated in accordance with the requirements of Table 3. Other than for Grades S30815, S30942, S31272, S33228, S30432, 
and H grades, seamless tubing immediately following hot forming may be individually quenched in water or rapidly cooled 
by other means ( direct quenched), provided that the temperature of the tubes after hot forming is not less than the 
minimum specified heat treatment temperatures. For H grades, as well as Grades S30815, S30942, S31272, S33228, and 
S30432, the tubes shall be reheated to the specified heat treatment temperature for the required time before quenching.
