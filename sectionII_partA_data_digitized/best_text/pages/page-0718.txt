SA-401/SA-401M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Steel Wire, Chromium-Silicon Alloy 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers round and shaped chromium­
silicon alloy steel spring wire having properties and quality 
intended for the manufacture of springs resistant to set when 
used at moderately elevated temperatures. This product is not 
meant to be used for non-static applications involving moder­
ate fatigue stresses ( see Specification A 1000/ A 1000M) or high 
cycle fatigue applications (see Specification A877/A877M). 
This wire shall be provided either in the annealed and 
cold 0 drawn or quench and tempered condition as specified by 
the purchaser. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.2.1 Within the text, the inch-pound units are shown in 
brackets. 
1.3 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3.1 Definitions: 
3.1.1 For definitions of terms used in this specification, see 
Terminology A941. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.1 equivalent round diameter, n-diameter of a round 
wire having equivalent cross sectional area to a given shaped 
wire. 
3.2.2 round wire, n-wire having a circular cross section. 
3.2.3 shape factor, n-this value is used to obtain cross 
sectional area for shaped wires when multiplied by measured 
width and thickness. 
3.2.4 shaped wire, n-wire having a non-circular cross 
section. 
4. Ordering Information
