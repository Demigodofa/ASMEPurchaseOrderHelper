ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-813 /SA-813M 
S3. Flattening Test 
S3.1 The flattening test of Specification A999/A999M shall 
be made on a specimen from one or both ends of each pipe. 
Crop ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is 
specified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. 
If a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility 
prior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening 
test requirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat­
ment in accordance with Specification A999/ A999M and 
satisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails 
because of a lack of soundness, that length shall be tested, 
unless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length 
is sound. 
S4. Etching Tests 
S4.1 The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching 
tests conducted in accordance with the appropriate portions of 
Method E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section 
from one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound 
welds and reasonably uniform material free of injurious 
laminations, cracks, and similar objectionable imperfections. If 
this supplementary requirement is specified, the number of 
tests per pipe required shall also be specified. If a specimen 
from any length shows objectionable imperfections, the length 
shall be rejected subject to removal of the defective end and 
subsequent retests indicating the remainder of the length to be 
sound and reasonably uniform material. 
SS. Radiographic Examination 
S5.l Weld soundness shall be determined through radio­
graphic examination made in accordance with requirements as 
agreed upon between the pipe manufacturer and purchaser. 
S6. Corrosion Requirements 
S6.1 Boiling Nitric Acid Test-Except for Grade TP 321, 
coupons representing finished pipe made of nonmolybdenum­
bearing material (0.50 % and less molybdenum) shall meet the 
requirements of Practice C of Practices A262. The condition of 
the test specimens and the corrosion rates are as follows: Types 
304L, 304LN, 347, and 348 shall be tested in the sensitized 
condition (heated for 1 h at 1240 °F [670 °C]) and the rate of 
penetration when the solution is tested in accordance with 
Practice C shall not exceed 0.0020 in. [0.05 mm] per month. 
All other nonmolybdenum-bearing types, except for Grade TP 
321, shown in Table 2, shall be tested in the annealed and 
unsensitized condition and the rate of penetration shall not 
exceed 0.0015 in. [0.038 mm] per month. 
S6.2 Acidified Copper Sulfate Test-Coupons representing 
finished pipe made of molybdenum-bearing material (over 
0.50 % molybdenum) and Type 321 shall meet the require­
ments of Practice E of Practices A262. The condition of the test 
specimen is as follows: Types 316L, 316LN, 317L, and 321 
shall be tested in the sensitized condition (heated for 1 h at 
1240 °F [670 °C]). All molybdenum-bearing types shown in 
Table 2 shall be tested in the annealed and unsensitized 
condition. All specimens shall meet the requirements of the 
prescribed bend tests.
