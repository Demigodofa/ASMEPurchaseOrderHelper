A Consult the manufacturer on forged bars, cold-finished bars, bored bars, 
seamless tubes, and forged hollows. 
13.1.1 One test coupon shall be removed from each end of 
one bar, one seamless tube, or one bored bar or from each of 
two forged hollows from each size of each heat in each 
tempering charge, or each 10 000 lb [4540 kg], whichever is 
less. One tension test and one impact test consisting of three 
Charpy V-notch specimens shall be taken from each test 
coupon. For testing in accordance with 15.1.1, two tests shall 
be obtained from two representative production pieces from 
each size of each heat in each tempering charge or each 10 000 
lb [4540 kg], whichever is less. 
13.1.2 Hardness Test: 
13.1.2.1 Bars 2 in. [50 mm] and over and all seamless tubes 
or bored bars shall be tested near each end of each mill-treated 
length. Each forged hollow with thickness 2 in. [50 mm] or 
over shall be tested on the surface. 
13.1.2.2 Bars under 2 in. [50 mm] shall be tested near each 
end of not less than 10 % of the bars. Forged hollows less than 
2 in. [50 mm] thick shall be tested on the surface of not less 
than 10 % of the forgings. 
13.2 Hardness Tests of Annealed Bolting Material: 
13.2.1 Hardness tests shall be made on the annealed bars to 
assure compliance with 10.2. 
13.3 Bolting Components: 
------13.3rTfie number of bolting components tested shall be as 
specified in Specification A962/ A962M. 
14. Retests 
14.1 If the results of the mechanical tests of any test lot do 
not conform to the specified requirements, the manufacturer 
shall reject the lot or the manufacturer may re-heat treat such 
a lot no more than twice. After the lot is re-heat treated, all of 
the tests specified in Section 13 shall be repeated, and all shall 
conform to the specified requirements. 
15. Test Specimens and Methods of Testing 
15.1 A discard equivalent to the diameter of the bar when 
heat treated as a solid or a discard equivalent to the wall 
thickness when heat treated as a seamless tube, bored bar, or 
hollow forging shall be taken prior to removal of test coupons. 
15.1.1 When production pieces are not of sufficient length to 
permit removal of test coupons in accordance with 15.1, the 
mid-length of the specimens shall be at the mid-length of the 
production pieces selected for destruction to provide test 
coupons of the bolting material. The production pieces selected 
for test shall be identical with respect to the quenched contour 
and size except for length which shall equal or exceed the 
length of the represented production pieces. 
15.2 Tension and impact specimens from bolting compo­
nents with cross sections of 1 ½ in. [38 mm] or less shall be 
taken so that their longitudinal axis is on a line representing the 
center of the diameter or thickness. 
15.3 Tension test specimens from bolting components with 
cross sections exceeding 1 ½ in. [38 mm] shall be taken so that 
their longitudinal axis is midway between mid-thickness and 
surface. 
15.4 Impact specimens from bolting components with cross 
sections exceeding 1 ½ in. [38 mm] shall be taken so that their 
longitudinal axis is midway between mid-thickness and surface 
or 1 in. [25 mm] below the surface plus the machining 
allowance per side, whichever is less. 
16. Certification 
16.1 When requested in the purchaser's order, a test report 
shall be furnished to the purchaser. In addition to the require­
ments of Specification A962/A962M the report shall include 
any other tests which may be specified in writing by the 
purchaser. 
17. Product Marking 
916 
17.1 Bars under 2 in. [50 mm] in diameter shall be bundled 
and tagged with the specification, grade symbol, and mill heat 
number. The specification number marked on the tag need not 
include specification year date and revision number. 
17.2 Bars 2 in. [50 mm] and over in diameter and all 
seamless tubes and bored bars shall be die-stamped with the 
11.1iU heat number and grade symbol on one surface. 
17 .3 Each hollow forging shall be die-stamped with the heat 
number or heat symbol code and grade symbol. 
17.4 See Specification A962/ A962M for marking bolting 
components. Use the grade symbol shown in Table 1.
