FIG. A2.8 Roller Chain Type Extensometer, Clamped 
Rockwell hardness test. When a comparison is made between 
Rockwell determinations made on the outside surface and 
determinations made on the inside surface, adjustment of the 
readings will be required to compensate for the effect of 
curvature. The Rockwell B scale is used on all materials having 
an expected hardness range of BO to B 100. The Rockwell C 
scale is used on material having an expected hardness range of 
C20 to C68. 
A2.4.4 Superficial Rockwell hardness tests are normally 
performed on the outside surface whenever possible and 
whenever excessive sp1ing back is not encountered. Otherwise, 
the tests may be perfonned on the inside. Superficial Rockwell 
hardness tests shall not be performed on tubes with an inside 
diameter of less than ¼ in. (6.4 mm). The wall thickness 
limitations for the Superficial Rockwell hardness test are given 
in Tables A2.1 and A2.2. 
A2.4.5 When the outside diameter, inside diameter, or wall 
thickness precludes the obtaining of accurate hardness values, 
tubular products shall be specified to tensile properties and so 
tested. 
A2.5 Manipulating Tests 
A2.5.1 The following tests are made to prove ductility of 
certain tubular products: 
A2.5.l.1 Flattening Test-The flattening test as commonly 
made on specimens cut from tubular products is conducted by 
subjecting rings from the tube or pipe to a presc1ibed degree of 
flattening between parallel plates (see Fig. A2.4). The severity 
of the flattening test is measured by the distance between the 
parallel plates and is varied according to the dimensions of the 
tube or pipe. The flattening test specimen should not be less 
than 2½ in. (63.5 mm) in length and should be flattened cold to 
the extent required by the applicable material specifications. 
A2.5 .1.2 Reverse Flattening Test-The reverse flattening 
test is designed primarily for application to electric-welded 
tubing for the detection of lack of penetration or overlaps 
resulting from flash removal in the weld. The specimen 
consists of a length of tubing approximately 4 in. (102 mm) 
long which is split longitudinally 90° on each side of the weld. 
The sample is then opened and flattened with the weld at the 
point of maximum bend (see Fig. A2.9).
