A For each reduction of 0.01 % carbon below 0.30 %, an increase of 0.05 % manganese above 1.06 % would be permitted to a maximum of 1.35 % manganese. 
8 Where an ellipsis ( ... ) appears in this table, there is no requirement and analysis for the element need not to be determined or reported. 
c By agreement between the manufacturer and the purchaser, the limit for columbium may be increased up to 0.05 % on heat analysis and 0.06 % on product analysis. 
addition of no filler metal in the welding operation. Grade 4 
shall be made by the seamless process. 
Norn 2-For electric-fusion-welded pipe, with filler metal added, 
fabricated of pressure vessel quality plates, see Specification A671. 
4.2 Grade 11 pipe may be produced by welding with or 
without the addition of filler metal. The following requirements 
shall apply for Grade 11 welded with the addition of filler 
metal. 
4.2. l The joints shall be full-penetration, full fusion double­
welded or single-welded butt joints employing fusion welding 
processes as defined in "Definitions," ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX. This specification makes no 
provision for any difference in weld quality requirements 
regardless of the weld joint type employed (single or double) in 
making the weld. Where backing strips are employed, the ring 
or strip material shall be the same as the plate being joined. 
Backing rings or strips shall be completely removed after 
welding, prior to any required radiography, and the exposed 
weld surface shall be examined visually for conformance to the 
requirements of 4.2.2. Welds made by procedures employing 
backing strips or rings which remain in place are prohibited. 
Welding procedures and welding operators shall be qualified in 
accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
Section IX. 
4.2.2 The weld surface on either side of the weld may be 
flush with the base plate or may have a reasonably uniform 
crown, not to exceed 1/s in. [3 mm]. Any weld reinforcement 
may be removed at the manufacturer's option or by agreement 
between the manufacturer and purchaser. The contour of the 
reinforcement shall be reasonably smooth and free from 
in-egularities. The deposited metal shall be fused uniformly 
into the plate surface. No concavity of contour is permitted 
unless the resulting thickness of weld metal is equal to or 
greater than the minimum thickness of the adjacent base metal. 
4.2.3 Radiographic Examination-All welded joints shall 
be fully radiographed in accordance with the requirements of 
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, 
Division 1, latest edition, paragraph UW-51. 
4.2.3.1 As an alternative, the welded joints may be ultra­
sonically examined in accordance with Appendix 12 of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 
l. 
4.2.4 Repair Welding-Weld metal defects shall be repaired 
by removal to sound metal and repair welding if approved by 
the purchaser. 
4.2.4. l The repair shall be blended smoothly into the 
surrounding base metal surface and examined by the magnetic 
particle examination in accordance with Practice E709, or by 
the liquid penetrant method in accordance with Practice E165. 
4.2.4.2 Each repair weld of a cavity where the cavity, before 
repair welding, has a depth exceeding the lesser of 1/s in. [9.5 
mm] or 10.5 % of the nominal thickness shall be radiographi­
cally examined as required for the original welds. 
4.2.5 Transverse Tension Test-One test shall be made to 
represent each lot (Note 3) of finished pipe. The test specimens 
shall be taken across the welded joint. The tension test results 
of the welded joints shall conform to the tensile properties for 
Grade 11 in Table 2. 
485 
4.2.5 .1 The test specimens shall be taken from the end of the 
finished pipe. As an alternative, the tension test specimens may 
be taken from a welded prolongation of the same material as 
the pipe, which is attached to the end of the pipe and welded as 
a ·prolongation of the pipe longitudinal seam. 
4.2.5.2 The test specimens shall be in accordance with 
Section IX, Part QW, paragraph QW-150 of the ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code and shall be one of the types shown 
in QW-462.l of that code. The tension test specimen may be 
flattened cold before final machining to size. 
4.2.6 Transverse Guided-Bend Weld Test-One transverse 
guided bend test (two specimens) shall be made to represent 
each lot (Note 3) of finished pipe. 
4.2.6.1 The two bend test specimens shall be taken from the 
weld at the end of the finished pipe. As an alternative, by 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, the test 
specimens may be taken from a test plate of the san1e material
