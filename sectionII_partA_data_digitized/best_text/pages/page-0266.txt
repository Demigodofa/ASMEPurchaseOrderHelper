6.5 Except as provided for in 6.4, the finished product shall 
be a forging as defined in the Terminology section of Specifi­
cation A788/A788M. 
7. Heat Treatment 6 
7 .1 After hot working, forgings shall be cooled to a tem­
perature below 1000 °F [538 °C] prior to heat treating in 
accordance with the requirements of Table 1. 
7.2 £ow Alloy Steels and Ferritic and Martensitic Stainless 
Steels-The low alloy steels and ferritic and martensitic 
stainless steels shall be heat treated in accordance with the 
requirements of 7 .1 and Table 1. When more than one heat 
treatment option is listed for a Grade in Table 1, any one of the 
heat treatments listed shall be performed. The selection of the 
heat treatment shall be at the manufacturer's option, unless 
otherwise stated in the purchase order. 
7.2.1 Liquid Quenching-Except as permitted in 7.2.2, for 
F 1, F 2, and F 3, and when agreed to by the purchaser, liquid 
quenching followed by tempering shall be permitted provided 
the temperatures in Table 1 for each grade are used. 
7.2.1.1 Marking-Parts that are liquid quenched and tem­
pered shall be marked "QT." 
7.2.2 Alternatively, Grade F 1, F 2, and F 12, Classes 1 and 
2 may be given a heat treatment of 1200 °F [650 °C] minimum 
after final hot or cold forming. 
7.3 Austenitic and Ferritic-Austenitic Stainless Steels­
Except as permitted by 7 .5, the austenitic and ferritic-austenitic 
stainless steels shall be heat treated and liquid-quenched in 
accordance with the requirements of 7 .1 and Table 1. 
7.3.1 Alternatively, immediately following hot working, 
while the temperature of the forging is not less than the 
minimum solution annealing temperature specified in Table 1, 
forgings made from austenitic grades (except grades F 304H, F 
309H, F 310, F 310H, F 316H, F 316Ti, F 321, F 321H, F 347, 
F 347H, F 348, F 348H, F 45, F35030, and F 56) may be 
individually rapidly quenched in accordance with the require­
ments of Table 1. Ferritic-austenitic grades may be solution 
annealed without cooling below 1000 °F by being re-heated to 
the solution annealing temperature required in Table 1, held for 
a time sufficient to dissolve phases and precipitates which may 
cause a reduction in corrosion or mechanical properties, and 
quenched in accordance with Table 1. 
7.3.2 See Supplementary Requirement S8 if a particular 
heat treatment method is to be employed. 
7.4 Time of Heat Treatment-Heat treatment of forgings 
may be performed before machining. 
7.5 Forged or Rolled Bar-Forged or rolled austenitic 
stainless bar from which cylindrically shaped parts are to be 
machined, as permitted by 6.4, and the parts machined from 
such bar, without heat treatment after machining, shall be 
furnished to the annealing and quenching or rapid-cooling 
6 A solution annealing temperature above 1950 °F [1065 °C] may impair the 
resistance to intergranular corrosion after subsequent exposure to sensitizing 
conditions in F 321, F 321H, F 347, F 347H, F 348, and F 348H. When specified 
by the purchaser, a lower temperature stabilizing treatment or a second solution 
annealing shall be used subsequent to the initial high temperature solution anneal 
(see Supplementary Requirement S10). 
requirements of Specification A484/A484M or this 
specification, with subsequent light cold drawing and straight­
ening permitted (see Supplementary Requirement S3 if anneal­
ing must be the final operation). 
7.6 Hollow Bar-Austenitic stainless hollow bar from 
which cylindrically shaped parts are to b~ machined, as 
permitted by 6.4, and the parts machined from such hollow bar, 
without heat treatment after machining, shall be furnished to 
the annealing and quenching or rapid-cooling requirements of 
Specification A511/ A511M, or this specification, with subse­
quent light cold drawing and straightening permitted (see 
Supplementary Requirement S3 if annealing must be the final 
operation). 
8. Chemical Composition 
8.1 A chemical heat analysis in accordance with Specifica­
tion A961/A961M shall be made and conform to the chemical 
composition prescribed in Table 2. 
8.2 Grades to which lead, selenium, or other elements are 
added for the purpose of rendering the material free-machining 
shall not be used. 
8 .3 Starting material produced to a specification that spe­
cifically requires the. addition of any element beyond those 
listed in Table 2 for the applicable grade of material is not 
perrni tted. 
8.4 Steel grades covered in this specification shall not 
contain an unspecified element, other than nitrogen in stainless 
steels, for the ordered grade to the extent that the steel 
conforms to the requirements of another grade for which that 
element is a specified element having a required minimum 
content. For this requirement, a grade is defined as an alloy 
described individually and identified by its own UNS designa­
tion or Grade designation and identification symbol in Table 2. 
8.5 Product Analysis-The purchaser may make a product 
analysis on products supplied to this specification in accor­
dance with Specification A961/A961M. 
9. Mechanical Properties 
9.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
mechanical properties for the grade ordered as listed in Table 3. 
9.2 Mechanical test specimens shall be obtained from pro­
duction forgings, or from separately forged test blanks pre­
pared from the stock used to make the finished product. In 
eithet case, mechanical test specimens shall not be removed 
until after all heat treatment is complete. If repair welding is 
required, test specimens shall not be removed until after 
post-weld heat treatment is complete, except for ferritic grades 
when the post-weld heat treatment is conducted at least 50 °F 
[30 °C] below the actual tempering temperature. When test 
blanks are used, they shall receive approximately the same 
working as the finished product. The test blanks shall be heat 
treated with the finished product and shall approximate the 
maximum cross section of the forgings they represent. 
9.3 For normalized and tempered, or quenched and tem­
pered forgings, the central axis of the test specimen shall be 
taken at least ¼ T from the nearest surface as-heat-treated,
