SA-352/SA-352M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Steel Castings, Ferritic and Martensitic, for Pressure­
Containing Parts, Suitable for Low-Temperature Service 
l. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers steel castings for valves, 
flanges, fittings, and other pressure-containing parts intended 
primarily for low-temperature service. 
1.2 Several grades of ferritic steels and one grade of 
martensitic steel are covered. Selection of analysis will depend 
on design and service conditions (Note). The temperature 
shown is the lowest temperature at which the material ordinar­
ily is required to meet the impact requirements of this 
specification (see Supplementary Requirement S22, Impact 
Test Temperatures). Users should note that hardenability of 
some of the grades mentioned may restrict the maximum size 
at which the required mechanical properties are obtainable (see 
Appendix Xl).

Norn 1--This specification covers the low-temperature requirements 
particularly pertinent for ferritic and rnartensitic steels. Certain of the 
grades of austenitic steel castings furnished in accordance with Specifi­
cation A351/ A351M have been found suitable for low-temperature service 
down to -300°F [-184"C] and others down to -425°F [-254°C]. These 
grades may be used when impact tested in accordance with Specification 
A352/A352M with energy levels and temperatures of test mutually agreed 
upon between the pnrchaser and the manufacturer. As a guide to the 
selection of e1i.ergy levels and testing temperatures, Appendix Xl should 
be consulted.

1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. Inch-pound units are applicable for material ordered to 
Specification A352 and SI units for material ordered to 
Specification A352M.

3. General Conditions for Delivery 
3.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A703/A703M including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase 
order. Failure to comply with the general requirements of 
Specification A 703/ A 703M constitutes nonconformance with
