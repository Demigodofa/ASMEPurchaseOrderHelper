SA-703/SA-703M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Steel Castings, General Requirements, for Pressure­
Containing Parts 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers a group of common require­
ments that, unless otherwise specified in an individual 
specification, shall apply to steel castings for pressure­
containing parts under each of the following ASTM specifica­
tions: 
Title of Specification ASTM Designation 
Steel Castings, Carbon, Suitable for Fusion Welding, A216/A216M 
for High-Temperature Service 
Steel Castings, Martensitic Stainless and Alloy, for A217/A217M 
Pressure-Containing Parts, Suitable for High-
Temperature Service 
Castings, Austenitic, for Pressure-Containing A351/A351 M 
Parts 
Steel Castings, Ferritic and Martensitic, for Pressure- A352/A352M 
Containing Parts, Suitable for Low-Temperature 
Service 
Steel Castings, Alloy, Specially Heat-Treated, for A389/A389M 
Pressure-Containing Parts, Suitable for High-
Temperature Service 
Steel Castings Suitable for Pressure Service A487/A487M 
Castings, Iron-Nickel-Chromium and Nickel A990/A990M 
Alloys, Specially Controlled for Pressure Retaining 
Parts for Corrosive Service 
Castings, Austenltic-Ferritic (Duplex) A995/A995M 
Stainless Steel, for Pressure-Containing Parts 
1.2 This specification also covers a group of supplementary 
requirements which may be applied to the above specifications 
as indicated therein. These are provided for use when addi­
tional testing or inspection is desired and apply only when 
specified individually by the purchaser in the order. 
1.3 In case of conflict between the requirements of the 
individual specification and this general specification, the 
former shall prevail. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the standard. 
l.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
