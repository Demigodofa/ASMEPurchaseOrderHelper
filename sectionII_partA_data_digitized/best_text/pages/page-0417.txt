thickness (usually 2 h or less). If more than 60 % of the 
base-metal thickness remains, the sample may be removed 
after 24 h. 
S7 .8 At the end of the test period, remove the samples from 
the solution, rinse with distilled water, and dry. 
S7.9 After exposure to the test solution, repeat the tube­
thickness measurement as in S7.6. If the thinning is not 
uniform across the width of the weld, then two sets of 
weld-metal measurement are required. One set of measure­
ments is to be taken along the centerline of the weld. The 
second set of measurements is to be taken in the thinnest area 
of the weld. 
S7 .10 Calculate the corrosion ratio, R, for both sections of 
the weld as follows in Eq 1: 
where: 
R= WO -w 
B 0 -B 
W 0 = average weld-metal thickness before the test, 
W = average weld-metal thickness after the test, 
B 0 = average base-metal thickness before the test, and 
B = average base-metal thickness after the test. 
S7.11 Acceptance Criteria: 
(1) 
S7 .11.1 The ratio of the thinnest section of the weld and 
adjacent heat affected zone versus the base metal shall be 
determined. The following ratios or alternatives are commonly 
specified: 
S7.ll.l.1 A corrosion ratio of 1.25 or less. If not specified 
by the purchase order, this is the default criteria. 
S7.ll.l.2 A corrosion ratio of 1.00 or less. 
S7.11.1.3 Alternative ratios may be agreed between the 
purchaser and supplier. 
S8. Special Applications 
S8.1 For special applications, such as hydraulic expansion 
of tubes into tube sheets, dimensions of the weld shape and 
thickness shall be per agreement between the purchaser and 
supplier. Tubes ordered to this requirement shall bear the 
additional marking of NB. 
S9. Additional Testing of Welded Tubing for ASME Re­
quirements 
S9.l. When this supplement is specified in the purchase 
order, in certain ASME applications it is permissible to use 
100 % joint efficiency for longitudinal weld, provided the 
following additional requirements are met: 
S9.l.1 Each tube shall be subjected to an ultrasonic inspec­
tion employing Practices E273 or E213 with the rejection 
criteria referenced in Specification A1016/Al016M. 
S9.l.2 If Practice E273 is employed, a 100 % volumetric 
inspection of the entire length of each tube shall also be 
performed using one of the nondestructive electric tests per­
mitted by Specification A1016/A1016M. 
S9.l.3 The test methods described in the supplement may 
not be capable of inspecting the end portions of tubes. This 
condition is referred to as end effect. This portion, as deter­
mined by the manufacturer, shall be removed and discarded. 
S9.l.4 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A1016/Al016M, "S9" shall be added after the grade designa­
tion. 
ND'rE S9.1-When specified, the special testing in this supplement is 
intended for special ASME applications. It is not mandatory for all ASME 
applications.
