axially tested. Fracture on full size tests shall be in the body or 
threads of the fastener without a fracture at the junction of the 
head and body. 
11.3 Studs shall be tested by the axial tension method as 
described in the second paragraph of axial tension testing of 
full size products in the Test Methods section of Test Methods 
F606. 
11.4 Proof load shall be determined using Method 1, length 
measurement, or Method 2, yield strength, at the option of the 
manufacturer. 
12. Inspection 
12.1 If the inspection described in 12.2 is required by the 
purchaser, it shall be specified in the inquiry and contract or 
order. 
12.2 The purchaser's representative shall have free entry to 
all parts of the manufacturer's works or supplier's place of 
business that concern the manufacture or supply of the fasten­
ers. The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's representa­
tive all reasonable facilities to satisfy him that the fasteners are 
being furnished in accordance with this specification. All tests 
and inspections required by the specification that are requested 
by the purchaser's representative shall be made before 
shipment, and shall be conducted as not to interfere unneces-

13. Rejection and Rehearing 
13.l Disposition of nonconforming fasteners shall be in 
accordance with the section on Disposition of Nonconforming 
Lots of Guide F1470. 
14. Certification 
14.1 When specified on the purchase order, the manufac­
turer or supplier, whichever is the responsible party as defined 
in Section 15, shall furnish the purchaser test reports which 
include the following: 
14.1.1 Heat analysis, heat number, and a statement ce1iify­
ing that heats having the elements listed in 6.4 intentionally 
added were not used to produce the fasteners, 
14.1.2 Results of hardness, tensile, and proof load tests, 
14.1.3 Zinc coating measured coating weight/thickness for 
coated fasteners, 
14.1.4 Statement of compliance with dimensional and 
thread fit requirements, 
14.1.5 Lot number and purchase order number, 
14.1.6 Complete mailing address of responsible party, and 
14.1.7 Title and signature of the individual assigned certi-
fication responsibility by the company officers. 
14.2 Failure to include all the required information on the 
test report shall be cause for rejection. 
15. Responsibility 
15.1 The party responsible for the fastener shall be the 
organization that supplies the fastener to the purchaser.
