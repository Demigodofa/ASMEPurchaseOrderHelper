SA-450 /SA-450M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
General Requirements for Carbon and Low Alloy Steel 
Tubes 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers a group of requirements 
which, with the exceptions of 6.3 and Sections 7, 8, 19, 20, 21, 
22, 23, 24, and 25, are mandatory requirements to the follow­
ing ASTM tubular product specifications: 
Title of Specification ASTM DesignationA 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Carbon Steel and Carbon- A 178/ A 178M 
Manganese Steel Boiler Tubes 
Seamless Cold-Drawn Low-Carbon Steel Heat- A179/A179M 
Exchanger and Condenser Tubes 
Seamless Carbon Steel Boiler Tubes for High-Pressure A 192/A 192M 
Service 
Seamless Medium-Carbon Steel Boiler and Super- A210/A210M 
heater Tubes 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Carbon Steel Heat- A214/A214M 
Exchanger and Condenser Tubes 
Seamless and Electric-Welded Low-Alloy Steel Tubes A423/A423M 
Specification for Seamless and Welded Carbon Steel A498/A498M 
Heat-Exchanger Tubes with Integral Fins 
Seamless Cold-Drawn Carbon Steel Feedwater Heater A556/A556M 
Tubes 
Seamless, Cold-Drawn Carbon Steel Tubing for Hy­
draulic System Service 
A822/A822M 
A These designations refer to the latest issue of the respective specifications. 
1.2 One or more of Sections 6.3, 7, 8, 19, 20, 21, 22, 22.1, 
24, and 25 apply when the product specification or purchase 
order has a requirement for the test or analysis described by 
these sections. 
1.3 In case of conflict between a requirement of the product 
specification and a requirement of this general requirement 
specification only the requirement of the product specification 
need be satisfied. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
738 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation (SI) of the product specification is specified in the 
order. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
