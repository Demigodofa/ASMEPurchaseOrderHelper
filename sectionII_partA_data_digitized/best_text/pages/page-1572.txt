the thickness tolerance tables in Specifications A568/A568M and A749/ 
A749M. The purchaser should contact the producer prior to placing an 
order. 
5.1.7 Coil size (inside diameter, outside diameter, and maxi-
mum weight), 
5.1.8 Copper bearing steel (if required), 
5.1.9 Quantity, 
5.1.10 Application (part identification and description), 
5.1.11 A report of heat analysis will be supplied, if 
requested, for CS, DS and SFS. For materials with required 
mechanical properties, SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS, a 
report is required of heat analysis and mechanical properties as 
determined by the tension test, and 
5.1.12 Special requirements (if any). 
5.1.12.1 When the purchaser requires thickness tolerances 
for 3/s in. [10 mm] minimum edge distance (see Supplementary 
Requirement in Specification A568/A568M), this requirement 
shall be specified in the purchase order or contract. 
5.1.12.2 Tighter requirements can be specified based on 
agreement between seller and purchaser. 
NoTE 2-A typical ordering description is as follows: ASTM AlOll­
XX, hot rolled steel sheet, CS Type A, pickled and oiled, cut edge, 0.075 
by 36 by 96 in., 100 000 lb, for part no. 6310, for shelf bracket. 
Or, ASTM AlOl lM-XX, hot rolled steel sheet, CS Type B, pickled and 
oiled, cut edge, 3.7 by 117 mm by coil, ID 600 mm, OD 1500 mm, max 
weight 10 000 kg, 50 000 kg, for upper control arm. 
6. General Requirements for Delivery 
6.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A568/A568M for sheets and Specification A749/ 
A749M for strip, unless otherwise provided for herein. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 The heat analysis of the steel shall conform to the 
chemical composition requirements of the appropriate desig­
nation shown in Table 1 for CS, DS and SFS, and Table 2 for 
SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS. 
7 .1.1 A report of heat analysis will be supplied, if requested, 
for CS and DS. For materials with required mechanical 
properties, SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS, a report of heat 
analysis is required. 
7.2 Each of the elements listed in Table 1, Table 2, and 
Specification A568/ A568M Table X2.3 shall be included in the 
report of the heat analysis. When the amount of copper, nickel, 
chromium, or molybdenum is less than 0.02 %, report the 
analysis as <0.02 % or the actual determined value. When the 
amount of vanadium, columbium, or titanium is less than 
0.008 %, report the analysis as <0.008 % or the actual deter­
mined value. When the amount of boron is less than 0.0005 %, 
report the analysis as <0.0005 % or the actual determined 
value. 
7.3 Sheet steel grades defined by this specification are 
suitable for welding if appropriate welding conditions are 
selected. For certain welding processes, if more restrictive 
composition limits are desirable, they shall be specified at the 
time of inquiry and confirmed at the time of ordering. 
8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 CS and DS: 
8.1.1 Typical, nonmandatory mechanical properties for CS 
and DS for all grades specified in Table 1 and Specification 
A568/A568M Table X2.3 are found in Table 3. 
8.1.2 The material represented by all grades specified in 
Table 1 and Specification A568/ A568M Table X2.3 shall be 
capable of being bent at room temperature in any direction 
through 180° flat on itself without cracking on the outside of 
the bent portion (see the section on bend test in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370). The bend test is not a requirement of 
delivery. However, if testing is performed by the purchaser, 
material not conforming to the requirement shall be subject to 
rejection. 
8.2 SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS: 
8.2.1 The available grades and corresponding mechanical 
properties for SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS are shown in 
Table 4.
