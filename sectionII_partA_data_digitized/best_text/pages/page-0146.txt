TABLE A2.8 Permissible Camber for Carbon Steel, High-Strength 
Low-Alloy Steel, and Alloy Steel Universal Mill Plates and High­
Strength Low-Alloy Steel and Alloy Steel Sheared or Gas-Cut 
Rectangular Plates 
Norn I-Camber, as it relates to plates, is the horizontal edge curvature 
in the length, measured over the entire length of the plate in the flat 
position.

TABLE A2.9 Permissible Variations from Flatness for Carbon Steel Plates 
Norn !-Flatness Variations for Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and variation in flatness along the length shall not 
exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 4000 mm in length, or in any 4000 mm of longer plates. 
Norn 2-Flatness Variations for Width-The flatness variation across the width shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width. 
Norn 3-When the longer dimension is under 900 mm, the variation in flatness along the length and across the width shall not exceed 6 mm in each 
direction. When the longer dimension is from 900 to 1800 mm, inclusive, the flatness variation shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount for the 
specified width, but in no case less than 6 mm. 
Norn 4--The tolerances given in this table apply to plates that have a minimum specified tensile strength not over 415 MPa or comparable chemistry 
or hardness. For plates specified to a higher minimum tensile strength or comparable chemistry or hardness, the limits given in the table are increased 
to 1 V2 times the amounts in the above table. 
Norn 5-This table and notes cover the flatness tolerances of circular and sketch plates, based on the maximum dimensions of those plates. 
Norn 6-Plates shall be in a horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured.
