SA-989 /SA-989M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the 
contract or order. 
Sl. Macroetch Test 
S 1.1 A sample part shall be sectioned and etched to show 
internal imperfections. The test shall be conducted according to 
Test Method E340. Details of the test shall be agreed upon 
between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
S2. Chemical Composition 
S2.1 The chemical composition of a sample from one part 
from each lot of parts shall be determined by the manufacturer. 
The composition of the sample shall conform to the chemical 
composition requirements prescribed in Table 1. 
S2.2 A product analysis in accordance with Section 10 shall 
be made from one randomly selected part representing each 
size and type (See 9.5.1.1) of part on the order. If the analysis 
fails to comply, each part in that lot, at the option of the 
manufacturer, shall be checked and accepted if the analysis for 
the part complies with the requirements, or the lot shall be 
rejected. All results shall be reported to the purchaser. 
S3. Tension Tests 
S3.1 In addition to the requirements of Section 9, one 
tension specimen shall be obtained from a representative part 
from each production lot at a location agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. The results of the test shall 
comply with Table 3 and shall be reported to the purchaser. 
S4. Particle Size 
S4.1 In addition to the manufacturing process of 5.1, the 
maximum particle size is 0.020 in. [0.5 mm], and the powders 
shall be produced by the gas atomization process. 
S5. Powder Shielding 
S5.1 Immediately following atomization, the powder shall 
remain shielded by an inert gas, until the powder is below a 
temperature of 105 °F [ 40 °C] to ensure that the detrimental 
absorption of oxygen and other deleterious contaminants is no 
longer possible. The powder shall be stored under a positive 
nitrogen or argon atmosphere or vacuum to minimize potential 
oxidation or contamination. 
S6. Magnetic Particle Examination 
S6.1 All accessible surfaces of a finished alloy steel part 
shall be examined by a magnetic-particle method. The method 
shall be in accordance with Test Method A275/A275M. Ac­
ceptance limits shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer 
and purchaser. 
S7. Liquid Penetrant Examination 
S7 .1 All accessible surfaces shall be examined by a liquid 
penetrant method in accordance with Test Method E165/ 
E165M. Acceptance limits shall be agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
SS. Hydrostatic Testing 
S8.l A hydrostatic test at a pressure agreed upon between 
the manufacturer and the purchaser shall be applied by the 
manufacturer. 
S9. Repair Welding 
S9.1 No repair welding shall be permitted without prior 
approval of the purchaser. If permitted, the restrictions of 
Section 15 shall apply. 
SlO. Heat Treatment Details 
S 10.1 The manufacturer shall furnish a detailed test report 
containing the information required in 16.1 and shall include 
all pertinent details of the heat treating cycle given the parts. 
Sll. Hardness Test 
S 11.1 Each part shall be hardness tested and shall meet the 
requirements of Table 3. 
S12. Alternate Heat Treatment (Grade K90901) 
Sl2.l Grade K90901 shall be normalized in accordance 
with Section 7 and tempered at a temperature, to be specified 
by the purchaser, less than 1350 °F [730 °C]. It shall be the 
purchaser's responsibility to subsequently temper at 1350 °F 
[730 °C] min to conform to the requirements of the specifica­
tion. All mechanical tests shall be made on material heat 
treated in accordance with Section 7. The certification shall 
reference this supplementary requirement indicating the tem­
pering temperature applied. The notation "S 1 0" shall be 
included with the required marking of the part. 
Sl3. Fatigue Acceptance Test 
Sl3.1 For alloy steel, except UNS K90901, components 
intended for service above 800 °F [425°C], and for UNS 
K90901 components intended for service above 1000 °F 
[540 °C] a uniaxial fatigue test shall be performed. 
S13.2 The fatigue test shall be performed in air at 1100 °F 
[595 °C] at an axial strain range of 1.0 % with a one hour hold 
period at the maximum positive strain point in each cycle. Test 
specimen location and orientation shall be in accordance with 
the general guidance of Specification A961/A961M and the 
applicable product specifications. Testing shall be conducted in 
accordance with Practice E606/E606M. The test shall exceed 
200 cycles without fracture or a 20 % drop in the load range. 
S13.3 Failure to meet this requirement shall be cause for 
rejection of all parts from that powder blend. 
S13.4 Test frequency shall be the same as for tension tests 
(see 9.5). Retesting is permitted. Two additional specimens 
produced from the same powder blend shall be tested and both 
specimens must pass the cyclic life requirement. Further retests 
are not permitted.
