3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 remelted heat-in secondary melting, all of the ingots 
remelted from a single primary heat. 
3.1.2 thin-wall tube-a tube meeting the specified outside 
diameter and specified wall thickness set forth as follows: 
Specified Outside Specified Wall Thickness 
Diameter 
2 in. [50.8 mm] or less 2 % or less of specified outside diameter 
Greater than 2 in. [50.8 mm] 3 % or less of specified outside diameter 
Any 0.020 in. [0.5 mm] or less 
3.2 Other defined terms-The definitions in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370, Test Methods, Practices, and Terminol­
ogy A751, and Terminology A941 are applicable to this 
specification and to those listed in 1. 1. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order all ordering information necessary to purchase 
the needed material. Examples of such infonnation include, but 
are not limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
4.1.2 Specificiation number with grade or class, or both, as 
applicable and year date, 
4.1.3 Manufacture (hot-finished or cold-finished), 
4.1.4 Size (outside diameter and minimum wall thickness), 
4.1.5 Length (specific or random), 
4.1.6 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test 
Methods A1058 when material is ordered to an M suffix (SI 
units) product standard. If the choice of test track is not 
specified in the order, then the default ASTM test track shall be 
used as noted in Test Methods A1058. 
4.1.7 Supplementary Requirements, and 
4.1.8 Additional requirements. 
5. Process 
5.1 The steel may be made by any process. 
5.2 If a specific type of melting is required by the purchaser, 
it shall be as stated on the purchase order. 
739 
5.3 The primary melting may incorporate separate degas­
sing or refining and may be followed by secondary melting, 
such as electroslag remelting or vacuum-arc remelting. 
5.4 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When 
steel of different grades is sequentially strand cast, identifica­
tion of the resultant transition material is required. The 
producer shall remove the transition material by an established 
procedure that positively separates the grades. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 Samples for chemical analysis, and method of analysis 
shall be in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, and 
Terminology A751. 
6.2 Heat Analysis-If the heat analysis reported by the steel 
producer is not sufficiently complete for conformance with the 
heat analysis requirements of the applicable product specifica­
tion to be fully assessed, the manufacturer may complete the 
assessment of conformance with such heat analysis require­
ments by using a product analysis for the specified elements 
that were not reported by the steel producer, provided that 
product analysis tolerances are not applied and the heat 
analysis is not altered.
