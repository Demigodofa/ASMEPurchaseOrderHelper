provided that the axial length of the part is approximately 
parallel to the metal flow lines of the stock. Except for all 
types of flanges, elbows, return bends, tees, and header 
tees, other parts up to and including NPS 4 may be 
machined from hot-rolled or forged bar. 
4.5 When specified in the order, the manufacturer shall 
submit for purchaser's approval a sketch showing the shape 
of the rough forging before machining. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements of 
Table 1. 
5.2 If required by the purchaser, product analysis may 
be performed in accordance with the requirements of 
A 961. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 The forgings shall be heat treated by the manufac­
turer by either of the following methods as mutually agreed 
upon between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
6.1.1 Quenched and Tempered - Heat to a uniform 
temperature of 1475 ± 25°F [800 ± 15°C]; hold at this 
temperature for a minimum time of 1 h/in. [2.5 min/mm] 
of thickness but in no case less than 30 min; quench by 
immersion in circulating water. Reheat until the forging 
attains a uniform temperature within the range from 1050 
to l 125°F [565 to 605°C]; hold at this temperature for a 
minimum time of 1 h/in. [2.5 min/mm] of thickness but 
minimum rate of 300°F [165°C]/h to a temperature not 
exceeding 600°F [3 l 5°C]. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Tension Test - Forgings to Types 1 and 2 shall 
conform to the tensile requirements of Table 2. 
7 .2 Impact Test - The Charpy impact test requirements 
in Table 3 shall be met unless Supplementary Requirement 
S2 of this specification has been specified. 
7.2.1 The values for energy absorption and the frac­
ture appearance in percentage of shear fracture for each 
specimen shall be recorded and reported for information. 
8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
8.1 The forgings shall have a workman-like finish and 
shall be free of injurious defects. 
9. Number of Tests and Retests 
9.1 At least one tension test and one set of Charpy 
V-notch impact tests shall be made from each heat in each 
heat-treatment charge. 
9.2 If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform 
to the specified requirements, the manufacturer may retreat 
the forgings, but not more than three additional times. 
Retreatment involves re-austenitizing the forgings. Retests 
shall be made in accordance with this section. 
in no case less than 30 min; cool in air or water quench, 9.3 If the lateral expansion result from one Charpy

6.2 When stress relieving is to be performed after fabri­
cation, the recommended stress-relieving treatment is as 
follows: gradually and uniformly heat the steel to a temper­
ature between 1025 and 1085°F [550 and 585°C]; hold for 
a minimum of 2 h for thicknesses up to I in. [25 mm]. 
For thicknesses over I in. [25 mm], a minimum additional 
holding time in the ratio of 1 h/in. [2.5 min/mm] of thick­
ness in excess of I in. [25 mm] shall be added. Cool at a

10. Test Specimens 
10.1 The test specimens shall be located at any point 
midway between the center and surface of solid forgings, 
and at any point mid-thickness of the heaviest section of 
hollow or bored forgings. For solid forgings where test 
metal is provided on the periphery, test specimens shall 
be taken at mid-thickness of the test prolongation. 
10.2 Tests shall be oriented so that the longitudinal 
axis of the specimen is parallel to the major direction of 
grain flow. 
10.3 When fabrication requires stress relieving, the 
purchaser shall specify stress relieving of the test pieces 
prior to machining of the test specimens. Stress relieving 
shall be carried out as prescribed in 6.2.
