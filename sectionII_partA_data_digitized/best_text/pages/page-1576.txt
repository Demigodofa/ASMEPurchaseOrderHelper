TABLE X1 .1 Suggested Minimum Inside Radius for Cold Bending 
NOTE 1-(t) Equals a radius equivalent to the steel thickness. 
NoTE 2-The suggested radius should be used as a minimum for 90° 
bends in actual shop practice. 
NoTE 3-Material which does not perform satisfactorily, when fabri­
cated in accordance with the above requirements, may be subject to 
rejection pending negotiation with the steel supplier.
