Step # I -Determine furnace factor (FF) for each heat based 
on weight. 
Furnace A= 25/125 = 20 % 
Furnace B = 50/125 = 40 % 
Furnace C = 50/125 = 40 % 
(Individual Fnce Ht. Wt) 
FF = ( Combined Heat Weight) X lOO % 
Step # 2-Calculate the weighted average for each element. 
Examples for several elements shown below: 
Weighted avg= sum of ( % element in each furnace heat X FF) 
• Weighted avg of Carbon (weighted avg): 
Furnace A-0.20 % x 20 % = 0.04 % 
Furnace B-0.25 % x 40 % = 0.10 % 
Furnace C-0.25 % x 40 % = 0.1 0 % 
Add to get weighted avg of 0.24 %

• Weighted avg of manganese: 
Furnace A-0.50 % x 20 % = 0.10 % 
Furnace B-0.50 % x 40 % = 0.20 % 
Furnace C-0.50 % x 40 % = 0.20 % 
Add to get weighted avg of 0.50 % 
• Weighted avg of phosphorus: 
Furnace A-0.010 % x 20 % = 0.002 % 
Furnace B-0.013 % x 40 % = 0.0052 % 
Furnace C-0.015 % x 40 % = 0.006 % 
Add to get weighted avg of 0.013 %A

A3. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW MATERIALS 
A3.1 New materials may be proposed for inclusion in 
specifications referencing this specification of general require­
ments subject to the following conditions: 
A3.l.1 Application for the addition of a new grade to a 
specification shall be made to the chair of the subcommittee 
that has jurisdiction over that specification. 
A3 .1.2 The application shall be accompanied by a statement 
from at least one user indicating that there is a need for the new 
grade to be included in the applicable specification. 
A3.l.3 The application shall be accompanied by test data as 
required by the applicable specification. Test data from a 
minimum of three test lots, as defined by the specification, each 
from a different heat, shall be furnished. 
A3.l.4 The application shall provide recommendations for 
all requirements appearing in the applicable specification. 
A3.l.5 The application shall state whether or not the new 
grade is covered by patent. 
A4. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF MATERIALS FROM OTHER A0l OR B02.07 SPECIFICATIONS 
A4.l Wrought materials that are already covered by another 
AOl or B02.07 specification may be proposed for inclusion in 
specifications referencing this specification of general require­
ments subject to the following conditions: 
A4.1.1 Application for the addition of a grade that is already 
covered in another AOl or B02.07 specification shall be made 
to the chair of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the 
specification to which the addition is being proposed. 
A4.1.2 The chemical requirements, the specified mechani­
cal properties, and the heat treatment requirements of the grade 
being added shall be the same as those for the grade in the AOl 
or B02.07 specification in which the grade is presently covered. 
A4.1.3 The application shall provide recommendations for 
all requirements appearing in the applicable specification. 
A4. l.4 The application shall state whether or not the grade 
is covered by patent. •
