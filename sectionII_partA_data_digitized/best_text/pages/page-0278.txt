A5.9/A5.9M, A5.11/A5.11M, A5.14/A5.14M, A5.23/A5.23M, or A5.28/A5.28M. 
8 Purchaser approval required. 
c All repairs in F 91 Types 1 and 2 shall be made with one of the following welding processes and consumables: SMAW, A5.5/A5.5M E90XX-B9; SAW, A5.23/A5.23M EB9 
+ flux; GTAW, A5.28/A5.28M ER90S-B9; and FCAW, A5.29/A5.29M E91T1-B9. In addition, the sum of the Ni+Mn content of all welding consumables shall not exceed 
1.0%. 
0 All repairs in F 92, F 93, F 115, F 911, and F 122, shall be made using welding consumables meeting the chemical requirements for the grade in Table 2. 
E Preheat and PWHT are not required for this grade for forgings whose section thickness does not exceed 0.500 in. [12. 7 mm]. 
P NR = not required. 
0 WQ = water quench. 
H Filler metal shall additionally have 0.04 % minimum carbon. 
1 Matching filler metal is available. 
J Match filler metal is available. Fabricators have also used AWS A5.14/A5.14M, Classification ERNiCrMo-3 and AWS A5.11/A5.11 M, Class E, ENiCrMo-3 filler metals. 
18.2.4 Chemical analysis results, Section 8 (Table 2), re­
ported results shall be to the same number of significant figures 
as the limits specified in Table 2 for that element, 
18.2.5 Hardness results, Section 9 (Table 3, and for F 23, 
Tables 2 and 3), 
18.2.6 Grain size results, Section 10, and 
18.2.7 Any supplementary testing required by the purchase 
order. 
19. Product Marking 
19.1 In addition to the marking requirements of Specifica­
tion A961/A961M, the following additional marking require­
ments shall apply: 
19.1.1 Quenched and tempered low alloy or martensitic 
stainless forgings shall be stamped with the letters QT follow­
ing the specification designation. 
19.1.2 Forgings repaired by welding shall be marked with 
the letter "W" following the Specification designation. When 
repair 0 welded austenitic stainless steel forgings have not been 
postweld heat treated in accordance with Table 4, the letters 
"WNS" shall be marked following the specification designa­
tion. 
19.1.3 Parts meeting all requirements for more than one 
class or grade may be marked with more than one class or 
grade designation such as F 304/F 304H, F 304/F 304L, and the 
like. 
19.1.4 Plugs and bushings furnished to ASME B16.11 
requirements are not required to be marked. 
19.1.5 When agreed upon between the purchaser and 
manufacturer, and specified in the order, the markings shall be 
painted or stenciled on the fitting or stamped on a metal or 
plastic tag which shall be securely attached to the fitting. 
226 
19.1.6 Grade F 91 shall be additionally marked with the 
appropriate Type. 
19.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 19.1, 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. The bar coding system, if applied at
