3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and 
shall conform to the fine austenitic grain requirement of 
5. Heat Treatment 
5 .1 All plates shall be heat treated by heating to a suitable 
temperature within the range from 1550 to 1800°F [845 to 
980°C], holding for a sufficient time to obtain uniform tem­
perature throughout the plate thickness and then quenching, in 
water. Subsequently the plates shall be tempered at a suitable 
temperature to produce the specified properties, but not less 
than 1100°F [595°C] with a minimum holding time of½ h/in. 
[1.2 min/mm] of thickness, but not less than V2 h. 
5.2 When the plates are heat treated by the fabricator, it 
shall be his responsibility to apply the proper heat treatment 
and to conduct tests he deems necessary to assure that the 
specified properties are attained. Plates thicker than 2 in. [50 
mm] shall be stress-relieved by the manufacturer prior to 
shipment at a temperature no lower than 1100°F [595°C]. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements 
shown in Table 1 unless otherwise modified in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement S 17, Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized 
Steel, in Specification A20/ A20M. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7.1 Tension Test Requirements: 
7 .1.1 The material as represented by the tension-test speci­
mens shall conform to the requirements shown in Table 2. 
7.1.2 For nominal plate thicknesses of¾ in. [20 mm] and 
under, the 1 V2-in. [40 mm] wide rectangular specimen may be 
used, and the elongation may be determined in a 2-in. [50-mm] 
gage length that include the fracture and that shows the greatest 
elongation.

Supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the order. 
A list of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser are included 
in Specification A20/ A20M. Several of those considered suitable for use with this specification are 
listed below by title. Other tests may be performed by agreement between the supplier and the 
purchaser.
