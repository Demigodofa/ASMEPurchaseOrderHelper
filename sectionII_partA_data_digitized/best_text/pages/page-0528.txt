dip, mechanically deposited, Zinc/Aluminum Corrosion Pro­
tective Coating, or no preference. 
4.3.2 When hot-dip is specified, the fasteners shall be 
zinc-coated by the hot-dip process and the coating shall 
conform to the coating weight/thickness and performance 
requirements of Specification F2329. 
4.3.3 When mechanically deposited is specified, the fasten­
ers shall be zinc-coated by the mechanical deposition process 
and the coating shall conform to the coating weight/thickness 
and performance requirements of Class 55 of Specification 
B695. 
4.3.4 When Zinc/Aluminum Corrosion Protective Coating 
is specified, the coating shall conform to the coating weight/ 
thickness and performance requirements of Grade 3 of Speci­
fication Fl136. 
4.3.5 When no preference is specified, the supplier shall 
furnish either a hot-dip zinc coating in accordance with 
Specification F2329, a mechanically deposited zinc coating in 
accordance with Specification B695, Class 55, or a Zinc/ 
Aluminum Corrosion Protective Coating in accordance with 
Specification F1136, Grade 3. Threaded components (bolts and 
nuts) shall be coated by the same zinc-coating process and the 
supplier's option is limited to one process per item with no 
mixed processes in a lot. 
4.4 Lubrication-When zinc-coated nuts are ordered with 
the bolts, the nuts shall be lubricated in accordance with 
Specification A563, Supplementary Requirement Sl, to mini­
mize galling. 
4.5 Secondary Processing: 
4.5.1 If any processing, which can affect the mechanical 
properties or performance of the bolts, is performed after the 
initial testing, the bolts shall be retested for all specified 
mechanical properties and performance requirements affected 
by the reprocessing. 
4.5.2 When the secondary process is heat treatment, the 
bolts shall be tested for all specified mechanical prope1ties. Hot 
dip zinc-coated bolts shall be tested for all specified mechani­
cal prope1ties and rotational capacity. If zinc-coated nuts are 
relubricated after the initial rotational capacity tests, the 
assemblies shall be retested for rotational capacity. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Type 1 bolts shall be plain carbon steel, carbon boron 
steel, alloy steel or alloy boron steel at the manufacturer's 
option, conforming to the chemical composition specified in 
Table 1. 
5.2 Type 3 bolts shall be weathering steel and shall conform 
to one of the chemical compositions specified in Table 2. The 
selection of the chemical composition, A, B, C, D, E, or F, shall 
be at the option of the bolt manufacturer. See Guide G 101 for 
methods of estimating the atmospheric corrosion resistance of 
low alloy steels. 
5.3 Product analyses made on finished bolts representing 
each lot shall conform to the product analysis requirements 
specified in Tables 1 and 2, as applicable.

A Steel, as defined by the American Iron and Steel Institute, shall be considered 
to be alloy when the maximum of the range given for the content of alloying 
elements exceeds one or more of the following limits: Manganese, 1.65 %; silicon, 
0.60 %; copper, 0.60 % or in which a definite range or a definite minimum quantity 
of any of the following elements is specified or required within the limits of the 
recognized field of constructional alloy steels: aluminum, chromium up to 3.99 %, 
cobalt, columbium, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, tungsten, vanadium, zirconium, 
or any other alloying elements added to obtain a desired alloying effect. 
5 .4 Heats of steel to which bismuth, selenium, tellurium, or 
lead has been intentionally added shall not be permitted for 
bolts. 
5.5 Compliance with 5.4 shall be based on certification that 
heats of steel having any of the listed elements intentionally 
added were not used to produce the bolts. 
5.6 Chemical analyses shall be performed in accordance 
with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751.
