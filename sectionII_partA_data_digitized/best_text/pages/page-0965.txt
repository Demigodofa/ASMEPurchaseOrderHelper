Xl. MEASURING MICROINCH FINISH 
Xl.1 The procedure for making microinch readings on 
interior surfaces of cold worked tubing (not polished or 
ground) ½-in. [12.7-mm] inside diameter and larger is as 
follows: 
Xl.1.1 Measurements on tubing with longitudinal or no 
predominant lay should be circumferential on the inside 
surface of the straight tube, prior to any fabrication, on a plane 
approximately perpendicular to the tube axis. Measurements 
on tubing with circumferential lay should be longitudinal. 
Xl.1.2 Measurements should be made not less than 1 in. 
[25.4 mm] from the end. 
Xl.1.3 Measurements should be made at four positions 
approximately 90° apart or over a complete circumference if 
the trace should otherwise overlap. 
X 1.1.4 The length of trace should be in accordance with the 
latest revision of Section 4.5 of ASME B46.1 (not less than 
0.600 in. [15.24 mm] long). 
Xl.1.5 A minimum of three such measurements should be 
made spaced not less than ¼ in. [6.4 mm] apart along the 
longitudinal axis. 
Xl.1.6 The numerical rating shall be the arithmetical aver­
age microinch of all readings taken. Each reading to be 
averaged should be the mean position of the indicator during 
the trace; any momentary meter excursions occupying less than 
10 % of the total trace should be ignored. 
Xl.1.7 A deviation in numerical rating in various parts of a 
tube may be expected. Experience to date indicates that a 
variation of about ±35 % is normal. 
Xl.2 Instruments should meet the specifications given in the 
latest revision of ASME B46.1. 
Xl.3 Mecharucal tracing is preferred. If hand tracing is 
used, the speed of trace should not vary by more than ±20 % 
from the required to give the appropriate cutoff. The 0.030-in. 
[0.76 mm] roughness width cutoff should be used. 
Xl.4 Microinch [0.0000254 mm] determinations only refer 
to roughness of areas that do not contain a defect, injurious or 
otherwise. Such defects as seams, slivers, pits, laps, etc., are 
subject to ordinary visual inspection in accordance with 
applicable specifications or trade customs, and have no rela­
tionship to roughness. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
Committee A0l has identified the location of selected changes to this standard since the last issue, 
A513/A513M- 20, that may impact the use of this standard. (Approved July 1, 2020.) 
( 1) Changed 1.3.1 to allow indeterminate wall thicknesses.
