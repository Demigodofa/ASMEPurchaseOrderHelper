3. Ordering Information 
3.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order information necessary to purchase the needed 
material. In addition to the ordering information guidelines in 
Specification A961/A961M, orders should include the follow­
ing information: 
3.1.1 The number of test reports required (see Section 14). 
3.1.2 Additional requirements (see Table 1 footnotes). 
3.1.3 Options in the specification. See 5.4.2.1. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A961/A961M, including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase 
order. Failure to comply with the general requirements of 
Specification A961/A961M constitutes nonconformance with 
this specification. In case of conflict between the requirements 
of this specification and Specification A961/A961M, this 
specification shall prevail. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 Melting Process-The steel shall be produced by any of 
the following primary processes: open-hearth, basic oxygen, 
electric-furnace, or vacuum-induction melting (VIM). The 
primary melting may incorporate separate degassing or 
refining, and may be followed by secondary melting using 
electroslag remelting (ESR), or vacuum-arc remelting (VAR). 
5.1.1 The steel shall be fully killed, fine-grain practice. 
5.1.2 The molten steel may be vacuum treated prior to or 
during pouring of the ingot. 
5.2 Discard-A sufficient discard shall be made to secure 
freedom from injurious piping and undue segregation. 
5.3 Forging Process: 
5.3.1 Material for forgings shall consist of ingots, or forged, 
rolled, or strandcast blooms, billets, slabs, or bars. 
5.3.2 The finished product shall be a forging as defined in 
the Terminology section of Specification A788/A788M. 
5.3.3 Hollow parts may be machined from rolled bar or 
seamless tubular materials provided the longitudinal axis of the 
part is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bar. Other parts, 
up to and including NPS4, may be machined from hot-rolled or 
forged bar provided the longitudinal axis of the part is parallel 
to the longitudinal axis of the bar. Flanges, elbows, return 
bends, tees, and header tees shall not be machined directly 
from bar stock. 
5.4 Heat Treatment: 
5.4.1 After hot working and before reheating for heat 
treatment, the forging shall be allowed to cool substantially 
below the transformation range. 
5.4.2 Forgings of grades other than Grade LF787 shall be 
furnished in the normalized, or normalized and tempered, or 
quenched and tempered condition. At the option of the 
manufacturer, forgings furnished in the quenched and tempered 
condition may be normalized prior to the austenitize/quench 
operation. 
5.4.2.1 Quenching shall consist of either: 
( 1) fully austenitizing the forgings followed by quenching 
in a suitable liquid medium, or . 
(2) using a multiple stage procedure whereby the forging is 
first fully austenitized and rapidly cooled, then reheated to 
partially re-asutenitize, followed by quenching in a suitable 
liquid medium. 
( 3) Unless otherwise specified by the purchaser, the choice 
of (J) or (2) shall be at the option of the manufacturer. 
5.4.2.2 All quenched forgings shall be tempered to 5.4.2.3 
5.4.2.3 Forgings, when tempered, shall be tempered at 
1100 °F [590 °C], minimum, holding at temperature a mini­
mum of 30 min/in. [30 min/25 mm] of maximum thickness, but 
in no case less than 30 min. 
5.4.3 Grade LF787 forgings shall be furnished in either the 
normalized-and-precipitation heat treated condition or in the 
quenched-and-precipitation heat treated condition. The heat 
treatment procedures shall be as follows: 
5.4.3.1 Normalized-and-Precipitation Heat Treated­
Austenitize in the range from 1600 to 1725 °F [870 to 940 °C]
