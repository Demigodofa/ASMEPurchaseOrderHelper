15.1.1 A range of hardness can properly be specified only 
for quenched and tempered or normalized and tempered 
material. For annealed material a maximum figure only should 
be specified. For normalized material a minimum or a maxi­
mum hardness may be specified by agreement. In general, no 
hardness requirements should be applied to untreated material. 
15.1.2 Brinell hardness may be required when tensile prop­
erties are not specified. 
15.2 Test Specimen-Brinell hardness tests are made on 
prepared areas and sufficient metal must be removed from the 
surface to eliminate decarburized metal and other surface 
irregularities. The thickness of the piece tested must be such 
that no bulge or other marking showing the effect of the load 
appears on the side of the piece opposite the indentation. 
15.3 Procedure: 
15.3.1 It is essential that the applicable product specifica­
tions state clearly the position at which Brinell hardness 
indentations are to be made and the number of such indenta­
tions required. The distance of the center of the indentation 
from the edge of the specimen or edge of another indentation 
must be at least two and one-half times the diameter of the 
indentation. 
15.3.2 Measure two diameters of the indentation at right 
angles to the nearest 0.1 mm, estimate to the nearest 0.05 mm, 
and average to the nearest 0.05 mm. If the two diameters differ 
by more than 0.1 mm, discard the readings and make a new 
indentation. 
16. Rockwell Test 
16.1 The Rockwell Test shall be carried out in accordance 
with the requirements of Test Methods El 8, ISO 6508-1, or TIS 
Z 2245.

17. Portable Hardness Test 
17 .1 Although this standard generally prefers the use of 
fixed-location Brinell or Rockwell hardness test methods, it is 
not always possible to perform the hardness test using such 
equipment due to the part size, location, or other logistical 
reasons. In this event, hardness testing using portable equip­
ment as described in Test Methods A956/A956M, A1038, and 
Ell0 shall be used with strict compliance for reporting the test 
results in accordance with the selected standard (see examples 
below). Standard Practice A833 may be used, although it might 
not always be suitable as a criterion for acceptance or rejection 
since Practice A833 does not contain a precision and bias 
statement. 
17.1.1 Practice A833-The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
given the HBC designation followed by the comparative test 
bar hardness to indicate that it was determined by a portable 
comparative hardness tester, as in the following example: 
17 .1.1.1 232 HBC/2.40 where 232 is the hardness test result 
using the portable comparative test method (HBC) and 240 is 
the Brinell hardness of the comparative test bar. 
17.1.2 Practice A956/A956M: 
17 .1.2.1 The measured hardness number shall be reported in 
accordance with the standard methods and appended with a 
Leeb impact device in parenthesis to indicate that it was 
determined by a portable hardness tester, as in the following 
example: 
( 1) 350 HW where 350 is the hardness test result using the 
portable Leeb hardness test method with the HLD impact 
device.
