SA-1017 /SA-1017M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Chromium­
Molybdenum-Tungsten 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers Chromium-Molybdenum­
Tungsten alloy steel plates intended primarily for welded 
boilers and pressure vessels designed for elevated temperature 
service. 
1.2 Plates are available under this specification in grades 
having different alloy contents as follows: 
Nominal Nominal Nominal 
Chromium Molybdenum Tungsten 
Grade Content,% Content,% Content,% 
23 2.25 0.20 1.60 
911 9.00 1.00 1.00 
92 9.00 0.45 1.75 
122 12.00 0.40 2.00 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.4 The specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements 
3 .1 Material supplied to this material specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted variations in dimensions and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 Except as allowed by 5.2 and 5.3, all plates shall be 
normalized at 1900 to 1975°F [1040 to 1080°C]. Plates for 
Grades 23, 92, and 122 shall be tempered at 1350 to 1470°F 
[730 to 800°C]. Grade 911 plates shall be tempered at 1365 to 
1435°F [740 to 780°C].
