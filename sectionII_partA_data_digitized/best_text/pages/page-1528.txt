parts or samples as defined in 9 .2 distributed throughout the 
charge. At least eight samples shall be checked from each batch 
load and a least one check/h shall be made from a continuous 
run. When the furnace batch charge is less than eight parts, 
each part shall be checked. If any hardness test result falls 
outside the prescribed limits, the entire lot of parts shall be 
reheat treated and the requirements of 9.5.1 shall apply. 
9.7 Fatigue Tests-When specified in the order, the fatigue 
strength of alloy steel, except UNS K90901, components 
intended for service above 800 °F [425 °C] and for UNS 
K90901 components intended for service above 1000 °F 
[540 °C] shall be tested in accordance with the requirements of 
Supplementary Requirement S13. 
10. Product Analysis 
10.1 The purchaser is permitted to make a product analysis 
on parts supplied to this specification. The chemical composi-
tion of a sample from one part from each lot of parts shall be 
determined by the manufacturer. Samples for analysis shall be 
taken from midway between the center and surface of solid 
parts, midway between the inner and outer surfaces of hollow 
parts, midway between the center and surface of full-size 
prolongations, or from broken mechanical test specimens. The 
chemical composition thus determined shall conform to Table 
1 with the tolerances as stated in Table 4 or Table 5.
