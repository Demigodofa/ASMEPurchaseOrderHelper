include the following as required to adequately describe the 
desired material: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material (electric resistance-welded carbon 
or alloy steel mechanical tubing),

dimension and wall thickness and comer radii, if required (See 
9.1 and 9.2), 
3.1.11 Length, round, mill lengths or definite cut length (See 
8.3), square and rectangular, specified length (See 9.4), 
3.1.12 Squareness of cut, round tubing, if required, (See 
8.4), 
3.1.13 Burrs removed, if required (See 11.2), 
3.1.14 Protective coating (See 14.1),

4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel may be made by any process. 
4.2 If a specific type of melting is required by the purchaser, 
it shall be as stated on the purchase order. 
4.3 The primary melting may incorporate separate degas­
sing or refining, and may be followed by secondary melting, 
such as electroslag or vacuum-arc remelting. If secondary

melting is employed, the heat shall be defined as all of the 
ingots remelted from a single primary heat. 
4.4 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When 
steel of different grades is sequentially strand cast, identifica­
tion of the resultant transition material is required. The 
producer shall remove the transition material by an established 
procedure that positively separates the grades. 
4.5 Tubes shall be made by the electric-resistance-welded 
process and shall be made from hot- or cold-rolled steel as 
specified. 
4.5.1 The weld shall not be located within the radius of the 
comers of any shaped tube unless specified by the purchaser. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5 .1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1 or Table 2 (See 
Specification A1040). If no grade is specified, Grades MT 1010 
to MT 1020 may be furnished. Analyses of steels other than 
those listed are available. To determine their availability, the 
purchaser should contact the producer. 
5.2 When a carbon steel grade is ordered under this 
specification, supplying an alloy grade that specifically re­
quires the addition of any element other than those listed for 
the ordered grade in Tables 1 and 2 is not permitted. 
5.3 Mechanical tubing with improved ductility may be 
produced from Drawing Steel (Types A and B), Deep Drawing 
Steel, or Extra Deep Drawing Steels identified in Specifications 
A1008/A1008M, A1011/A1011M, or Al039/A1039M. Those 
Specifications offer guidance in the form of nonmandatory 
Typical Ranges of Mechanical Properties. 
6. Heat Analysis 
6.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the 
steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of the ele­
ments specified; if secondary melting processes are employed, 
the heat analysis shall be obtained from one remelted ingot or 
the product of one remelted ingot of each primary melt. The 
heat analysis shall conform to the requirements specified,

A Rimmed or capped steels which may be used for the above grades are 
characterized by a lack of uniformity in their chemical composition, and for this 
reason product analysis is not technologically appropriate unless misapplication is 
clearly indicated.
