SA-814/SA-814M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
7.2 Alignment (Camber)-Using a 3-ft [1.0-m] straightedge 
placed so that both ends are in contact with the pipe, the 
camber shall not be more than 0.030-in. [0.8-mm]. 
7.3 Thickness-The wall thickness at any point in the pipe 
shall be within the thickness tolerance specified in Table 1, 
except that for pipe in which the wall thickness exceeds 
0.188-in. [4.8-mm] a weld reinforcement of up to 0.015-in. 
[0.38-mm] is permitted on the inside of the pipe. 
8. Lengths 
8.1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following 
regular practice. 
8.1.1 Unless otherwise agreed upon, all sizes up to and 
including NPS 4 are available in a length up to 24 ft (Note 2) 
with the permissible range of 15 to 24 ft (Note 2). 
Norn 2-The value(s) applies when the inch-pound designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase. When the "M" designation of this 
specification is the basis of purchase, the corresponding metric value(s) 
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
8.1.2 If definite cut lengths are desired, the lengths required 
shall be specified in the order. No pipe shall be under the 
specified length and not more than ¼ in. [6 mm] over that 
specified. 
8.1.3 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise specified. 
9. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
9.1 The finished pipes shall be free of injurious imperfec­
tions and shall have a workmanlike finish. Minor imperfections 
may be removed by grinding, provided the wall thicknesses are 
not decreased to less than that permitted in Section 7. 
10. General Requirements 
10.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A999/ A999M unless otherwise provided herein. 
11. Examination of Double-Welded Pipe 
11.1 Both ends of each double-welded (Class DW) pipe 
shall be visually examined to determine that complete fusion 
was attained between the two welds. In lieu of examining the 
ends of the pipe, this examination may be performed on 
cropped ends removed from both ends of each double welded 
pipe. 
12. Mechanical Tests Required 
12.1 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One tension 
test shall be made on a specimen for lots of not more than 100 
pipes. Tension tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes 
for lots of more than 100 pipes. 
NOTE 3-The term "lot," for mechanical tests, applies to all pipe of the 
same nominal size and wall thickness (or schedule) which is produced 
from the same heat of steel and subjected to the same finishing treatment 
(J) in a continuous heat-treatment furnace, or (2) in a batch-type 
heat-treatment furnace, equipped with recording pyrometers and automati­
cally controlled within a 50 °F [30 °C] range, the larger of (a) Each 200 
ft [60 m] or fraction thereof or, (b) That pipe heat treated in the same batch 
furnace charge. 
12.2 Flattening Test-For material heat treated in a batch­
type furnace, flattening tests shall be made of 5 % of the pipe 
from each heat-treated lot. For material heat treated by the 
continuous process, this test shall be made on a sufficient 
number of pipe to constitute 5 % of the lot, but in no case less 
than two lengths of pipe. 
12.2.1 For pipe where the diameter equals or exceeds NPS 
10, a transverse-guided face bend test of the weld may be 
conducted instead of a flattening test in accordance with the 
method outlined in the steel tubular product supplement of Test 
Methods and Definitions A370. The ductility of the weld shall 
be considered acceptable when there is no evidence of cracks 
in the weld or between the weld and the base metal after 
bending. Test specimens from 5 % of the lot shall be taken 
from the pipe or test plates of the same material as the pipe, the 
test plates being attached to the end of the cylinder and welded 
as a prolongation of the pipe longitudinal seam. 
12.3 Hydrostatic Test-Each length of pipe shall be sub­
jected to the hydrostatic test in accordance with Specification 
A999/ A999M. 
13. Product Marking 
13.1 In addition to the marking specified in Specification 
A999/ A999M, the marking shall include the manufacturer's 
identifying mark and double-welded pipe shall be identified 
with the mark (DW). For Grades TP304H, TP316H, TP321H, 
TP347H, TP348H, and S30815, the marking shall also include 
the heat number and heat-treatment lot identification. If speci­
fied in the purchase order, the marking for pipe larger than NPS 
4 shall include the weight.
