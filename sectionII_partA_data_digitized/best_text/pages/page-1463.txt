8 Product analysis limits for cobalt under 0.05 % have not been established and 
the producer should be consulted for those limits. 
°No over tolerance allowed. 
9.4 When parts are machined from bar or seamless tubing, 
as permitted in 6.1.1 and 6.1.2, the mechanical properties may 
be determined for the parts from the starting material, if the 
parts have not been subjected to any subsequent thermal 
processing since the time of mechanical test. 
10. Hardness Requirements 
10.1 The part shall conform to the hardness requirements 
prescribed in the product specification. 
10.2 Sampling for hardness testing shall conform to the 
product specification. 
11. Tensile Requirements 
11.1 Sampling for tensile testing shall conform to the 
Product Specification. 
11.2 When the dimensions of the material to be tes_ted will 
permit, the tension test specimens shall be machined to 
standard round 2-in. gauge length tension test specimen de­
scribed in Test Methods and Definitions A370 if inch-pound 
units are specified or the standard gauge length tension test 
specimens described in the applicable track of Test Methods 
A1058 if SI units are specified. 
11.3 In the case of small sections, which will not permit 
taking of the standard test specimen described in 11.2, the 
subsize round specimen shall be machined. The tension test 
specimen shall be as large as feasible. 
11.4 The results of the tensile tests shall conform to the 
tensile property requirements prescribed in the product speci­
fication. 
11.5 If the results of tension tests do not conform to the 
requirements specified in the product specification, a retest 
shall be permitted on twice the number of test specimens as 
originally tested as outlined in the test methods specified 
herein. When any retest. specimen does not conform to the 
product specification requirements for the characteristic in 
question, the lot represented by that specimen shall be rejected 
or reheat treated in accordance with Section 7. 
11.5.1 If the results of any tension test specimen are less 
than specified because a flaw becomes evident in the test 
specimen during testing, a replacement test specimen shall be 
allowed provided that the defect is not attributable to ruptures, 
cracks, or flakes in the steel. 
12. Impact Requirements 
12.1 The part shall conform to the impact requirements 
prescribed in the product specification. 
12.2 Sampling for impact testing shall conform to the 
Product Specification. 
12.3 Notched-bar impact specimens shall be simple-beam, 
Charpy-type A with a V-notch in accordance with Test Methods 
and Definitions A370 if the inch-pound units are specified or 
Test Methods A1058 if the M suffix (SI Units) standard is 
specified. Standard specimens 10 by 10 mm in cross section 
shall be used unless the material to be tested is of insufficient 
thickness, in which case the largest obtainable standard subsize 
impact specimens shall be used. When the size or shape of the
