5.3 When specified on the order, sample forging may be 
sectioned and etched to show flow lines and the condition in 
regard to internal imperfections. When so specified, the 
question of acceptable and unacceptable metal flow shall 
be subject to agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser prior to order entry. 
5.4 When specified on the order, the manufacturer shall 
submit for approval of the purchaser a sketch showing the 
shape of the rough forging before machining, or before 
heat treating for mechanical properties. 
5.5 The grain size shall be as fine as practicable and 
precautions shall be taken to minimize grain growth. 
5.6 Material of types other than XM-9 shall be fur­
nished in the solution-annealed condition, or in the equal­
ized and over-tempered condition, as noted in Table 2 
unless otherwise specified by the purchaser. ' 
5.6.1 Types 630, XM-16, and XM-25 may be fur­
nished in the solution-annealed or age-hardened condition. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical composition 
limits specified in Table 1. 
6.2 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with 
Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A 751. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7 .1 The material, as represented by mechanical test 
specimens, shall conform to the mechanical property 
requirements specified in Table 2 and shall be capable of 
developing the properties in Table 3 when heat treated as 
specified in Table 3. 
7 .2 The yield strength shall be determined by the offset 
method as described in the current edition of Test Methods 
and Definitions A 370. The limiting permanent offset shall 
be 0.2% of the gage length of the specimen. 
7.3 The impact strength shall be determined at 70 to 
80°F [20 to 25°C], by Charpy V-notch specimen Type A 
as described in Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
7 .4 Material tensile tested and, when specified, impact 
tested in the transverse direction (perpendicular to the forg­
ing flow lines) and meeting the requirements shown in 
Table 3 need not be tested in the longitudinal direction. 
7.5 Samples cut from forging shall conform to the 
mechanical properties of Table 3 when heat treated as 
specified in Table 2 and Table 3 and tested in accordance 
with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
8. Prolongations for Tests 
8.1 Subject to Section 7, the forgings shall be produced 
with prolongations for testing, unless otherwise. specified. 
The producer may elect to submit an extra forging to repre­
sent each test lot instead of prolongations, or the test speci­
mens can be taken from the forgings themselves. 
9. Number of Tests 
9.1 For all classes of forgings weighing from 5000 to 
7000 lb [2300 to 3200 kg] each, at least one tension test 
shall be made from each forging. 
9.2 For all classes of forgings weighing more than 7000 
lb [3200 kg] each, one tension test shall be made from 
each end of each forging. In the case of ring forgings, the 
tension test specimen shall be removed from each of two 
locations on the periphery, approximately 180° apart, or 
insofar as practicable, from opposite ends of the forging. 
9.3 For forgings weighing less than 5000 lb [2300 
kg] each, one tension test shall be made from each size 
classification for each heat . in each heat treating charge. 
Where continuous heat treating furnaces are used, tests 
shall be made on 10% of the forgings of each size classifi­
cation from each heat subjected to the same heat treatment 
practice.
