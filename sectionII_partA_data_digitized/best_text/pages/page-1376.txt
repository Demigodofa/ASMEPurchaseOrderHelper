SA-813/SA-813M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Single- or Double-Welded Austenitic Stainless Steel Pipe 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers two classes of fit-up and 
alignment quality straight-seam single- or double-welded aus­
tenitic steel pipe intended for high-temperature and general 
corrosive service. 
Nom 1-When the impact test criterion for a low-temperature service 
would be 15 ft-lbf [20 J] energy absorption or 15 mils [0.38 mm] lateral 
expansion, some of the austenitic stainless steel grades covered by this 
specification are accepted by certain pressure vessel or piping codes 
without the necessity of making the actual test. For example, Grades 304, 
304L, and 347 are accepted by the ASME Pressure Vessel Code, Section 
VIII Division 1, and by the Chemical Plant and Refinery Piping Code, 
ANSI.B31.3 for service at temperatures as low as -425 °F [-250 °C] 
without qualification by impact tests. Other AISI stainless steel grades are 
usually accepted for service temperatures as low as -325 °F [-200 °C] 
without impact testing. Impact testing may, under certain circumstances, 
be required. For example, materials with chromium or nickel content 
outside the AISI ranges, and for material with carbon content exceeding 
0.10 %, are required to be impact tested under the rules of ASME Section 
VIII Division 1 when service temperatures are lower than -50 °F [-45 °C] 
1.2 Grades TP304H, TP304N, TP316H, TP316N, TP321H, 
TP347H, and TP348H are modifications of Grades TP304, 
TP316, TP321, TP347, and TP348, and are intended for 
high-temperature service. 
1.3 Two classes of pipe are covered as follows: 
1.3.1 Class SW-Pipe, single-welded with no addition of 
filler metal and 
1.3.2 Class DW-Pipe, double-welded with no addition of 
filler metal. 
1.4 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for 
pipe where a greater degree of testing is desired. These 
supplementary requirements call for additional tests to be made 
and, when desired, one or more of these may be specified in the 
order. 
1.5 Table 1 lists the dimensions of welded stainless steel 
pipe as shown in ANSI B36.19. Pipe having other dimensions 
may be furnished provided such pipe complies with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
