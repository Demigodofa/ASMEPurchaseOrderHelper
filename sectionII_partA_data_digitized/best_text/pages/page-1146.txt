SA-638/SA-638M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR PRECIPITATION HARDENING 
IRON BASE SUPERALLOY BARS, FORGINGS, AND 
FORGING STOCK FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE SERVICE 
SA-638/SA-638M 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 638/ A 638M-00(2004) except for an editorial correction in 6.2.] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers hot-finished or cold-fin­
ished precipitation hardening iron base superalloy bars, 
forgings, and forging stock for high-temperature service. 
The mechanical properties of these alloys are developed 
by suitable solution treating and precipitation hardening 
treatments. 
1.2 Two grades of iron base alloy are covered. Selection 
will depend upon design, service conditions, mechanical 
properties, and elevated temperature characteristics. 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
(metric) units are to be regarded separately as standards; 
within the text and tables, the SI units are shown in [brack­
ets]. The values stated in each system are not exact equiva­
lents; therefore, each system must be used independent of 
the other. Combining values from the two systems may 
result in nonconformance with the specification. 
1.4 Unless the order specifies an "M" designation, the 
material shall be furnished to inch-pound units.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify 
all requirements that are necessary for material ordered 
under this specification. Such requirements may include, 
but are not limited to, the following: 
3.1.1 . Quantity (weight or number of pieces). 
3.1.2 Name of material (precipitation hardening iron 
base superalloy). 
3.1.3 Form (bars, forgings, and forging stock). 
3.1.4 Dimensions (in the case of rough or finished 
forgings the order shall be accompanied by a print or 
drawing or otherwise adequately described as to the shape 
and dimension). 
3.1.5 Grade designation (Table 1). 
3.1.6 Condition (Section 5). 
3.1.7 Finish (Section 3). 
3.1.8 Mechanical requirements (Section 8). 
3.1.9 ASTM designation. 
3.1.10 Special requirements. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 In addition to the requirements of this specification, 
all requirements of the current edition of Specification 
A 484/A 484M shall apply. Failure to comply with the 
general requirements of Specification A 484 / A 484M con­
stitutes nonconformance with this specification. 
5. Condition 
5.1 The product forms covered in this specification 
may be furnished in one of the following conditions: 
5.1.1 Hot-finished. 
5.1.2 Solution treated (Grade 660 only - Type 1 
or Type 2 solution treatment as specified).
