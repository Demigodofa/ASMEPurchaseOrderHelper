[3.8 mm] specified 
A When tubes as ordered require wall thicknesses ¾ in. [19 mm] or over, or an Inside diameter 60 % or less of the outside diameter, a wider variation in wall thickness 
is required. On such sizes a variation in average wall thickness of 12.5 % over or under, or a variation in minimum wall thickness of 25.0 % over and O % under, shall be 
permitted. 
For tubes less than ½ in. [12.7 mm] in inside diameter that cannot be successfully drawn over a mandrel, the average wall thickness may vary ±15 % from that specified 
or the minimum wall thickness may vary by +30 %, -0 % from that specified. 
8 These tolerances apply to cut lengths up to and including 24 ft [7.3 m]. For lengths greater than 24 ft [7.3 m], the above over-tolerances shall be increased by ¼ in. [3 
mm] for each 10 ft [3 m] or fraction thereof over 24 ft or½ in. [13 mm], whichever Is the lesser. 
0 OVality provisions of 12.2 apply. 
0 Applicable to tubing specified as average wall (see 3.1.4). 
E Applicable to tubing specified as minimum wall (see 3.1.4). 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirement shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the 
inquiry, contract, or order. 
Sl. Pneumatic Test 
S 1.1 The tubing shall be examined by a pneumatic test 
(either air underwater or pneumatic leak test) in accordance 
with Specification A1016/A1016M.
