SA-20/SA-Z0M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
12.1.2 Orientation of Test Specimens-The long axis of the 
test specimens shall be oriented either longitudinal (parallel to 
the final direction of rolling) or transverse (transverse to the 
final direction of rolling), as specified in the applicable product 
specification or the purchase order. 
12.1.3 Location of Test Coupons-The impact test coupons 
shall be taken adjacent to the tension test coupons. The impact 
test coupons shall be subject to the same requirements as those 
specified for tension tests in 11.4, except that the provisions of 
11.4.4.1 apply to the area under the notch of the impact test 
specimen instead of to the gage length of the tension test 
specimen. 
12.1.4 Test Method-Impact testing shall be performed in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370 using 
Charpy V-notch (Type A) specimens as shown in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370. Except as allowed by 12.1.4.1, full-size 
specimens (0.394 by 0.394 in. [10 by 10 mm]) shall be used if 
the plate thickness permits, and their central axis shall corre­
spond as near as practical to the ¼ t plane in the plate thickness 
t. If the plate thickness is insufficient to obtain full-size 
specimens, the largest possible subsize specimens shall be 
used. 
12.1.4.1 For plates that normally have absorbed energy 
values in excess of 180 ft-lbf [245 J] if tested using full-size 
specimens at the specified testing temperature, subsize 0.394 
by 0.264 in. [10 by 6.7 mm] specimens may be used in lieu of 
full-size specimens; however, if this option is used, the 
acceptance value shall be 75 ft-lbf [100 J] minimum for each 
test specimen and the lateral expansion in mils [micrometres] 
shall be reported. 
12.1.5 Test Temperature-The test temperature shall be as 
specified by the product specification, if applicable, or by the 
purchaser, except that the manufacturer or processor shall have 
the option of using a lower test temperature. The actual test 
temperature used shall be reported with the test results. 
12.1.6 Acceptance Criteria-The acceptance criteria shall 
be as specified by the product specification, if applicable, or the 
purchaser. 
12.1.6.1 If the acceptance criteria is based upon energy 
absorption of a full-size specimen, the acceptance criteria for 
the various subsize specimens shall be as given in TableAl.16 
[A2.16], except as otherwise provided in 12.1.4.1. 
12.1.6.2 If the acceptance criterion is based upon lateral 
expansion opposite the notch, the acceptance value shall be the 
same for all sizes of test specimens. 
12.1.7 Marking-The letters "LTV" shall be stenciled or 
stamped on each plate following the class number, grade, etc. 
12.1.8 Variability-The impact properties of steel can vary 
within the same plate-as-rolled or piece, be it as-rolled, 
control-rolled, or heat-treated. The purchaser should, therefore, 
be aware that testing of one plate-as-rolled does not provide 
assurance that all locations within a plate-as-rolled will be 
identical in toughness with the location tested. Normalizing or 
quenching and tempering the product will reduce the degree of 
variation. 
12.1.8.1 Appendix X3 provides additional information on 
the variability of Charpy V-notch test properties in plates for 
pressure vessels.

12.2 Drop-Weight Tests: 
12.2.1 Where specified, one drop-weight test, consisting of 
a set of two test specimens, shall be made to the same 
frequency stated in 12.1.1 in accordance with Test Method 
E208. 
12.2.2 The test coupons shall be obtained adjacent to a 
tension test coupon. For plates produced from coil, the test 
coupon locations shall be the same as for Charpy V-notch tests. 
(See 12.1.) The provisions of 12.1.3 shall also apply. 
12.2.3 The testing temperature shall be as specified in the 
applicable product specification or the purchase order. 
12.2.4 Acceptance shall be on the basis of no-break perfor­
mance of both test specimens at the specified testing tempera­
ture. 
12.2.5 The plates shall be marked as required in 12.1.7, 
except that the letters "LTD" shall be used instead of "LTV." 
13. Identification of Plates 
13.1 Required Markings: 
13.1.1 Except as allowed by 13.4, plates shall be legibly 
marked with the following information: applicable ASTM 
designation (see 1.1) (year of issue not required); "G" or" MT" 
if applicable (see 13.1.2); applicable grade, type, and class; 
heat number; plate identifier; and name, brand, or trademark of 
the manufacturer (for plates produced in discrete cut lengths of 
flat product) or the processor (for plates produced from coil and 
for subdivided plates (see 13.4)). 
13.1.2 Plates that are required to be heat treated, but have 
not been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the manufacturer 
or processor, with the letter "G" ( denoting green) following the 
required ASTM designation mark, except that "G" marking is 
not necessary if such plates are for shipment, for the purpose of 
obtaining the required heat treatment, to an organization under 
the manufacturer's control. Plates that are required to be heat 
treated, and have been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the 
party that performed the heat treatment, with the letters "MT" 
( denoting material treated) following the required ASTM 
designation mark. 
Norn 2-Any stress relief of test specimens intended to simulate 
post-weld heat treatment is not included in the above heat treatment. 
13.2 Types of Marking: 
13.2.1 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates over ¼ in. [6 mm] in thickness shall be by steel die 
stamping, unless paint marking is specified in the purchase 
order. 
13.2.2 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates ¼ in. [6 mm] and under in thickness shall be by paint 
marking or by steel die stamping using low-stress (either 
round-nose or interrupted-dot) impressions. 
13.3 Location of Markings: 
13.3.1 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates with a maximum lengthwise or crosswise dimension 
more than 72 in. [1800 mm] shall be in at least two places on 
each finished plate, at least 12 in. [300 mm] from the edges of 
the plate. 
13.3.2 Except as allowed by 13.4, the required markings for 
plates with a maximum lengthwise and crosswise dimension of
