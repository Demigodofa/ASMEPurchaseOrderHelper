5.1.3 Solution and precipitation treated (Grade 660 
only-Type 1 or Type 2 solution treatment as specified), or 
5.1.4 Other as specified. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 Samples cut from bars, forgings, or a sample forged 
from the forging stock shall conform to the mechanical 
properties of Tables 1 and 2 when heat treated as prescribed 
in Table 3. 
6.2 When a sample cut from the forging stock and heat 
treated as prescribed in Table 3 conforms to the properties 
in Tables 1 and 2, it shall be accepted as equivalent to a 
forged coupon. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The steel shall conform to the requirements for 
chemical composition specified in Table 4. 
7 .2 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with 
Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A 751, except 
that for remelt material, product analysis tolerances may 
be used to determine conformance to this specification. 
7 .3 For referee purposes, Test Methods E 30 shall be 
used. 
7 .4 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with 
Test Methods, Practices, and Definitions A 7 51, except that 
for remelt material, product analysis tolerances may be 
used to determine conformance to this specification. 
8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 The material shall conform to the mechanical prop­
erty requirements specified in Table 1 after heat treatment 
as described in Table 3. 
8.2 The material shall meet the requirements as to 
stress-rupture properties specified in Table 2 at the test 
temperature indicated after heat treatment as described in 
Table 3. 
8.3 When specified in the ordering information (3.1.8), 
material may be ordered without stress-rupture testing. 
Material not stress-rupture tested shall be permanently 
stamped NR (See Section 10). 
9. Metallurgical Properties 
9.1 When specified, the grain size shall be 1 or finer. 
10. Product Marking 
10.1 Unless otherwise specified on the purchase order, 
each bundle shall be properly tagged with metal tags show­
ing the purchase order number, heat number, name of alloy 
( or grade), "NR" when material has not been stress-rupture 
tested, specification number, and size. 
10.1.1 Bars 1 in. [25 mm] and over in diameter, or 
1 in. [25 mm] and over in thiclmess between parallel sides, 
shall be stamped with the heat number, and if not stress­
rupture tested, with the letters "NR" within approximately 
2 in. [50 mm] of one end. Smaller sizes shall be boxed or 
bundled and identified with metal tags as described in 10.1. 
10.1.2 Forgings shall be identified as agreed upon 
between the seller and the purchaser.
