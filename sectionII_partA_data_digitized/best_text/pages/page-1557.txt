A Where an ellipsis ( ... ) appears in the table, there is no requirement. 
8 For coil products, testing by the producer is limited to the end of the coil. Mechanical properties throughout the coil shall comply with the minimum values specified. 
testing is performed on a per-coil basis, only one test shall be 
made for each master coil. 
(1) Requirements specified in 8.2.3.2 are minimum testing 
requirements. Additional testing may be performed at the 
producer's option, or upon agreement between producer and 
user or seller and purchaser. 
(2) Testing of non-strength required grades may also be 
performed as described in 8.2.3.2, for each specific non­
strength grade ordered. 
8.2.3.3 Tension test specimens shall be taken at a point 
immediately adjacent to the material to be qualified. 
8.2.3.4 Tension test specimens shall be taken from the full 
thickness of the sheet. 
8.2.3.5 Tension test specimens shall be taken from a loca­
tion approximately halfway between the center of the sheet and 
the edge of the material as rolled. 
8.2.3.6 Tension test samples shall be taken with the length­
wise axis of the test specimen parallel to the rolling direction 
(longitudinal test). 
8.2.3.7 Test Method-Yield strength shall be determined by 
either the 0.2 % offset method or the 0.5 % extension under 
load method unless otherwise specified. 
8.2.3.8 Bake hardenable steel shall conform to bake hard­
ening index requirements included in Table 5 for the grade 
specified. The method for measuring the bake hardening index 
is described in Annex Al. Bake hardenable steel shall exhibit 
a minimum increase in yield strength of 4 ksi [25 MPa] as 
based on the upper yield point or 3 ksi [20 MPa] as based on 
the lower yield stress, after a prestrained specimen has been 
exposed to a standard bake cycle (340 °F [170 °C]) for 20 min. 
8.2.4 Bending Properties: 
8.2.4.l The suggested minimum inside radii for cold bend­
ing are listed in Appendix Xl and is discussed in more detail 
in Specification A568/A568M (Section 6). Where a tighter 
bend radius is required, where curved or offset bends are 
involved, or where stretching or drawing are also a 
consideration, the producer shall be consulted. 
8.3 RHS and FHS: 
8.3.1 The available hardness grades for RHS and FHS are 
shown in Table 6. 
8.3.2 The steel represented by RHS grades and FHS shall 
meet the specified hardness shown in Table 6, as determined at 
the time of shipment. 
8.3.2.1 Based on chemistry and processing parameters such 
as method of annealing ( continuous or box annealing), and 
rolling practice, RHS grades may be subject to aging and 
potentially exhibit greater hardness when tested at a later date. 
8.3.2.2 Due to the non-recrystallized microstructure, FHS is 
not expected to be subject to aging. 
8.3.3 Hardness testing shall be performed by the producer, 
at the final processing step, prior to shipment, at a location not 
less than 1 in. [25 mm] from the edge of the sheet. 
9. Finish and Appearance 
9.1 Surface Finish: 
9.1.1 Unless otherwise specified, the sheet shall have a 
matte finish. When required, specify the appropriate surface 
texture and condition. For additional information, see the 
Finish and Condition section of Specification A568/A568M 
(may not apply when steel is ordered full hard (FHS), since the 
final process step is typically the cold reduction mill). For 
additional information see "Finish and Condition" section of 
Specification A568/ A568M. 
9.2 Oiling: 
9.2.1 Unless otherwise specified, the sheet shall be oiled 
(may not apply when steel is ordered full hard (FHS), since the 
final process step is typically the cold reduction mill). 
9.2.2 When required, specify the sheet to be furnished not 
oiled (dry). 
10. Retests and Disposition of Non-Conforming Material 
10.1 Retests, conducted with the requirements of Subsec­
tion 11.1 of Specification A568/ A568M, are permitted when an 
unsatisfactory test result is suspected to be the consequence of 
the test method procedure. 
10.2 Disposition of non-conforming material shall be sub­
ject to the requirements of Subsection 11.2 of Specification 
A568/ A568M.
