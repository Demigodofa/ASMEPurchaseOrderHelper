SA-572/SA-572M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
High-Strength Low-Alloy Columbium-Vanadium Structural 
Steel 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers five grades of high-strength 
low-alloy structural steel shapes, plates, sheet piling, and bars. 
Grades 42 [290], 50 [345], and 55 [380] are intended for 
riveted, bolted, or welded structures. Grades 60 [415] and 65 
[ 450] are intended for riveted or bolted construction of bridges, 
or for riveted, bolted, or welded construction in other applica­
tions. 
1.2 For applications, such as welded bridge construction, 
where notch toughness is important, notch toughness require­
ments are to be negotiated between the purchaser and the 
producer. 
1.3 Specification A588/A588M shall not be substituted for 
Specification A572/ A572M without agreement between the 
purchaser and the supplier. 
1.4 The use of columbium (niobium), vanadium, titanium, 
nitrogen, or combinations thereof, within the limitations noted 
in Section 5, is required; the selection of type (1, 2, 3, or 5) is 
at the option of the producer, unless otherwise specified by the 
purchaser. (See Supplementary Requirement S90.) 
1.5 The maximum thicknesses available in the grades and 
products covered by this specification are shown in Table 1. 
1.6 When the steel is to be welded, a welding procedure 
suitable for the grade of steel and intended use or service is to 
be utilized. See Appendix X3 of Specification A6/ A6M for 
information on weldability. 
1.7 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system is to 
be used independently of the other, without combining values 
in any way. 
1.8 The text of this specification contains notes or footnotes, 
or both, that provide explanatory material. Such notes and 
footnotes, excluding those in tables and figures, do not contain 
any mandatory requirements. 
1.9 For structural products produced from coil and fur­
nished without heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the 
additional requirements, including additional testing require­
ments and the reporting of additional tests, of Specification 
A6/ A6M apply. 
1.10 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
