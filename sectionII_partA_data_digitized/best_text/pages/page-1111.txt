Use optical evaluation in 12.3.2 
12.3.3.1 Take measurements at minor diameter 
(Reading No. 1) on the thread crest bisector to determine 
base metal hardness. Take measurements (Reading No. 2) 
on the bisector 0.75h from the minor measurement toward 
the thread crest. Also take measurements (Reading No. 3) 
on the thread flank at the pitch line at a depth within 0.003 
from the surface. Reading No. 3 may be taken on the same 
or an adjacent thread. 
12.3.4 Interpret microhardness readings as follows: 
12.3.4.1 A decrease of more than 30 hardness 
points from Reading No. 1 to Reading No. 2 shall be 
regarded as decarburization and indicates the screw does 
not conform to specification requirements. 
12.3.4.2 An increase of more than 30 hardness 
points from Reading No. 1 to Reading No. 3 shall be 
regarded as carburization and indicates that the screw does 
not conform to specification requirements.
