32.1.10 Tube shall be straight to within the tolerances 
specified in Table 8: 
32.1.11 When specified, each tube shall be ultrasonically 
examined in accordance with NAVSEA T9074-AS-GIB-010/ 
271, except that the notch depth in the calibration standard 
shall be 5 % of the wall thickness or 0.005 in., whichever is 
greater. Any tube which produces an indication equal to or 
greater than 100 % of the indication from the calibration 
standard shall be rejected.

Specified Wall Maximum Maximum 
Specified OD (in.) Curvature in Any 3 Curvature in Total Thickness (in.) ft (in.) Length (in.) 
Up to 5.0, incl Over 3 % OD to 0.030 0.010 x length, ft 
0.5, incl 
Over 5.0 to 8.0, Over4 % OD to 0.045 0.015 x length, ft 
incl 0.75, incl 
Over 8.0 to 12.75, Over4% OD to 0.060 0.020 x length, ft

32.1.12 The tube shall be free from repair welds, welded 
joints, laps, laminations, seams, visible cracks, tears, grooves, 
slivers, pits, and other imperfections detrimental to the tube as 
determined by visual and ultrasonic examination, or alternate 
tests, as specified. 
32.1.13 Tube shall be uniform in quality and condition and 
have a finish confonning to the best practice for standard 
quality tubing. Surface imperfections such as handling marks, 
straightening marks, light mandrel and die marks, shallow pits, 
and scale pattern will not be considered injurious if the 
imperfections are removable within the tolerances specified for 
wall thickness or 0.005 in., whichever is greater. The bottom of 
imperfections shall be visible and the profile shall be rounded 
and faired-in. 
32.1.14 No weld repair by the manufacturer is permitted. 
32.1.15 Packaging, marking, and loading shall be in accor­
dance with Practices A700 or Practice D3951.
