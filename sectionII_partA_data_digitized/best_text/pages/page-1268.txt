SA-727 /SA-727M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Carbon Steel Forgings for Piping Components with Inherent 
Notch Toughness 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers forged carbon steel piping 
components intended primarily for service in pressure piping 
systems from -20 to +650 °F [-30 to +345 °C] where inherent 
notch toughness is desired, but where notch toughness testing 
is not required. Included are forged or ring-rolled flanges, 
forged fittings, and valves made to specified dimensions, or to 
dimensional standards such as the ASME and API specifica­
tions referenced in Section 2. 
1.2 This specification is limited to forgings with maximum 
finished section thicknesses no larger than 2 in. [51 mm]. 
1.3 It shall be the responsibility of the purchaser to deter­
mine whether material meeting the requirements of this speci­
fication is satisfactory for the service application. 
1.4 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when 
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply 
only when specified by the purchaser in the order. 
NOTE 1-There are no provisions for impact testing in this specifica­
tion. When impact testing is required, refer to Specification A350/A350M. 
1.5 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
