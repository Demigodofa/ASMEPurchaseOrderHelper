mm] thick; and 3/26 in. [4.8 mm] long for materials 2 in. [50 
mm] thick and greater. A linear indication is defined as one 
whose length is three times its width. 
7 .2.1.2 Rounded indications with dimensions greater than 
1/s in. [3.2 mm] for thicknesses less than 5/s in. [16 mm], and 
greater than 3 /16 in. [4.8 mm] for thicknesses 5/s in. [16 mm] and 
greater. 
7.2.1.3 Four or more relevant indications in a line separated 
by 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] or less, edge to edge. 
7.2.1.4 Ten or more relevant indications in any 6 in.2 [3870 
mm 2 ] of surface with the major dimension of this area not to 
exceed 6 in. [150 mm] when it is taken in the most unfavorable 
orientation relative to the indications being evaluated. 
8. Rework and Retreatment 
8.1 Repair welding shall not be permitted. For retreatment, 
see 7.2.1. 
9. Certification and Reports 
9.1 In addition to the certification requirements of Specifi­
cation A788/A788M, the manufacturer shall include the fol­
lowing in the certification data: 
9 .1.1 Results of the product analysis, 
9.1.2 Method used to locate mechanical test specimens (see 
Section 6), and 
9.1.3 Sketches or drawings as necessary to supplement the 
nondestructive examination report. 
10. Packaging and Package Marking 
10.1 Marking shall be in accordance with Specification 
A788/A788M but stamping shall be permitted only in areas 
designated by the purchaser. If no such suitable area is 
available, a separate nameplate, with the required stamping, 
shall be permanently affixed to the vessel in a manner that will 
not be injurious to the vessel. 
11. Keywords 
11.1 alloy steel forgings; high pressure vessels; high 
strength; impact tested; isostatic presses; nonweldable; 
quenched and tempered; vacuum-treated steel 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the 
purchaser in the inquiry or order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be agreed upon 
by the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
Sl. Charpy V-Notch Impact Transition Curve 
S 1.1 Sufficient impact tests shall be made from the forging 
test material to establish a temperature-absorbed energy curve. 
The test temperature range shall be wide enough to establish 
the upper and lower shelf foot-pound-force energies, with 
sufficient testing at intermediate temperatures to permit plot­
ting a reasonably smooth curve. 
S 1.2 Instead of plotting an impact transition curve, impact 
requirements may be specified as 50 % fibrous fracture at a 
specified maximum temperature. 
S2. Additional Charpy Data 
S2.1 The percent shear fracture and mils of lateral 
expansion, defined in Test Methods and Definitions A370, shall 
be reported for each Charpy specimen tested. 
S3. Charpy Impact Tests 
S3.l Charpy impact tests shall be made in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 6 of this specification, except that the 
tests shall be at a specified temperature lower than 40°F 
[4.5°C]. These tests shall be instead of those specified in 
Section 6, and shall meet the requirements of Table 3. 
S4. Impact Testing 
S4.1 For Class 2a forgings, impact tests shall be made in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of this specifica­
tion except that the acceptance criteria shall be a minimum of 
45 ft-lbf [61 J] and 25 mils [0.635 mm] lateral expansion at a 
test temperature specified by the purchaser. 
SS. Mechanical Test Location Discard 
S5.1 Instead of the discard of¼ T x 2 /2 T required by 6.2.3, 
a minimum discard of ¼ T x T shall be employed for Method 
3. 
S6. Alternate Mechanical Testing 
S6; 1 Forgings exeeding 5000 lb [2270kg] at the time of heat 
treatment, and not over 80 in. [2030 mm] in length, excluding 
test material, require one set of test specimens to be taken from 
each end of the forging. Each test specimen set shall consist of 
one tension test and three Charpy V-notch specimens. The test 
specimen set locations shall be spaced 180° apart, end to end. 
When the forging length exceeds 80 in. [2030 mm] excluding 
test material two sets of mechanical test specimens shall be 
removed from each end of the forging, and spaced 180° apart 
at the same end, and rotated 90° end to end.
