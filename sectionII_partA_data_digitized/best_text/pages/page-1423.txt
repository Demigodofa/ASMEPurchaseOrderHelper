ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
Also listed are additional supplementary requirements suitable for use with this specification. 
S55. Longitudinal Charpy Impact Energy Absorption Re­
quirement 
S55.1 Longitudinal Charpy V-notch tests shall be made in 
accordance with Specification A20/A20M. Unless the test 
temperature is specified in the purchase order, the tests shall be 
conducted at -320°F [-195°C] and the average absorbed 
energy for each set of three full size specimens shall be 25 ft-lb 
[34 JJ or more, and the individual test value of not more than 
one specimen may be below 25 ft-lb [34 J], but in no case 
below 20 ft-lb [27 J]. 
S56. Transverse Charpy Impact Energy Absorption Re­
quirement 
S56.1 Transverse Charpy V-notch tests shall be made in 
accordance with Specification A20/A20M. Unless the test 
temperature is specified in the purchase order, the tests shall be 
conducted at -320°F [-195°CJ and the average absorbed 
energy for each set of three full size specimens shall be 20 ft-lb 
[27 J] or more, and th.e individual test value of not more than 
one specimen may be below 20 ft-lb [27 J], but in no case 
below 15 ft-lb [20 JJ. 
S64. Heat Treatment Parameters for Grad G 
S64.1 Except for the TMR-I-T process, the plates shall be 
cooled directly after rolling without being allowed to cool 
below 1025°F [550°CJ. Quenching hardening shall be initiated 
from a temperature within the range from 1025 to 1490°F [550 
to 810°C]. 
S64.2 Subsequent to quenching, the plates shall be tem­
pered within the range from 1030 to 1155°F [555 to 625°C], 
holding at that temperature for a minimum of 30 min/in. [1.2 
min/mm] of thickness but for not less than 15 min, and then 
cooling at a rate of not less than 300°F/h [165°C/h], either in 
air or by quenching in water, to ambient temperature. 
S64.3 Prior to the tempering treatment, the plates may be 
subjected to an intermediate heat treatment (Note S64.1) 
consisting of heating to a temperature in the range from 1185 
to 1310°F [640 to 710°C], holding at that temperature for a 
minimum of 1 hr/in. [2.4 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case 
less than 15 min, and then water-quenching to below 300°F 
[150°C] in the case of plate thicknesses of more than 5/s in. [16 
mm]; or cooling in air or water-quenching in the case of plate 
thickness of 5/s in. [16 mm] and under. 
NOTE S64.1-The intermediate heat treatment is for the purpose of 
enhancing elongation and notch-toughness and for reducing susceptibility 
to strain-aging embrittlement and temper embrittlement. It may be 
performed at the option of the material manufacturer or may be specified 
by the purchaser. 
S64.4 Heat treatment temperatures and times shall be re­
ported in accordance with Section 19 of Specification A20/ 
A20M. 
S77. Carbon Equivalent Limit 
S77.1 The carbon equivalent, on heat analysis, shall not 
exceed the limits listed in this section when based on the 
following equation: 
CE= C+Mn/6+(Cr+Mo+V)l5+(Cu+Ni)l15% 
[Grade A] 
t = 2 in. [50 mm] and under in thickness 
t > 2 in. [50 mm] in thickness 
[Grade BJ 
t = 2 in. [50 mm] and under in thickness 
t > 2 in. [50 mm] In thickness
