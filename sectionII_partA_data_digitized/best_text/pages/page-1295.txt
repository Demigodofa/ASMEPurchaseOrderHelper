3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
Descriptions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 Steel Types: 
3.1.2 carbon steel - the designation for steel when 
no minimum content is specified or required for aluminum, 
chromium, cobalt, columbium, molybdenum, nickel, tita­
nium, tungsten, vanadium, zirconium, or any element 
added to obtain a desired alloying effect; when the specified 
minimum for copper does not exceed 0.40%; or when 
the maximum content specified for any of the following 
elements does not exceed the percentages noted; manga­
nese 1.65, silicon 0.60, or copper 0.60. 
Discussion - In all carbon steels small quantities of 
certain residual elements unavoidably retained from raw 
materials are sometimes found which are not specified or 
required, such as copper, nickel, molybdenum, chromium, 
etc. These elements are considered as incidental and are 
not normally determined or reported. 
3.1.3 high-strength, low-alloy steel - a specific 
group of steels in which higher strength, and in some cases 
additional resistance to atmospheric corrosion, are obtained 
by moderate amounts of one or more al\oying elements. 
3.1.4 Product Types: 
3.1.5 hot-rolled strip - manufactured by hot rolling 
billets or slabs to the required thickness. It may be produced 
single width or by rolling multiple width and slitting to 
the desired width. It can be supplied in coils or cut lengths 
as specified.

5. C11emical Composition 
5.1 Limits: 
5.1.1 The chemical composition shall be in accor­
dance with the applicable product specification. However, 
if other compositions are required for carbon steel, they 
shall be prepared in accordance with Appendix Xl. 
5.1.2 Where the material is used for fabrication by 
welding, care must be exercised in the selection of chemical 
composition or mechanical properties to ensure compatibil­
ity with the welding process and its effect on altering the 
properties. 
5.2 Cast or Heat (Formerly Ladle) Analysis: 
5.2.1 An analysis of each cast or heat of steel shall 
be made by the manufacturer to determine the percentage 
of elements specified or restricted by the applicable speci­
fication. 
5.2.2 When requested, cast or heat analysis for ele­
ments listed or required shall be reported to the purchaser 
or to his representative. 
5.3 Product, Check, or Verification Analysis: 
5.3.1 Nonkilled steels (such as capped or rimmed) 
are not technologically suited to product analysis due to 
the nonuniform character of their chemical composition 
and therefore, the tolerances in Table 1 do not apply. Prod­
uct analysis is appropriate on these types of steel only 
when misapplication is apparent or for copper when copper 
steel is specified. 
5.3.2 For steels other than nonkilled (capped or 
rimmed), product analysis may be made by the purchaser. 
The chemical analysis shall not vary from the limits speci­
fied by more than the amounts in Table 1. The several
