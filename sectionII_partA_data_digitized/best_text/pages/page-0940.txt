7.1.6.2 Method 2-¼ Tc by Tc. Specimens shall be re­
moved ¼ Tc from the nearest quenched surface and at least Tc 
from all other surfaces exclusive of the Tc dimension surfaces. 
Where this method of testing is employed, the following 
limitations for Tc shall generally apply: 
Grades 1 and 1 a 
Grades 2 Class 2 and 3 Class 2 
Grades 2 Class 1 and 3 Class 1 
Grade 4N Class 2 and 5 Class 2 
Grade 4N Class 1 and 5 Class 1

6 in. [150 mm], max 
8 in. [205 mm], max 
16 in. [405 mm], max 
30 in. [760 mm], max 
40 in. [1015 mm], max

20 in. [510 mm], max 
12 in. [305 mm], max 
7.1.6.3 Method 3-Test specimens shall be taken from a 
representative separate test forging made from the same heat of 
steel and shall receive substantially the same reduction and 
type of hot working as the production forgings that it represents 
and shall have the same Tc as the as-quenched production 
forgings. The separate test forging shall be heat treated in the 
same furnace charge and under the same conditions as the 
production forgings. Test specimens shall be removed from the 
region midway between the mid-thickness and the surface, and 
not closer than Tc to a second heat treated surface with the 
same limitation on forging thickness as in 7.1.6.2. 
Alternatively, an extra production forging of the same configu­
ration (right and left handed configurations being considered 
equivalent) as that ordered, may be tested as described in 
Method 2. 
7.1.6.4 Method 4-A thermal buffer ring, at least Tc by Tc 
in cross section, or segments of such a ring at least 3 Tc in 
length, shall be welded to the test"end of a forging prior to heat 
treatment for mechanical properties. The buffer material may 
be any weldable carbon or low-alloy steel and shall be joined 
to the forging with a partial-penetration type weld which 
completely seals the buffered surface. The test coupons shall be 
removed from the forging in the region buffered by the ring or 
ring segments. If ring segments are used, the test coupons shall 
be removed from the forging in the area under the buffer ring 
segment at a minimum distance of Tc from each end of that 
segment. In either case, the test specimens shall be located at 
a minimum distance of V2 in. [13 mm] from the buffered 
surface of the forging, and at least V4 Tc from a quenched 
surface of the forging. Where this method of testing is 
employed, the limitations for Tc given in 7.1.6.2 shall gener­
ally apply. 
NoTE 5-For forgings with a maximum Tc of 2 in. [50 mm], the 
specimens shall be taken at midthickness and at least 2 in. from a second 
surface. This provision is applicable to all four methods in 7 .1.6. 
7.1.7 Tension specimens shall be the standard 0.5 in. 
[12.5 mm] round by 2 in. [50 mm] gauge length, as shown in 
Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
7.2 Impact Test-The steel shall conform to the require­
ments of Table 3, or Supplementary Requirement SlO may be 
specified instead of these requirements. 
7.2.1 Number, Location, and Orientation of Specimens: 
7.2.1.1 One set of three Charpy V-notch specimens shall be 
taken from each tensile specimen location required in 7 .1.2. 
Orientation shall be the same as in 7 .1.4. When S 10 is 
specified, the required number of tests shall be governed by 
NB, NC, ND, NE, NF, or NG 2300, as applicable. 
7 .2.1.2 The requirements of 7 .1.3 also apply to impact 
specimens. 
7.2.1.3 The longitudinal axis and mid-length of the impact 
specimen shall be located similarly to the longitudinal axis of 
the tension test specimens as defined in 7.1.6. The axis of the 
notch shall be normal to the nearest heat-treated surface of the 
forging. When Supplementary Requirement S 10 is specified 
the orientation shall be governed by NB, NC, ND, NE, NF, or 
NG 2300. 
7.2.2 Impact specimens shall be Charpy V-notch as shown 
in Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
8. Workmanship and Quality Level Requirements 
8.1 See requirements in 9.1, 9.2.2, 9.3.1.1, and 9.3.2.2. 
9. Nondestructive Inspection Requirements 
9.1 General Requirements-Dimensional and visual 
inspections, and magnetic particle and ultrasonic inspection 
shall be conducted by the manufacturer. Forgings shall be free 
of cracks, thermal ruptures, or other injurious indications. 
9.2 Magnetic Particle Inspection: 
9.2.1 Following final machining by the manufacturer all 
accessible surfaces of each forging shall be examined by the 
continuous current magnetic particle method. This examination 
shall be in accordance with Practice A275/A275M unless the 
purchaser has required the use of the AC yoke in accordance 
with Practice A966/A966M instead (see 4.3.1).

9.2.2 The following conditions are subject to rejection or 
removal: 
9.2.2.1 Indications with major dimension exceeding 3/16 in. 
[4.8 mm]. 
9.2.2.2 Four or more indications exceeding V!6 in. [1.6 mm] 
in major dimensions that are aligned and separated by V16 in. 
[1.6 mm] or less end to end. 
9.2.2.3 Ten or more indications exceeding V16 in. [1.6 mm] 
in major dimensions contained in any 6 in.2 [39 cm 2 ] of 
surface, with the major dimension of this area not to exceed 
6 in. [150 mm]. The area shall be taken in the most unfavorable 
location relative to the indications being evaluated. 
9.3 Ultrasonic Inspection-Forgings shall be ultrasonically 
inspected in accordance with the procedures of Practice A388/ 
A388M. 
9.3.1 Longitudinal Wave Inspection: 
9.3.1.1 Unless otherwise specified by Supplementary Re­
quirement S2, the back reflection method of tuning shall be 
used in accordance with 7.2.2.1 of Practice A388/A388M. In 
addition to the reportable conditions in Section 7 of Practice 
A388/A388M, indications exceeding the resultant back reflec­
tion shall be recorded. The following conditions are considered 
rejectable: 
9.3.1.2 Complete loss of back reflection not associated with 
forging configuration or surface and accompanied by an 
indication of a discontinuity. For this purpose, a back reflection 
less than 5 % of full screen height shall be considered complete 
loss of back reflection.
