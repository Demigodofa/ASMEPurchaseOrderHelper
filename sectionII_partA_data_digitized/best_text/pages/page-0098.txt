A The permitted variations in length for split tees or angles are the same as those 
applicable to the section from which the tees or angles are split. 
8 The above permitted variations in depth of tees or angles include the permitted 
variations in depth for the beams or channels before splitting. Permitted variations 
in dimensions and straightness, as set up for the beams or channels from which 
these tees or angles are cut, apply, except 
straightness = 2 mm x length in metres

A Out-of-round is the difference between the maximum and minimum diameters of 
the bar, measured at the same transverse cross section. Out-of-square section is 
the difference in perpendicular distance between opposite faces, measured at the 
same transverse cross section. 
8 The permitted variation shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of a millimetre after 
calculation.
