ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-723/SA-723M 
4.3 Heat Treatment: 
4.3.1 Forgings shall be rough-machined prior to final heat 
treatment if it is necessary to reduce the mass to ensure full 
hardening or to meet the requirements of 6.2. The risk of 
cracking during heat treatment with high-hardenability steels 
of the type covered by this specification should be borne in 
mind when deciding on the degree of surface preparation 
before heat treatment. 
4.3.2 Heat Treatment for Mechanical Properties-Heat 
treatment shall consist of normalizing (which may be part of 
the preliminary treatment), reaustenitization, liquid quenching, 
and tempering. The forgings shall be quenched in a suitable 
liquid medium by spraying or immersion. Quenching shall be 
followed by tempering at a minimum temperature of 1000°F 
[540°C]. The minimum time at tempering temperature shall be 
½ h/in. [½ h/25 mm] of maximum section thickness, unless 
otherwise agreed between supplier and purchaser. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam­
pling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall 
comply with Table 1. 
5.1.1 Temper Embrittlement Control-The purchaser's at­
tention is drawn to Supplementary Requirement S24 in Speci­
fication A788/A788M for application of the J Factor which 
may be of assistance in the control of temper embrittlement in 
forgings produced to Specification A 723/ A 723M. 
5.2 Product Analysis-The manufacturer shall use the prod­
uct analysis provision of Specification A788/A788M to obtain 
a product analysis from a forging representing each heat or 
multiple heat. The purchaser may also make this determination 
in accordance with Specification A788/A788M. 
6. Mechanical Properties 
6.1 General Requirements-The forging shall conform to 
the requirements of Table 2 and Table 3. The largest obtainable 
tension test specimen as specified in Test Methods and Defi­
nitions A370 (that is, standard round 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] 
diameter specimen) shall be used. Charpy V-notch Type A 
impact specimens, as shown in Test Methods and Definitions 
A370, shall be used. 
6.2 Sampling-The mid-point of the gage length of tension 
test specimens and the area under the notch of impact speci­
mens shall be located in accordance with one of the following 
methods as specified by the purchaser, or suggested by the 
Carbon, max 
Manganese, max 
Phosphorus, max 
Sulfur, max 
Silicon, max 
Nickel 
Chromium 
Molybdenum 
Vanadium, max

supplier and approved by the purchaser. Wherever practical, all 
testing shall be from integral prolongations of the forging. 
6.2.1 Method I-This method shall always be used when 
the maximum quenched thickness does not exceed 4 in. [100 
mm]. Datum points of the specimens, as described in 6.2, shall 
be located in the forging or test forging (6.2.4) at mid-thickness 
and at least 1/3 T (Tis the maximum heat-treated thickness) 
from the quenched end surface or nearest adjacent surfaces. 
6.2.2 Method 2-t by 2t, where t is the distance from the 
area of significant loading (3.1) to the nearest quenched 
surface. However, the datum points of the specimens as 
described in 6.2 shall not be nearer to one quenched surface 
than¾ in. [20 mm] and to the second quenched surface than 1 
½ in. [40 mm]. When this method of testing is employed, 
forgings are usually manufactured in accordance with a 
purchaser-approved drawing showing prequenched dimensions 
and the location of mechanical test specimens. It is commonly 
used for disk-type forgings such as tube sheets and covers. 
6.2.3 Method 3-For maximum quenched thicknesses in 
excess of 4 in. [100 mm] as heat treated. Where this method of 
testing is employed, the datum points of the test specimen, as 
described in 6.2, shall be removed ¼ T from the nearest 
quenched surface and 2 /2 T from the quenched end surface or 
nearest adjacent surface. 
6.2.4 Method 4-Test specimens shall be taken from a 
representative separate test forging made from the same heat of 
steel, which shall receive substantially the same reduction and 
type of hot working, and have a cross section not less than the 
production forgings which it represents. It shall be heat treated 
in the same furnace charge and under the same conditions as 
the production forgings. The test specimen shall be removed 
using the Method 3 procedure. 
6.3 Thermal Buffers: 
6.3.1 Thermal buffer rings, at least Thy Tin cross section or 
sections of such a ring at least 3 Tin length, shall be welded to 
the test end(s) of a forging prior to heat treatment for 
mechanical properties. The buffer material may be any weld­
able carbon or low-alloy steel and shall be joined to the forging 
with a partial penetration-type weld which completely seals the 
buffered surface. The test coupons shall be removed from the 
forging in the region buffered by the ring or ring segments. If 
the latter are used, the test coupons shall be removed from the 
forging in the area under the center ½ of the buffer ring 
segment length. In either case, the test specimens shall be 
located at a minimum distance of ½ in. [13 mm] from the 
buffered surface of the forging and at least ¼ T from a 
quenched surface of the forging. Buffered weld areas must be 
at least 1 in. [25 mm] from any finished machining surface of 
the complete forging. 
6.3.2 Bearing in mind the characteristics of the base mate­
rials included in this specification, precautions should be taken, 
such as the use of pre- and post-weld heating and austenitic 
weld metal, to minimize the occurrence of crack-like defects. 
6.3.3 Approval of the purchaser should be obtained for the 
use of this method. 
6.4 Samples shall be removed from the forgings after 
quenching and tempering.
