S11. Charpy Impact Test 
S 11.1 Charpy impact test properties shall be determined on 
each heat from a set of three Charpy V-notch specimens. The 
test coupons shall be taken as specified for tension specimens 
in Section 11 and tested at a test temperature agreed upon by 
the manufacturer and purchaser. The acceptance requirements 
shall be either energy absorbed or lateral expansion or percent 
shear area, and shall be that agreed upon by the manufacturer 
and purchaser. Test specimens shall be prepared as Type A and 
tested in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
Sll.2 Absorbed Energy Value, of three specimens shall not 
be less than that agreed upon by the manufacturer and 
purchaser, with no more than one value permitted below the 
minimum average specified and no value permitted below the 
minimum specified for a single specimen. 
Sll.3 Lateral Expansion Value, shall be agreed upon by the 
manufacturer and purchaser. 
Sll.4 Percent Shear Area, shall be agreed upon by the 
manufacturer and purchaser.

S12. Drop Weight Test 
S12.1 Drop weight test properties shall be determined by 
preparing and testing either Type Pl, P2, or P3 specimens in 
accordance with Test Method E208. The test coupons shall be 
taken as specified for tension specimens in Section 11. The 
crack starter weld shall be deposited on the surface of the 
specimen which was nearest to the casting surface. Each test 
shall consist of at least two specimens tested at a temperature 
agreed upon by the manufacturer and purchaser. Each speci­
men shall exhibit a "no break" performance.
