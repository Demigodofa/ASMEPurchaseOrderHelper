SA-439/SA-439M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Austenitic Ductile Iron Castings 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers austenitic ductile iron castings, 
which are used primarily for their resistance to heat, conosion, 
and wear, and for other special purposes. 
1.2 Austenitic ductile iron, also known as austenitic nodular 
iron or austenitic spheroidal iron, is characterized by having its 
graphite substantially in a spheroidal form and substantially 
free of flake graphite. It contains some carbides and sufficient 
alloy content to produce an austenitic structure. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the standard. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for material to this specification shall include the 
following information: 
3.1.1 ASTM designation, 
3.1.2 Type of austenitic ductile iron required (see 6.1), 
3.1.3 Heat treatment options (see 4.3 - 4.6), 
3.1.4 DELETED 
3.1.5 Size and number of test bars required (see 9.1 - 9.4 
and 10.1), 
3.1.6 Special tests, if required (see 12.1), 
3.1.7 DELETED 
3.1.8 Different preparation for delivery requirements, if 
needed (see 15.1). 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 Melting may be done in any furnaces that produce 
castings meeting the chemical and mechanical requirements 
outlined in this specification. These include cupolas, air 
furnaces, electric furnaces, crucible furnaces, and so forth. 
Nodularizing and inoculation practice shall be optional with 
the foundry to produce a microstructure in accordance with 1.2 
and Test Method A24 7. 
4.2 Austenitic ductile iron castings may be supplied in 
either the as-cast or the heat-treated condition. 
4.3 By agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser, the castings may be stress relieved by heating to 
1150 to 1200 °F [620 to 650 °C] for not less than 1 h and not 
for more than 2 h per inch [25 mm] of thickness in the thickest 
section. Heating and cooling shall be uniform and shall not be 
more than 400 °FAl [220 °CA1] for castings less than 1 in. 
[25 mm] in maximum thickness and shall be not more than 
400 °FAl [220 °CA1] divided by the maximum section thick­
ness in inches [25 mm] for thicker castings. During the cooling
