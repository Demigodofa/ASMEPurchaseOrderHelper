Standards Worldwide 
(Identical with ASTM Specification A 232/ A 232M-91.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers the highest quality of 
round chromium-vanadium alloy steel valve spring wire, 
uniform in quality and temper, intended for the manufac­
ture of valve springs and other springs requiring high­
fatigue properties when used at moderately elevated tem­
peratures. This wire shall be either in the annealed and 
cold-drawn or oil-tempered condition as specified by the 
purchaser. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the inch-pound units are shown in brackets. The values 
stated in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, 
each system must be used independent of the other.

dated ________ _ 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel may be made by any commercially, 
accepted steel making process. The steel may be either 
ingot cast or strand cast. 
4.2 The finished wire shall be free from detrimental 
pipe and undue segregation. 
5. Chemical Requirements 
5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements for 
chemical composition specified in Table 2. 
5.2 Heat Analysis - Each heat of steel shall be analyzed 
by the manufacturer to determine the percentage of ele­
ments prescribed in Table 2. This analysis shall be made
