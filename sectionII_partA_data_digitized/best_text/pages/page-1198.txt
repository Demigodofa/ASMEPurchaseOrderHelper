6. General Requirements 
6.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the applicable requirements of the current edition of Specifi­
cation A530/A530M unless otherwise provided herein. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 Product Analysis of Plate-The pipe manufacturer shall 
make an analysis of each mill heat of plate material. The 
product analysis so determined shall meet the requirements of 
the plate specification to which the material was ordered. 
7 .2 Product Analysis of Weld-The pipe manufacturer shall 
make an analysis of the finished deposited weld material from 
each 500 ft [150 m] or fraction thereof. Analysis shall conform 
to the welding procedure for deposited weld metal. 
7.3 Analysis may be taken from the mechanical test speci­
mens. The results of the analyses shall be reported to the 
purchaser. 
7 .4 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 7 .1 or 7 .2 
does not conform to the requirements specified, analyses shall 
be made on additional pipes of double the original number 
from the same lot, each of which shall conform to the 
requirements specified. Nonconforming pipe shall be rejected. 
8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 Tension Test: 
8.1.1 Requirements-Transverse tensile properties of the 
welded joint shall meet the minimum requirements for ultimate 
tensile strength of the specified plate material. In addition for 
Grades Dxx, Hxx, Jxx, and Nxx in Classes 3x, 4x, and 5x 
transverse tensile properties of the base plate, shall be deter­
mined on specimens cut from the heat-treated pipe. These 
properties shall meet the mechanical test requirements of the 
plate specification. 
8.1.2 Number of Tests-One test specimen shall be made to 
represent each lot of finished pipe. 
8.1.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation-The test 
specimens shall be taken transverse to the weld at the end of 
the finished pipe and may be flattened cold before final 
machining to size. 
8.1.4 Test Method-The test specimen shall be made in 
accordance with QW-150 in Section IX of the ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code. The test specimen shall be tested at 
room temperature in accordance with Test Methods and Defi­
nitions A370. 
8.2 Transverse-Guided-Weld-Bend Tests: 
8 .2.1 Requirements-The bend test shall be acceptable if no 
cracks or other defects exceeding 1/s in. [3 mm] in any direction 
are present in the weld metal or between the weld and the base 
metal after bending. Cracks that originate along the edges of 
the specimen during testing, and that are less than 
¼ in. [6 mm] measured in any direction shall not be consid­
ered. 
8.2.2 Number of Tests-One test (two specimens) shall be 
made to represent each lot of finished pipe. 
8.2.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation-Two bend 
test specimens shall be taken transverse to the weld at the end 
of the finished pipe. As an alternative by agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer, the test specimens may be 
taken from a test plate of the same material as the pipe, the test 
plate being attached to the end of the cylinder and welded as a 
prolongation of the pipe longitudinal seam. 
8.2.4 Test Method-The test requirements of Test Methods 
and Definitions A370, paragraph A2.5.l.7 shall be met. For 
wall thickness over 3/s in. [10 mm] but less than¾ in. [19 mm] 
side-bend tests may be made instead of the face and root-bend 
tests. For wall thicknesses ¾ in. [19 mm] and over both 
specimens shall be subjected to the side-bend test. 
8.3 Pressure Test-Classes X2 and X3 pipe shall be tested in 
accordance with Specification A530/A530M, Hydrostatic Test 
Requirements. 
9. Radiographic Examination 
9 .1 The full length of each weld of Classes X 1 and X2 shall 
be radiographically examined in accordance with and meet the 
requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
Section VIII, paragraph UW-51. 
9.2 Radiographic examination may be performed prior to 
heat treatment. 
10. Rework 
10.1 Elimination of Suiface Impeifections-Unacceptable 
surface imperfections shall be removed by grinding or machin­
ing. The remaining thickness of the section shall be no less than
