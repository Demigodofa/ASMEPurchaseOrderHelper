3. General Conditions for Delivery 
3.1 Except for investment castings and centrifugally cast 
pipe, castings furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A703/A703M, including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase 
order. Failure to comply with the general requirements of 
Specification A703/A703M constitutes nonconformance with 
this specification. In case of conflict between the requirements 
of this specification and Specification A703/A703M, this 
specification shall prevail. 
3.2 Investment castings furnished to this specification shall 
conform to the requirements of Specification A985/A985M, 
including any supplementary requirements that are indicated in 
the purchase order. Failure to comply with the general require­
ments of Specification A985/A985M constitutes nonconfor­
mance with this specification. In case of conflict between the 
requirements of this specification and Specification A985/ 
A985M, Specification A985/ A985M shall prevail. 
3.3 Centrifugally cast pipe furnished under this specification 
shall conform to the requirements of Specification A999/ 
A999M, including any supplementary requirements that are 
indicated in the purchase order. Failure to comply with the 
general requirements of Specification A999/A999M consti­
tutes nonconformance with this specification. In case of con­
flict between the requirements of this specification and Speci­
fication A999/A999M, this specification shall prevail. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 Orders for material under this specification shall include 
the following, as required, to describe the desired material 
adequately:

4.1.1.1 A description of the casting by pattern number or 
drawing ( dimensional tolerances shall be included on the 
casting drawing), 
4.1.1.2 Grade and class of steel, 
4.1.1.3 Options in the specification (see 5.1.5, 5.2, 7.1.4, 
8.4, 10.3.5, and 10.3.7, 10.3.8.2, and 10.3.8.3), 
4.1.1.4 Whether the castings are to be produced using the 
investment casting process, and 
4.1.1.5 The supplementary requirements desired including 
the standards of acceptance.

4.1.2.8 Whether the castings are to be used in ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code Sections I, ID, IV, vm, and XII 
construction; or in ASME Codes B16.34, B31.l, B31.3, or 
other ASME construction codes, and 
4.1.2.9 The supplementary requirements desired. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Heat Treatment-Grades shall be furnished in the aus­
tenitized and tempered condition. Before heat treatment, cast­
ings shall be allowed to cool to a temperature below the 
transformation. range. 
5 .1.1 Grade C91 shall be heat treated by heating to a 
temperature range of 1900 to 1975 °F [1040 to 1080 °C] and 
either air cooled or accelerated cooled from the austenitizing 
temperature by air blasting or liquid quenching, to a tempera­
ture of 200 °F [95 °C] or below, followed by tempering at 1350 
to 1470 °F [730 to 800 °C]. 
5.1.2 Grade C933 shall be heat treated by heating to a 
temperature range of 2010 to 2190 °F [1100 to 1200 °C] and 
either air cooled or accelerated cooled from the austenitizing 
temperature by air blasting or liquid quenching to a tempera­
ture of 200 °F [95 °C] or below, followed by tempering at 1350 
to 1440 °F [730 to 780 °C]. 
5.1.3 Compliance with the temperature ranges specified in 
5.1.1 and 5.1.2 for castings heat treated singly shall be verified 
by a thermocouple or thermocouples placed directly on the 
castings. 
5.1.4 Compliance with the temperature ranges specified in 
5.1.1 and 5.1.2 for castings heat treated in batches shall be 
verified by thermocouples placed on selected castings in each 
batch. 
5.1.5 Unless specified by the purchaser, the number and 
locations of thermocouples to be placed on each casting, or on 
castings in each heat-treatment batch, shall be at the discretion 
of the producer. 
5.1.6 A record of the final austenitizing and tempering heat 
treatment and, if specified in the order (see 10.3.7) of any and 
all subsequent subcritical heat treatments, shall be made and 
shall be shown on the material test report. The record shall 
include both the number and locations of thermocouples 
applied to each casting, or to each heat-treatment batch of 
castings. 
5.2 Machining-Centrifugally cast pipe shall be machined 
on the inner and outer surfaces to a roughness value no greater 
than 250 µin. [6.35 µm] arithmetical average deviation (AA) 
from the mean line unless otherwise specified as in ANSI 
B46.l.
