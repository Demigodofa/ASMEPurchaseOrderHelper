3.2.1.5 Any requirements additional to the provi­
sions of this practice. 
3.3 Procedure B: Back-Wall Reflection Calibration 
Procedure - When this procedure is to be applied to an 
inquiry, contract, or order, the purchaser shall designate the 
quality levels for the entire casting or applicable portions. 
PROCEDURE A - FLAT-BOTTOMED HOLE 
CALIBRATION PROCEDURE 
4. Apparatus 
4.1 Electronic Apparatus: 
4.1.1 An ultrasonic, pulsed, reflection type of instru­
ment that is capable of generating, receiving, and ampli­
fying frequencies of at least 1 to 5 MHz. 
4.1.2 The ultrasonic instrument shall provide linear 
presentation (within ±5%) for at least 75% of the screen 
height (sweep line to top of screen). Linearity shall be 
determined in accordance with Practice E 317 or equivalent 
electronic means. 
4.1.3 The electronic apparatus shall contain a signal 
attenuator or calibrated gain control that shall be accurate 
over its useful range to ±10% of the nominal attenuation 
or gain ratio to allow measurement of signals beyond the 
linear range of the instrument. 
4.2 Search Units: 
4.2.1 Longitudinal Wave, internally grounded, having 
a ½ to 1½ in. [13 to 28 mm] diameter or 1 in. [25 mm] 
square piezo-electric elements. Based on the signals-to­
noise ratio of the response pattern of the casting, a fre­
quency in the range from 1 to 5 MHz shall be used. The 
background noise shall not exceed 25% of the distance 
amplitude correction curve (DAC). Transducers shall be 
utilized at their rated frequencies. 
4.2.2 Dual-Element, 5 MHz, ½, by 1 in. [13 by 
25 mm], 12° included angle search units are recommended 
for sections 1 in. [25 mm] and under. 
4.2.3 Other frequencies and sizes of search units may 
be used for evaluating and pinpointing indications. 
4.3 Reference Blocks: 
4.3.1 Reference blocks containing flat-bottom holes 
shall be used to establish test sensitivity in accordance 
with 8.2. 
4.3.2 Reference blocks shall be made from cast steels 
that give an acoustic response similar to the castings being 
examined. 
4.3.3 The design of reference blocks shall be in 
accordance with Fig. 1, and the basic set shall consist of 
those blocks listed in Table 1. When section thicknesses 
over 15 in. [380 mm] are to be inspected, an additional 
block of the maximum test thickness shall be made to 
supplement the basic set. 
4.3.4 Machined blocks with ¾ 2 in. [2.4 mm] diameter 
flat-bottom holes at depths from the entry surface of ½ in. 
[3 mm], ½ in. [13 mm], or ½t and ¾ in. [19 mm], or ¾t 
( where t = thickness of the block) shall be used to establish 
the DAC for the dual-element search units (see Fig. 2). 
4.3.5 Each reference block shall be permanently 
identified along the side of the block indicating the material 
and the block identification. 
4.4 Couplant - A suitable couplant having good wet­
ting characteristics shall be used between the search unit 
and examination surface. The same couplant shall be used 
for calibrations and examinations. 
5. Personnel Requirements 
5.1 The manufacturer shall be responsible for assigning 
qualified personnel to perform ultrasonic examination in 
conformance with the requirements of this practice. 
5.2 Personnel performing ultrasonic examinations in 
accordance with this practice shall be familiar with the 
following: 
5.2.1 Ultrasonic terminology. 
5.2.2 Instrument calibration. 
5.2.3 Effect of transducer material, size, frequency, 
and mode on test results. 
5.2.4 Effect of material structure (grain size, cleanli-
ness, etc.) on test results. 
5.2.5 Effect of test distance on test results. 
5.2.6 Effect of nonlinearity on test results. 
5.2.7 Effect of thickness and orientation of disconti­
nuities on test results. 
5.2.8 Effect of surface roughness on test results. 
5.3 A qualification record (see Note 2) of personnel 
considered suitable by the manufacturer to perform exami­
nations in accordance with this practice shall be available • 
upon request. 
NOTE 2 - SNT-TC-lA, Ultrasonic Testing Method, provides a recom­
mended procedure for qualifying personnel. Other personnel qualification 
requirement documents may be used when agreed upon between the 
purchaser and the supplier. 
6. Casting Conditions 
6.1 Castings shall receive at least an austenitizing heat 
treatment before being ultrasonically examined. 
6.2 Test surfaces of castings shall be free of material 
that will interfere with the ultrasonic examination. They 
may be as cast, blasted, ground, or machined.
