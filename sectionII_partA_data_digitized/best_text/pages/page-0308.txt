SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall be applied only when specified by 
the purchaser in the inquiry, contract, or order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be 
agreed upon in writing by the manufacturer and purchaser. Supplementary requirements shall in no 
way negate any requirement of the specification itself. 
Sl. Strain-Hardened Austenitic Steel Nuts 
Sl.1 Strain hardened Grades 8, SC, ST, SM, SF, SP, SN, or 
8MN nuts may be specified. When Supplementary Require­
ment S 1 is invoked in the order, nuts shall be machined from 
cold drawn bars or shall be cold forged to shape. No subse­
quent heat treatment shallbe performed on the nuts. Nuts made 
256 
in accordance with this requirement shall be proof load tested 
in accordance with 8.2.2.1 and shall withstand the proof load 
specified in Table S 1.1 and Table S 1.2. Testing nuts requiring 
proof loads over 160 000 lbf or 705 kN is only required when 
Supplementary Requirement S4 is invoked. The hardness 
limits of Table 2 do not apply to strain hardened nuts. Nuts
