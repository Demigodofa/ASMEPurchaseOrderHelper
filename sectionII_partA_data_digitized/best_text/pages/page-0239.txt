4. Ordering Information 
4.1 Orders for material under this specification should 
include the following, as required, to describe the desired 
material adequately: 
4.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
4.1.2 Name of product (electric-resistance-welded pipe), 
4.1.3 Specification designation and year of issue, 
4.1.4 Grade (see Table 1), 
4.1.5 Size (nominal size, NPS [DN], or outside diameter; 
and nominal wall thickness), 
4.1.6 Length (specific or random, see 12.4), 
4.1.7 End finish (plain or threaded, see 13.2), 
4.1.7.1 Threaded and coupled, if specified, 
4.1.7.2 Threads only, if specified, 
4.1.7.3 Plain end, if specified, 
4.1.8 Alternative electric test (see Section 11), 
4.1.9 Tension test specimen (see Section 15), 
4.1.10 Heat analysis, if required (see 6.1), 
4.1.11 Certificate of compliance, if required (see Section 
19), and 
4.1.12 Special requirements. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 The steel shall be made by either or both of the 
following processes: basic-oxygen or electric-furnace. 
5.2 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When 
steels of different grades are sequentially strand cast, identifi­
cation of the resultant transition material is required. The 
producer shall remove the transition material by any estab­
lished procedure that positively separates the grades. 
5.3 The pipe shall be manufactured from flat rolled steel in 
individual lengths or in continuous length by electric-resistance 
or electric-induction welding without the addition of extrane­
ous material. 
187 
5.4 The weld seam of electric-resistance welded pipe to 
Grade B pipe shall be heat treated after welding to a minimum 
temperature of 1000 °F [540 °C] or processed in such a manner 
that no untempered martensite remains. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements prescribed 
in Table 2, based on the heat analysis. When specified in the 
Element 
Carbon 
Manganese 
Phosphorus 
Sulfur
