TABLE 4 Thickness Tolerances for Hot-Rolled Sheet (Carbon and Structural Steel Only)-5/s-in. (Cut Edge) and 1-in. (Mill Edge) 
Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut Lengths, Including Pickled) 
NoTE 1-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than 5 /s in. from a cut edge and not less than 1 in. from a mill edge. This table 
does not apply to the uncropped ends of mill edge coils. 
NoTE 2--.:Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in. 
(4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or ronnded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm]. 
Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements. 
NoTE 3-The thickness of material <2 in. wide shall be measured at mid-width.

NoTE 2-Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in.

Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements.

A The specified thickness range captions apply independent of whether the ordered thickness is stated as a nominal or minimum. 
8 The tolerances provided in the table are based on minimum thickness (tolerance over, no tolerance under). For nominal thickness, the tolerance is divided equally over 
and under. 
c Where an ellipsis ( ... ) appears in the table, the requirements have not been defined. 
The luster may not be retained after fabrication; therefore, the 
formed parts will require surface preparation to make them 
suitable for bright plating. 
9.3 Cold-rolled carbon sheet, when intended for unexposed 
applications, is not subject to limitations on degree and 
frequency of surface imperfections, and restrictions on texture 
and mechanical properties are not applicable. When ordered as 
"annealed last," the product will have coil breaks and a 
tendency toward fluting and stretcher straining. Unexposed 
cold-rolled sheet may contain more surface imperfections than 
exposed cold-rolled sheet because steel applications, process­
ing procedures, and inspection standards are less stringent. 
9.4 Cold-rolled high-strength low-alloy sheet is supplied 
with a matte finish, unless otherwise specified. 
9.5 The cold-rolled products covered by this specification 
are furnished with cut edges and square cut ends, unless 
otherwise specified.
