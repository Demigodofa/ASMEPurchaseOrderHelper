NOTE 1 - A typical ordering description is as follows: 10000 lb carbon 
steel bars, cold drawn, stress relieved turned and polished, ronnd 2.0 in. 
(50.8 mm) Diameter, 10 to 12 ft (3048 to 3658 mm) long, Class B, . 
Grade 1050, (UNS Gl0500), fine grain, test reports required, ASTM 
A 311/A 311M dated __ , hyclraulic cylinder piston rods. [5000 kg 
carbon steel bars, cold clrawn, stress relieved turned and polished round 
50 mm diameter, 3050 to 3650 mm long, Class B, Grade 1050 (UNS 
G 10500), fine grain, test reports required, ASTM A 31 lM dated __ , 
hyc\raulic cylinder piston rods.] 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 Melting Practice - The steel shall be made by one 
or more of the following primary processes: open-hearth, 
basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace. The primary melting 
may incorporate separate degassing or refining and may 
be followed by secondary melting using electroslag remelt­
ing or vacuum arc remelting. Where secondary melting is 
employed, the heat shall be defined as all of the ingots 
remelted from a single primary heat. 
6.2 Cold Working: 
6.2.1 Class A bars shall be cold drawn using normal 
drafting practices. 
6.2.2 Class B bars shall be cold drawn using heavy 
(higher than normal) drafting practices. 
6.3 Thermal Treatment - After cold drawing, the bars 
shall be stress relieved at a temperature of not less than 
550°F [288°C] to meet the mechanical requirements speci­
fied in Table 2. 
6.4 Condition - The bars shall be furnished in the 
following cold finish conditions, as specified: 
6.4.1 Cold drawn, stress relieved; 
6.4.2 Cold drawn, stress relieved, turned, and pol­
ished; 
6.4.3 Cold drawn, stress relieved, turned, ground, 
and polished; and 
6.4.4 Cold drawn, stress relieved, ground, and pol­
ished. 
NOTE 2 - When turned bars are specified, turning may be perfonned 
prior to cold-drawing. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 Composition -The cast or heat analysis shall con­
form to the chemical composition requirements specified 
in Table 1 for the grade ordered. 
8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 Requirements - The bars shall conform to the 
requirements listed in Table 2. 
8.2 Number of Tests - At least one tension test shall 
be made on each lot. A lot shall consist of bars of the same 
size from the same heat which have been stress relieved 
in the same stationary furnace charge. For continuous type 
of treatment, a lot shall consist of 25 tons [25 Mg] or less 
of the same size of each heat, treated in the same cycle. 
8.3 Specimens - Tension test specimens shall be taken 
longitudinally in accordance with and from the locations 
specified in Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
8.4 Test Methods - Tension tests shall be made in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. The 
yield strength shall be determined at 0.2% offset or at 
0.005 in.Jin. [0.005 mm/mm] of gage length, total extension 
under load. 
9. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
9.1 Suiface Finish - Unless otherwise specified, the 
bars shall have a commercial bright smooth surface finish 
consistent with the cold finishing operations specified in 
6.4. 
9.2 Bars that are thermal treated after cold finishing 
may have a discolored or oxidized surface. 
9.3 Oiling - The bars shall be given a surface coating 
of oil or other rust inhibitor to protect against rust during 
shipment.
