Description 
Single grade: No classes in CR grades 
Multiple grades, meet chemical and 
mechanical properties of each 
Single Grade: seamless 
Single Grade; welded: RT or UT pipe 
welds with filler metal and all fitting 
manufacturer's welds 
Single grade: welded: RT all welds with 
or without filler metal 
Single grade; welded: UT all welds with 
or without filler metal 
Multiple grades: meet chemical and 
mechanical properties of each: 
seamless 
thicknesses thinner than 0.083 in. [2.1 mm], no metal impres­
sion stamps shall be used. Vibrating pencil marking is accept­
able. 
15.1.3 Threaded or socket-welding fittings shall be addi­
tionally marked with the pressure class. Plugs and bushings 
furnished to ASME B 16.11 reqnirements are not required to be 
marked. The class S marking need not be added to the material 
grade for threaded or socket-welded fittings. 
15.1.4 When agreed upon between the purchaser and 
producer, and specified in the order, the markings shall be 
painted or stenciled on the fitting or stamped on a metal or 
plastic tag which shall be securely attached to the fitting. 
15.1.5 Fittings meeting the chemical and mechanical prop­
erty requirements of Table 2 and Table 5 for more than one 
grade designation may be marked with more than one class or 
grade designation, such as WP304/304H; WP304/304L; 
WP304/304L/304N, WP316/316L, etc. 
15.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 15.1, 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. The bar coding system, if applied at 
the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one of 
the published industry standards for bar coding. If used on 
small fittings, the bar code may be applied to the box or a 
substantially applied tag.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the supplementary requirements described below or appearing in Specification 
A960/ A960M may be included in the order or contract. When so included, a supplementary 
requirement shall have the same force as if it were in the body of the specification. Supplementary 
requirement details not fully described shall be agreed upon between the purchaser and the supplier. 
Sl. Special Filler Metal 
Sl.l Filler metal shall be AWS Type E16-8-2 or ER 16-8-2 
(AWS Specifications A 5.4 and A 5.9, respectively). Fittings 
welded with 16-8-2 weld metal shall be marked WP_ HRW 
or CR _ HRW, as appropriate. 
S2. Stabilizing Treatment 
S2.1 Subsequent to the solution anneal required by 6.2, 
Grades 321, 321H, 347, 347H, 348, and 348H shall be given a 
stabilizing treatment at 1500 to 1600 °F [815 to 870 °C] for a 
minimum of 2 h/in. [4.7 min/mm] of thickness and then 
cooling in the furnace or in air. In addition to the marking 
682 
required in Section 15, the grade designation symbol shall be 
followed by the symbol "S2." 
S3. ASME Section III Construction 
S3.l Products welded with filler metal furnished under this 
specification that are intended for application under the rules of 
Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code shall 
be manufactured by holders of the appropriate ASME Certifi­
cate of Authorization and Certification Mark. The product is 
subject to all applicable requirements of Section III, including 
welding, heat treatment, nondestructive examination, autho­
rized inspection at the point of manufacture, and application of 
the Certification Mark.
