to ensure that the parts are within the hardness limits given for 
each grade in Table 3. When only one part is produced, it shall 
be hardness tested as required. The purchaser is permitted to 
verify that the requirement has been met by testing at any 
location on any part provided such testing does not render the 
part useless. 
9.6.2 When the reduced number of tension tests permitted 
by 9.5.1 is applied, additional hardness tests shall be made on 
parts or samples as defined in 9.2 distributed throughout the 
charge. At least eight samples shall be checked from each batch 
load and a least one check/h shall be made from a continuous 
run. When the furnace charge is less than eight parts, each part 
shall be checked. If any hardness test result falls outside the 
prescribed limits, the entire lot of parts shall be reheat treated 
and the requirements of 9.5.1 shall apply. 
9.7 Fatigue Tests-When specified in the order, the fatigue 
strength of austenitic stainless steel components intended for 
service above 1000 °F [540 °C] shall be determined in 
accordance with Section S18. 
10. Corrosion Testing 
10.1 Corrosion testing is not required by this specification. 
10.2 Austenitic stainless steels shall be capable of meeting 
the intergranular c01rnsion test requirements described in 
Section Sll. 
10.3 When required by the purchaser, the stainless steels 
shall be tested in the final heat treated condition for pitting or 
crevice corrosion resistance according to the procedures de­
scribed in Section S12. 
10.4 Austenitic-ferritic stainless steels shall be capable of 
meeting the test requirements described in Section S13. 
11. Product Analysis 
11.1 The purchaser is permitted to make a product analysis 
on parts supplied to this specification. Samples for analysis 
shall be taken from midway between the center and surface of 
solid parts, midway between the inner and outer surfaces of 
hollow parts, midway between the center and surface of 
full-size prolongations, or from broken mechanical test speci­
mens. The chemical composition thus determined shall con­
form to Table 1 with the tolerances as stated in Table 4. 
12. Reheat Treatment 
12.1 If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform to 
the requirements specified, the manufacturer is permitted to 
reheat treat the paits and repeat the tests specified in Section 9, 
but not more than twice. 
13. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion 
Protection 
13.1 The requirements of Specification A961/A961M apply 
to hot isostatically pressed finished parts. 
13.2 In addition to the requirements of Specification A961/ 
A961M, the following requirements apply: 
13.2.1 The parts shall be free of machining burrs, and 
machined surfaces, other than surfaces having special
