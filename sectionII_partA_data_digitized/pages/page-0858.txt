SA-453 /SA-453M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
High-Temperature Bolting, with Expansion Coefficients 
Comparable to Austenitic Stainless Steels 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers five grades of bolting mate­
rials with twelve classes of yield strength ranging from 50 to 
120 ksi [345 to 827 MPa] for use in high-temperature service 
for bolting components, such as bolts, screws, nuts, or studs, 
for pressure vessel and valve flanges. See Specification A962/ 
A962M for the definition of bolting. The material requires 
special processing and is not intended for general purpose 
applications. 
1.2 The following referenced general requirements are in­
dispensable for application of this specification: Specification 
A962/A962M. 
1.3 Supplementary Requirements are provided for use at the 
option of the purchaser. The Supplementary Requirements 
shall only apply when specified individually by the purchaser 
in the purchase order or contract. 
1 .4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units; however, unless the purchase order or contract 
specifies the applicable "M" specification designation (SI 
units), the inch-pound units shall apply. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
I.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
