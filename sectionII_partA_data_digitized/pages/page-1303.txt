CAMBER TOLERANCESA OF HOT-ROLLED STRIP 
(CARBON AND HIGH-STRENGTH LOW-ALLOY) (COILS 
AND CUT LENGTHS, INCLUDING PICKLED, 
APPLICABLE TO MILL EDGE, SQUARE EDGE, AND 
SLIT OR CUT EDGE) 
For strip wider than 50 mm - 5.0 mm in any 2000 mm 
For strip 50 mm and narrower - 10.0 mm in any 2000 mm 
NOTE 1 - Camber is the deviation of a side edge from a straight line. 
The standa1·d for measuring this deviation is based on any 2000 mm 
length. 8 It is obtained by placing a 2000 mm straightedge on the concave 
side and measuring the maximum distance between the strip edge and 
the straightedge. 
A When the camber tolerances shown in the above table are not 
suitable for a particular purpose, hot-rolled strip is sometimes 
machine straightened. 
8 For strip less than 2000 mm tolerances are to be established in 
each instance.

FLATNESS TOLERANCES OF HOT-ROLLED STRIP 
(CARBON AND HIGH-STRENGTH LOW-ALLOY) 
It has not been practicable to formulate flatness tolerances 
for hot-rolled strip because of the wide range of widths 
and thicknesses, and variety of chemical compositions and 
qualities, produced in coi Is and cut lengths.
