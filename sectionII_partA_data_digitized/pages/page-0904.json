PERMITTED VARIATIONS IN DIMENSIONS-SI UNITS \nA3.1 Listed in Annex A3 are tables showing the permitted \nvariations in dimensions expressed in SI units of measurement. \nThese requirements shall apply to A480M but shall not apply \nto A480. Requirements for A480 are given in Annex A2. \nA3.1.1 The dimensional tolerances are grouped by produc\u00ad\ntion method (hot rolling or cold rolling, with or without \ncoiling), product width (narrow ( <600 mm) or wide \n(2:600 mm)), and by product dimension addressed. \nA3.2 Cold-rolled Narrow ( <600 mm Width) Coil-processed \nProduct-For thickness, width, length, and flatness \ntolerance tables, refer to Tables A3.l-A3.4. \nA3.3 Cold-rolled Wide (2:600 mm Width) Coil-processed \nProduct-For thickness, width, length, and flatness \ntolerance tables, refer to Tables A3.5-A3.8. \nA3.4 Hot-rolled Narrow ( <600 mm Width) Coil-processed \nProduct-For thickness, width, length, and flatness \ntolerance tables, refer to Tables A3.9-A3.12. \nA3.5 Hot-rolled Wide (2:600 mm Width) Coil-processed \nProduct-For thickness, width, length, and flatness \ntolerance tables, refer to Tables A3.13-A3.1~. \nA3.6 Hot-rolled Product Processed Without Coiling-For \nthickness, width, length, and .flatness tolerance tables, refer to \nTables A3.17-A3.20. \nA3.7 Cold-rolled Product Processed Without Coiling-For \nthickness, width, length, and flatness tolerance tables, refer to \nTable A3.21. \nA3.8 Tolerances for Other Dimensional Characteristics\u00ad\nFor other tolerance tables, refer to Tables A3.22-A3.30. \nTABLE A3.1 Permitted Variations in Thickness of Cold-rolled, \nNarrow, Coil-processed Product as Coll and Cut Lengths \nNorn I-Thickness measurements are taken at least 10 mm in from the \nedge of the product, except that on widths less than 26 mm, the tolerances \nare applicable for measurements at all locations. \nNorn 2-The tolerances in this table include crown tolerances. \nNOTE 3-For specified thicknesses other than those shown, the toler\u00ad\nances for the next higher thickness shall apply. \nThickness Tolerances, for the Thickness and Widths Given, \nSpecified Over and Under, mm \nThickness, -==-,........,.==-.,---,--=---W...,.l==dt'\"\"h~(w-=-)~, ,...m.,..m--:--=----===-.,.......,==---,-50 to 150, Incl over 150 to 300, incl Over 300 to 600, excl \nmm ws 125 125 < ws 250 250 < w < 600 \n0.15 \n0.25 \n0.50 \n0.75 \n1.00 \n1.25 \n1.50 \n1.75 \n2.00 \n2.50 \n3.00 \n4.00 \n4.99 \n0.010 \n0.o15 \n0.025 \n0.030 \n0.030 \n0.035 \n0.040 \n0.050 \n0.050 \n0.050 \n0.060 \n0.070 \n0.070 \nThickness TolerancesA \n0.o15 \n0.020 \n0.030 \n0.040 \n0.040 \n0.045 \n0.050 \n0.060 \n0.060 \n0.070 \n0.070 \n0.070 \n0.070 \nA Thickness tolerances given in mm unless otherwise indicated. \n804 \n0.020 \n0.025 \n0.035 \n0.050 \n0.050 \n0.050 \n0.060 \n0.070 \n0.070 \n0.080 \n0.090 \n0.090 \n0.090 ",
