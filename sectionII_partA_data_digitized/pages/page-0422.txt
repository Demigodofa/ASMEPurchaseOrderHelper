continuous furnace, the number of tubes of the same size and 
from the same heat in a lot shall be detem1ined from the size 
of the tubes given in Table 5. 
8.2 For tensile and hardness test requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same specified 
outside diameter and specified wall thickness that are produced 
from the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a 
batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the 
same size and the same heat that are heat treated in the same 
furnace charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous 
furnace, a lot shall include all tubes of the same size and heat, 
heat treated in the same furnace at the same temperature, time 
at heat, and furnace speed. 
9. Forming Operations 
9.1 Tubes when inserted in the boiler shall stand expanding 
and beading without showing cracks or flaws. Superheater 
tubes when properly manipulated shall stand all forging, 
welding, and bending operations necessary for application 
without developing defects.
