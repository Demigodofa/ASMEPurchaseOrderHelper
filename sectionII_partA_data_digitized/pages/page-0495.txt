A Inspect all bolts in the lot if the lot size is less than the sample size. 
individual shipments of material are not ordinarily contem­
plated. Individual heats of steel are not identified in the finished 
product. 
8.2 When specified in the order, the manufacturer shall 
furnish a test report certified to be the last completed set of 
mechanical tests for each stock size in each shipment. 
8.3 When additional tests are specified on the purchase 
order, a lot, for purposes of selecting test samples, shall consist 
of all material offered for inspection at one time that has the 
following common characteristics: 
8.3.1 One type of item, 
8.3.2 One nominal size, and 
8.3.3 One nominal length of bolts and studs. 
8.4 From each lot, the number of tests for each requirement 
shall be as follows: 
Number of Pieces in Lot Number of Samples 
800 and under 1 
801 to 8 000 2 
8 001 to 22 ooo 3 
Over 22 000 5 
8.5 If any machined test specimen shows defective machin­
ing it shall be discarded and another specimen substituted. 
8.6 Should any sample fail to meet the requirements of a 
specified test, double the number of samples from the same lot 
shall be tested, in which case all of the additional samples shall 
meet the specification. 
9. Test Methods 
9.1 Grades A and B bolts and studs shall be tested in 
accordance with Test Methods F606. 
9.2 Standard square and hex head bolts only shall be tested 
by the wedge tension method except as noted in 6.4. Fracture 
shall be in the body or threads of the bolt without any fracture 
at the junction of the head and body. Other headed bolts shall 
be tested by the axial tension method. 
9.3 Speed of testing as detennined with a free running 
crosshead shall be a maximum of 1 in./min for the tensile 
strength tests of bolts. 
10. Inspection 
10.1 If the inspection described in 10.2 is required by the 
purchaser it shall be specified in the inquiry, order, or contract. 
10.2 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have

that the material is being furnished in accordance with this 
specification. All tests and inspections required by the specifi­
cation that are requested by the purchaser's representative shall 
be made before shipment, and shall be conducted as not to 
interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the works. 
11. Responsibility 
11.1 The party responsible for the fastener shall be the 
organization that supplies the fastener to the purchaser.

a unique identifier by the manufacturer to identify the manu­
facturer. Additional marking required by the manufacturer for 
his own use shall be at the option of the manufacturer. 
13.1.2 In addition to the requirements of 13.1, all bolt heads, 
one end of studs ¾ in. and larger, and whenever feasible studs 
less th.an 1/s in. shall be marked with a grade marking as 
follows: 
Grade 
A 
B 
Marking 
307A 
307B

14.2.1.1 ASTM designation and grade, 
14.2.1.2 Size, 
14.2.1.3 Name and brand or trademark of the manufacturer, 
14.2.1.4 Number of pieces, 
14.2.1.5 Purchase order number, 
14.2.1.6 Country of origin.
