Scope \nl. 1 This specification covers gray iron for castings suitable \nfor pressure-containing parts for use at temperatures up to \n650\u00b0F (350\u00b0C). \n1.2 Classes of Iron: \n1.2.1 Castings of all classes are suitable for use up to 450\u00b0F \n(230\u00b0C). For temperatures above 450\u00b0F and up to 650\u00b0F, only \nClass 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 castings are suitable. \n1.2.2 Castings of all classes are suitable for use up to 230\u00b0C. \nFor temperatures above 230\u00b0C and up to 350\u00b0C, only Class \n275, 300, 325, 350, 380, and 415 castings are suitable. \n1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may tesult in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA644 Terminology Relating to Iron Castings \nE8 Test Methods for Tension Testing of Metallic Materials \n3, Terminology \n3 .1 Definitions of many terms common to gray iron castings \nmay be found in Tem1inology A644. \n4. Classification \n4.1 Classification by tensile strength. \n418 \n4.1.1 Castings ordered to this specification are classified \nbased upon the minimum tensile strength of the iron in ksi, in \nEnglish units. Class 25 has a minimum specified tensile \nstrength of 25 ksi. \n4.1.2 Castings ordered to this specification are classified \nbased upon the minimum tensile strength of the iron in MPa, in \nMetric units. Class 150 has a minimum specified tensile \nstrength of 150 MPa. \n5. Ordering Information \n5.1 Orders for material in this specification should include \nthe following information: \n5.1.1 ASTM designation and year date, \n5.1.2 Class of iron required and service temperature, \n5. I.3 Quantity, \n5.1.4 Heat Treatment: \n5.1.4.1 Whether or not heat treatment is required for Class \n40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 castings to be used at temperatures at \n450\u00b0F or less (see 6.2), \n5.1.4.2 Whether or not heat treatment is required for Class \n275, 300, 325, 350, 380, and 415 castings to be used at \ntemperatures at 230\u00b0C or less (see 6.2), \n5.1.5 The size of separately cast test bar to be poured (see \nSection 9 and Table 1), \n5.1.6 The size of test specimen to be machined from test \nbars C or S, and \n5 .1. 7 Special requirements. \n6. Materials and Manufacture \n6.1 Castings intended for use above 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C) shall be \nstress-relieved by placing them in a suitable furnace at a \ntemperature not exceeding 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) and heating them \nuniformly to the temperatures and for the times specified in \nTable 2. The heating and cooling rates shall be uniform and \nshall not be more than 400\u00b0F/h (250\u00b0C/h) for castings of 1-in. \n(25-mm) maximum section. For heavier sections the maximum \nheating and cooling rates in degrees Fahrenheit per hour shall \nbe 400 divided by the maximum section thickness. \n6.2 Heat Treatment and Cooling Rate: \n6.2. l Castings of Class Nos. 45, 50, 55, and 60, which axe to \nbe used at temperatures below 450\u00b0F, may be heat treated in ",
