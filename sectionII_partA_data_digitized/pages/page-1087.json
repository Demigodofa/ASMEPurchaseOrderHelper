Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut Lengths) \nNoTE I-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than 1 in. from a side edge. \nNoTE 2-Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in. \n[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in.
