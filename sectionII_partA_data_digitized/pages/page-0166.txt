TABLE A1.7 Permissible Variations in Dimensions for Half-
Rounds, Ovals, Half-Ovals, and Other Special Bar Size Sections 
Due to mill facilities, tolerances on half-rounds, ovals, half-ovals, and 
other special bar size sections vary among the manufacturers and 
such tolerances should be negotiated between the manufacturer and 
the purchaser.
