ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-574 
4.2.8 For establishment of a part identifying system, 
see ASME B 18.24 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 The screws shall be fabricated from a steel which 
has been made by the open-hearth, basic-oxygen, or elec­
tric-furnace process. 
5.2 The screws shall be fabricated from alloy steel 
made to a fine grain practice. In the event of controversy 
over grain size, referee tests on finished screws conducted 
in accordance with Test Methods E 112 shall prevail. 
5.3 Unless otherwise specified, the heads of screws 
through 1.500 in. diameter shall be fabricated by hot or 
cold forging. Over 1.500 in. diameter, the heads may be 
fabricated by hot or cold forging or by machining. Sockets 
may be forged or machined. 
5.4 Unless otherwise specified, threads of screws shall 
be rolled for diameters through 0.625 in. and for screw 
lengths through 4 in. For diameters and lengths other than 
this, threads may be rolled, cut, or ground. 
5.5 The screws shall be heat treated by oil quenching 
from above the transformation temperature and then tem­
pering at a temperature not lower than 650°F. 
5.6 Standard Finishes - Unless otherwise specified, 
the screws shall be furnished with one of the following 
"standard surfaces as manufactured" at the option of the 
manufacturer: ( 1) bright uncoated, (2) thermal black oxide, 
or (3) chemical black oxide. Hydrogen embrittlement tests 
shall not be required for screws furnished in these condi­
tions. 
5.1 Protective Coatings: 
5. 7 .1 When a protective finish other than as specified 
in 5.6 is required, it shall be specified on the purchase 
order with the applicable finish specification. 
5.7.2 When protective or decorative coatings are 
applied to the screws, precautions specified by the coating 
requirements to minimize embrittlement shall be exercised. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The analysis of the screw material shall conform 
to the chemical composition specified in Table S 1.1. 
6.2 Product analyses may be made by the purchaser 
from finished material representing each lot. The chemical 
composition, thus determined, shall conform to the require­
ments prescribed for product analysis in Table S 1.1. 
6.3 DELETED 
6.4 Application of heats of steel to which bismuth, 
selenium, tellurium, or lead has been intentionally added 
shall not be permitted. 
6.5 Chemical analyses shall be performed in accor­
dance with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology 
A 751. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 The hardness of finished screws shall be 39 to 
45 HRC for 0.500 in. and smaller and 37 to 45 HRC for 
0.625 in. and larger. This shall be only the mechanical 
requirements for screws that are shorter than three times 
the diameter or that have insufficient threads for tension 
testing. 
7.2 Screws, other than those exempted in 7.1 and 7.3, 
shall meet the proof load and tensile requirements in Table 
2 and Table 3. The screws shall be tension tested with a 
wedge of the angle specified in Table 4 under the head. 
To meet the requirements of the wedge test, there must be 
a tensile failure in the body or thread section. For the. 
purpose of this test, failure means separation into two 
pieces. Screws threaded to the head shall pass the require­
ments for this test if the fracture that caused failure origi­
nated in the thread area, even though it may have 
propagated into the fillet area or the head before separation. 
7 .3 Screws having a diameter larger than 1.500 in. 
shall be preferably tested in full size and shall meet the 
requirements of Table 2 and Table 3. When equipment of 
sufficient capacity is not readily available, screws shall 
meet 170 ksi, min, tensile strength, 153 ksi, min, yield 
strength at 0.2% offset, and 10% elongation on specimens 
machined in accordance with Test Methods F 606. 
8. Metallurgical Requirement 
8.1 Carburization or Decarburization: 
8.1.1 There shall be no evidence of carburization or 
total decarburization on the surfaces of the heat-treated 
screws when measured in accordance with 12.3. 
8.1.2 The depth of partial decarburization shall be 
limited to the values in Table 5 when measured as shown 
in Fig. 1 and in accordance with 12.3. 
9. Dimensions 
9.1 Unless otherwise specified, the product shall con­
form to the requirements of Bl8.3. 
9.2 Unless otherwise specified, threads shall be Unified 
standard: Class 3A, UNRC and UNRF series for screw 
sizes 0.060 through 1 in. inclusive; Class 2A, UNRC and 
UNRF series for sizes over 1 in. to 1.500 in. inclusive; 
and Class 2A UNRC series for sizes larger than 1.500 in. 
in accordance with B 1. 1.
