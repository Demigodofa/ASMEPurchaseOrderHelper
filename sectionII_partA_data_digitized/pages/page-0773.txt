ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-439 /SA-439M 
cycle, castings may be cooled in still air after the temperature 
has dropped to 600 °F [310 °C]. 
4.4 By agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser, the castings may be in-mold stress relieved by 
allowing castings to cool slowly in the mold at a rate not 
exceeding 400 °FAi [220 °CAi]. Once the temperature has 
dropped below 600 °F [310 °C], castings can be removed from 
the mold and cooled in still air. 
4.5 Whenever dimensional changes in high-temperature 
service are a problem, by agreement between the manufacturer 
and the purchaser, the castings may be stabilized by heating at 
1600 °F [870 °C] for a period of 1 h per inch [25 mm] of 
section, with a minimum period of 1 h, followed by uniform 
cooling, preferably in still air. Otherwise, the austenite, which 
is super saturated with respect to carbon, can reject carbon 
during service and produce dimensional changes. 
4.6 By agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser, castings with chilled edges or excessive carbides 
may be annealed at 1750 to 1900 °F [960 to 1040 °C] for 0.5 h 
to 5 h followed by uniform cooling, preferably in still air. 
4. 7 Repair by welding, plugging, or other methods is not 
permitted. 
5. Magnetic Properties 
5.1 In the event that nonmagnetic castings are specified, the 
magnetic permeability test shall be used. The maximum 
magnetic permeability value shall be agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
Norn 1-A convenient shop test for differentiating the various types of 
austenitic ductile iron is based on the fact that a ground face of either the 
test bar or the castings of Types D-2 and D-2C does not attract a small 
steel horseshoe-type magnet which is normally attracted to steel (Alnico 
magnet should not be used). Types D-3, D-3A, D-5, and D-5B are 
attracted, and types D-2B, D-2S, D-4, and D-5S are slightly attracted. This 
nonmagnetic test is a convenient qualitative test only for Types D-2 and 
D-2C, and shall not be used as a basis for acceptance. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 Many combinations of alloys can be used to obtain an 
austenitic ductile iron. This specification includes ten general 
types defined by the composition limits in Table 1. 
6.2 Samples taken from test coupons, broken test 
specimens, or castings shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. Sampling shall be 
conducted in accordance with Practice E59 and chemical 
analyses in accordance with Test Methods E351 and E30. Test 
Methods E30 should only be used for analyzing those elements 
for which specific coverage is not provided for in Test Methods 
E351. 
6.3 Spectrometric techniques may also be used for analysis, 
but should a dispute arise concerning chemical composition, 
Test Methods E351 and E30 shall be used for referee methods. 
6.4 The chemical analysis for total carbon shall be made on 
either chilled cast pencil-type specimens or thin wafers ap­
proximately v.~2 in. [1.0 mm] thick cut from test coupons. 
Drillings shall not be used because of attendant loss of 
graphite. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7 .1 Test specimens of austenitic ductile iron made according 
to this specification shall meet the test requirements prescribed 
in Table 2. 
7 .2 The yield strength shall be determined in accordance 
with Test Methods E8/E8M, using one of the following 
procedures: the 0.2 % offset method or the extension-under­
load method may be used, by agreement between the purchaser 
and the manufacturer. 
7.3 Brinell hardness shall be determined as HBW 10/3000 
in accordance with Test Method ElO. 
8. Workmanship, Fiuish, and Appearance 
8.1 The castings shall conform substantially to the dimen­
sions on the drawings furnished by the purchaser, or if no 
drawing has been provided, to the dimensions predicated by 
the pattern supplied by the purchaser. The castings shall be free 
of injurious defects. Surfaces of the castings shall be free of 
burnt-on sand and shall be reasonably smooth. Runners, risers, 
fins, and other cast-on pieces shall be removed. In other 
respects, the castings shall conform to whatever points are 
specifically agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
9. Test Bars 
9.1 The standard test bars shall be the 1-in. [25-mm] "Y" 
block and 1-in. [25-mm] keel block as shown in Figs. 1 and 2,
