Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion \nProtection \n11.1 The requirements of Specification A961/A961M apply \nto forgings and finished parts. \n12. Repair by Welding \n12.l Repair of defects by the manufacturer is permissible \nfor forgings made to dimensional standards such as those of \nASME or for other parts made for stock; by the manufacturer. \nPrior approval of the purchaser is required to repair-weld \nspecial forgings made to the purchaser's requirements. \n12.2 Weld repairs shall be made by a process that does not \nproduce undesirably high levels of hydrogen in the welded \nareas. \n12.3 All forgings repaired by welding shall be post-weld \nheat treated between 1100 \u00b0F [593 \u00b0C] and the lower transfor\u00ad\nmation temperature for a minimum of \u00bd h/in. [\u00bd h/25.4 mm] \nof maximum section thickness, or alternatively annealed, \nnormalized and tempered, or quenched and tempered. If the \nforging was not previously heat treated, the original tempering \ntemperature was exceeded, or the forging was fully heat treated \nin the post weld cycle, then the forging shall be tested in \naccordance with Section 8 on completion of the cycle. \n12.4 The mechanical properties of the procedure\u00ad\nqualification weldment shall, when tested in accordance with \nSection IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, \nconform with the requirements listed in Table 2 for the thermal \ncondition of repair-welded forgings. \n13. Rejection and Rehearing \n13.1 Each forging that develops mJunous defects during \nshop working or application shall be rejected and the manu\u00ad\nfacturer notified. \n14. Certification \n14.1 Identification Marking-For forgings made to specified \ndimensions, when agreed upon by the purchaser, and for \nforgings made to dimensional standards, application of identi\u00ad\nfication marks as required in Specification A961/A961M shall \nbe the certification that the forgings have been furnished in \naccordance with the requirements of this specification. \n14.2 Test Reports-The manufacturer shall also provide the \nfollowing, where applicable: \n14.2.1 Type heat treatment, Section 6, \n14.2.2 Tensile property results, Section 8 (Table 2), report \nthe yield strength and tensile strength, in ksi [MPa], elongation \nand reduction in area, in percent; and, if longitudinal strip \ntension specimens are used, report the width of the gauge \nlength, \n14.2.3 Chemical analysis results, Section 7 (Table 1), re\u00ad\nported results shall be to the same number of significant figures \nas the limits specified in Table 1 for that element. \n14.2.4 Hardness results, Section 8 (Table 2), a minimum of \ntwo readings, and \n14.2.5 Any supplementary testing required by the purchase \norder. \n15. Product Marking \n15.1 In addition to marking requirements of Specification \nA961/A961M, the following additional marking requirements \nshall apply: \n15.1.1 If the forgings have been quenched and tempered, the \nletters \"QT\" shall be stamped on the forgings following this \nspecification number. \n15.1.2 Forgings repaired by welding shall be marked with \nthe letter \"W\" following this specification number. \n15.1.3 Plugs and bushings furnished to ASME B16.11 \nrequirements are not required to be marked. Other parts \nordered with no marking are by agreement between the \npurchaser and manufacturer. \n15.1.4 When agreed upon between the purchaser and manu\u00ad\nfacturer and specified in the order, the markings shall be \npainted or stenciled on the fitting or stamped on a metal or \nplastic tag which shall be securely attached to the fitting. \n15.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in \nSpecification A961/A961M, bar coding is acceptable as a \nsupplemental identification method. The purchaser may \nspecify in the order a specific bar coding system to be used. \nThe bar coding system, if applied at the discretion of the \nsupplier, should be consistent with one of the published \nindustry standards for bar coding. If used on small parts, the \nbar code may be applied to the box or a substantially applied \ntag. \n167 \n16. Keywords \n16.1 pipe fittings, steel; piping applications; pressure con\u00ad\ntaining parts; steel flanges; steel forgings, carbon; steel valves; \ntemperature service applications, elevated; temperature service \napplications, high ",
