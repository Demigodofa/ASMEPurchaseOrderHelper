Retests by Purchaser's Representative \nS2.1 The purchaser's representative may select two nuts per \nkeg (200-lb unit [90-kg]) for sizes 5/s in. and M16 and smaller, \none nut per keg for sizes over 5/s in. and Ml6 up to and \nincluding 1 \u00bd in. and M36, and one nut per every two kegs for \nsizes larger than 1 \u00bd in. and M36, which shall be subjected to \nthe tests specified in Section 8. \nS3. Low-Temperature Requirements for Grade 7, Grade \n7M, and Grade 43 Nuts \nS3.l When low-temperature requirements are specified for \nGrade 7 nuts, the Charpy test procedures and requirements as \ndefined in Specification A320/A320M for Grade L7 shall \napply. When low-temperature requirements are specified for \nGrade 7M nuts, the Charpy test procedures and requirements as \n257 \ndefined in Specification A320/A320M for Grade L7M shall \napply. When low-temperature requirements are specified for \nGrade 43 nuts, the Charpy test procedures and requirements as \ndefined in Specification A320/A320M for Grade L43 shall \napply. Charpy specimens may be taken from a sample nut, nut \nblank, or may be taken from separate test samples of the same \nheat processed through heat treatment with the nuts for which \nthe test is to apply. Impact testing is not required when the bar \nstock or nut is smaller than 5/s in. [16 mm] in diameter. \nS3.2 An \"L\" shall be added to the marking, as shown in \nTable 7, for nuts so tested. \nS4. Proof Load Tests of Large Nuts \nS4.1 Proof load testing of nuts requiling proof loads of over \n160 000 lbf or 705 kN is required. Testing shall be performed \nin accordance with 8.2 to the loads required in Table S4.1 and \nTable S4.2. The maximum load will be based entirely on the \nequipment available. ",
