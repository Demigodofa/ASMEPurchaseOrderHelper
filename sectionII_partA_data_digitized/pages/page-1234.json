Scope \n1.1 This specification covers hot-wrought and cold\u00ad\nfinished special quality carbon steel bars, in straight lengths \nonly, subject to mechanical property requirements and intended \nfor use in manufacturing components for pressure piping and \nother pressure-containing applications. \n1.2 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded \nas standard. The values given in parentheses are mathematical \nconversions to SI units that are provided for information only \nand are not considered standard. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA29/A29M Specification for Steel Bars, Carbon and Alloy, \nHot-Wrought, General Requirements for \nA370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Testing \nof Steel Products \n3. Classification \n3.1 The bars are furnished in two grades as follows: \n3.1.1 Grade B-Tensile strength 60 000 psi (415 MPa), \nminimum; yield strength 35 000 psi (240 MPa), minimum. \n3.1.2 Grade C-Tensile strength 70 000 psi (485 MPa), \nminimum; yield strength 40 000 psi (275 MPa), minimum. \n3.2 The bars are intended for machining, welding, hot \nforming, and threading by machining or cold rolling. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 Orders for material under this specification should \ninclude the following information: \n4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of bars), \n4.1.2 Name of material (carbon steel bars), \n4.1.3 Condition: hot wrought or cold finished (5.4.1), \n4.1.4 Finish (if descaled required, so state) (9.1), \n4.1.5 Dimensions (diameter, thickness, width, and length), \n4.1.6 Cross section (round, square, hexagon), \n4.1.7 ASTM designation and date of issue, \n4.1.8 Grade (Table 1 and Table 2), \n4.1.9 End use, and \n4.1.10 Additions to the specification and supplementary \nrequirements, if required. \nNO'ra 1-A typical ordering description is as follows: 10 000 lb, Carbon \nSteel Bars, Hot Wrought, Descaled, 1.000-in. diameter by 10 ft, Round, \nASTM A696 dated __ , Grade B; Supplementary Requirement Sl \nStraightness 0.125 in. in any 5 ft. \n5. Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 Melting Practice-The steel shall be made by one or \nmore of the following primary processes: open-hearth, basic\u00ad\noxygen, or electric-furnace. The primary melting may incor\u00ad\nporate separate degassing or refining, and may be followed by \nsecondary melting using electroslag remelting or vacuum arc \nremelting. Where secondary melting is employed, the heat \nshall be defined as all of the ingots remelted from a single \nprimary heat. \n5.2 Deoxidation-The steel shall be fully killed. \n5.3 Quality-The bars shall be special quality. \n5.4 Hot or Cold Working: \n5.4.1 The bars shall be hot wrought or cold finished as \nspecified by the purchaser. \n5.4.2 Cold-finished bars reduced in cross-sectional area \nmore than 10 % by cold drawing or rolling shall be heat treated \nas specified in 5.5.2. \n5.5 Heat Treatment: \n5.5.1 Except as provided in 5.5.2, the bars shall be furnished \nas-hot wrought or as-cold finished. \n5.5.2 Cold-finished bars cold worked in excess of 10 % (see \n5.4.2) shall be stress relief annealed at not less than 1200\u00b0F \n(649\u00b0C), normalized, or fully annealed. The specific heat \ntreatment shall be at the option of the manufacturer. \n1148 ",
