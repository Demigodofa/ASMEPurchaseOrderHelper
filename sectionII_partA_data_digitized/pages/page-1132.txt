14.2 Suiface Finish: 
14.2.1 Machined Suifaces - Machined surfaces sub­
ject to ultrasonic inspection shall have a finish that will 
produce an ultrasonic response equivalent to that obtained 
from a 250 µin. (6.3 µm) surface. The surface finish shall 
also permit adequate movement pf search units along the 
surface. 
14.2.2 Casting Suifaces - Casting surfaces to be 
ultrasonically inspected shall be suitable for the intended 
type and quality level (Tables 3 and 4) of inspection as 
judged acceptable by a qualified individual as specified in 
13.1.1. 
14.2.3 Surface Condition - All surfaces to be 
inspected shall be free of scale, machining or grinding 
particles, excessive paint thickness, dirt, or other foreign 
matter that may interfere with the inspection. 
14.3 Position of Casting - The casting shall be posi­
tioned such that the inspector has free access to the back 
wall for the purpose of verifying change in contour. 
15. Calibration 
15.1 Calibration Blocks - Determine the thickness of 
the material to be ultrasonically inspected. For material 
thickness of 3 in. [75 mm] or less, use the series of 3 
blocks, ½, 2, 5 in. [13, 50, 125 mm] (Fig. 3, B dimension) 
for calibration: For a material thickness greater than 3 in., 
use the series of 3 blocks, 2, 5, 10 in. [50, 125, 250 mm] 
(Fig. 3, B dimension) for calibration. 
15.2 Calibration of Search Units - For the thickness 
of material to be inspected, as determined in 15.1, use the 
following search units: 
15.2.1 For materials 3 in. [75 mm] or less in thick­
ness, use a 2¾ MHz, ½ in. [13 mm] diameter search unit. 
15.2.2 For material greater than 3 in. [75 mm] in 
thickness, use a 2¾ MHz, 1 in. [25 mm] diameter search 
unit. 
15.3 Calibration Procedure: 
15.3.1 Set the frequency selector as required. Set the 
reject control in the "OFF" position. 
15.3.2 Position the search unit on the entrant surface 
of the blockthat completely encompasses the metal thick­
ness to be inspected (Fig. 3) and adjust the sweep control 
such that the back reflection signal appears approximately, 
but not more than three-quarters along the sweep line from 
the initial pulse signal. 
15.3.3 Position the search unit on the entrant surface 
of the smallest block of the series of 3 blocks selected for 
calibration and adjust the gain until the back reflection 
signal height (amplitude) is 1.5 in. [40 mm] sweep to 
peak (SIP). Draw a line on the cathode-ray screen (CRT), 
parallel to the sweep line, through the peak of the 1.5 in. 
(SIP) amplitude. 
15.3.4 Position the search unit on the entrant surface 
of the largest block of the series of 3 blocks selected for 
calibration, and adjust the distance amplitude control to 
provide a back reflection signal height of 1.5 in. [40 mm] 
(SIP). 
15.3.5 Position the search unit on the entrant surface 
of the intermediate calibration block of the series of 3 
blocks being used for calibration and confirm that the back 
reflection signal height is approximately 1.5 in. [40 mm] 
(SIP). If it is not, obtain the best compromise between this 
block and the largest block of the series of 3 blocks being 
used for calibration. 
15.3.6 Draw a line on the cathode ray tube screen 
parallel to the sweep line at 0.5 in. [13 mm] (SIP) ampli­
tude. This will be the reference line for reporting disconti­
nuity amplitudes. 
15.3.7 For tests on machined suifaces, position the 
search unit on a machined surface of casting where the 
walls are reasonably parallel and adjust the gain of the 
instrument until the back reflection signal height is 1.5 in. 
[40 mm] (SIP). Increase the inspection sensitivity by a 
factor of three times (10 dB gain) with the calibrated attenu­
ator. Surfaces that do not meet the requirements of 14.2.l 
shall be inspected as specified in 15.3.s: 
15.3.8 For inspections on cast suifaces, position the 
search unit on the casting to be inspected at a location 
where the walls are reasonably parallel and smooth (inside 
and outside diameter) and the surface condition is represen­
tative of the surface being inspected. Adjust the gain of 
the instrument until the back reflection signal height is 
1.5 in. [40 mm] (SIP). Increase the inspection sensitivity 
by a factor of six times (16 dB) by use of the calibrated 
control or attenuator. A significant change in surface finish 
requires a compensating adjustment to the gain. 
15.3.8.1 Rejectable indications on as-cast surfaces 
may be reevaluated by surface preparation to 250 µin. 
[6.3 µm] finish or better, and re-inspected in accordance 
with 15.3.7 of this practice. 
15.3.8.2 It should be noted that some instruments 
are equipped with decibel calibrated gain controls, in which 
case the decibel required to increase the sensitivity must 
be added. Other instruments have decibel calibrated attenu­
ators, in which case the required decibel must be removed. 
Still other instruments do not have calibrated gains or 
attenuators. They require external attenuators. 
16. Scanning 
16.1 Grid Pattern - The surface of the casting shall 
be laid out in a 12 by 12 in. [300 by 300 mm] or any
