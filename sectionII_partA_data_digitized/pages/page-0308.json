Details of these supplementary requirements shall be \nagreed upon in writing by the manufacturer and purchaser. Supplementary requirements shall in no \nway negate any requirement of the specification itself. \nSl. Strain-Hardened Austenitic Steel Nuts \nSl.1 Strain hardened Grades 8, SC, ST, SM, SF, SP, SN, or \n8MN nuts may be specified. When Supplementary Require\u00ad\nment S 1 is invoked in the order, nuts shall be machined from \ncold drawn bars or shall be cold forged to shape. No subse\u00ad\nquent heat treatment shallbe performed on the nuts. Nuts made \n256 \nin accordance with this requirement shall be proof load tested \nin accordance with 8.2.2.1 and shall withstand the proof load \nspecified in Table S 1.1 and Table S 1.2. Testing nuts requiring \nproof loads over 160 000 lbf or 705 kN is only required when \nSupplementary Requirement S4 is invoked. The hardness \nlimits of Table 2 do not apply to strain hardened nuts.
