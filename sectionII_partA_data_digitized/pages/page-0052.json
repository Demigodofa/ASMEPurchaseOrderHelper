The following is a guide to \nthe designation and cross-referencing of subparagraph breakdowns: \n( a) Hierarchy of Subparagraph Breakdowns \n(1) First-level breakdowns are designated as (a), (b), (c), etc. \n(2) Second-level breakdowns are designated as (1), (2), (3), etc. \n(3) Third-level breakdowns are designated as (-a), (-b), (-c), etc. \n(4) Fourth-level breakdowns are designated as (-1), (-2), (-3), etc. \n(SJ Fifth-level breakdowns are designated as ( +a), ( +b), ( +c), etc. \n(6) Sixth-level breakdowns are designated as (+1), (+2), etc. \n(b) Cross-References to Subparagraph Breakdowns. Cross-references within an alphanumerically designated para\u00ad\ngraph ( e.g., PG-1, UIG-56.1, NCD-3223) do not include the alphanumerical designator of that paragraph. The cross\u00ad\nreferences to subparagraph breakdowns follow the hierarchy of the designators under which the breakdown appears. \nThe following examples show the format: \n(1) If X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.1(c)(1), it will be referenced as (-a). \n(2) if X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.1(c)(2), it will be referenced as (1)(-a). \n(3) If X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.1(e)(1), it will be referenced as (c)(l)(-a). \n(4) If X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.2(c)(2), it will be referenced as X.1(c)(1)(-a).
