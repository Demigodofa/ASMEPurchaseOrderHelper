A The yield strength tends to increase and the elongation tends to decrease as the 
sheet thickness decreases. These properties represent those typical of material in 
the thickness range of 0.100 to 0.150 in. [2.5 to 3.5 mm] for CS Types A, B, and 
DS Types A and Band in the thickness ranges of 0.060 to 0.075 in. (1.5 to 1.9 mm] 
for CS Type D. 
8 The typical mechanical property values presented here are nonmandatory. They 
are provided to assist the purchaser in specifying a suitable steel for a given 
application. Values outside these ranges are to be expected. 
0 Yield strength and elongation are measured in the longitudinal direction in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
8.2.1.1 For SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS, a report is 
required of mechanical properties as determined by the tension 
test. 
8.2.2 Tension Tests: 
8.2.2.1 Requirements-Material as represented by the test 
specimen shall conform to the mechanical property require­
ments specified in Table 4. These requirements do not apply to 
the uncropped ends of unprocessed coils. 
8.2.2.2 Number of Tests-Two tension tests shall be made 
from each heat or from each 50 tons [45 000 kg]. When the 
amount of finished material from a heat is less than 50 tons 
[45 000 kg], one tension test shall be made. When material 
rolled from one heat differs 0.050 in. [1.27 mm] or more in 
thickness, one tension test shall be made from the thickest and 
thinnest material regardless of the weight represented. 
8.2.2.3 Tension test specimens shall be taken at a point 
immediately adjacent to the material to be qualified. 
8.2.2.4 Tension test specimens shall be taken from the full 
thickness of the sheet as-rolled. 
8.2.2.5 Tension test specimens shall be taken from a loca­
tion approximately halfway between the center of sheet and the 
edge of the material as-rolled. 
8.2.2.6 Tension test specimens shall be taken with the 
lengthwise axis of the test specimen parallel to the rolling 
direction (longitudinal test). 
8.2.2.7 Test Method-Yield strength shall be determined by 
either the 0.2 % offset method or the 0.5 % extension under 
load method unless otherwise specified. 
8.2.3 Bending Properties: 
8.2.3.1 The suggested minimum inside radii for cold bend­
ing are listed in Appendix Xl and is discussed in more detail 
in Specifications A568/A568M (6.6) and A749/A749M (7.6). 
Where a tighter bend radius is required, where curved or offset 
bends are involved, or where stretching or drawing are also a 
consideration, the producer shall be consulted. 
9. Finish and Appearance 
9.1 Surface Finish: 
9.1.1 Unless otherwise specified, the material shall be fur­
nished as rolled, that is, without removing the hot-rolled oxide 
or scale. 
9.1.2 When required, it is permissible to specify that the 
material be pickled or blast cleaned (descaled). 
9.2 Oiling: 
9.2.1 Unless otherwise specified, as-rolled material shall be 
furnished not oiled (that is, dry), and pickled or blast cleaned 
material shall be furnished oiled. 
9.3 Edges: 
9.3.1 Steel sheet is available with mill edge or cut edge. 
9.3.2 Steel strip is available with mill edge or cut edge. 
10. Retests and Disposition of Non-Conforming Material 
10.1 Retests, conducted. in accordance with the require­
ments of Section 11.1 of Specification A568/ A568M, are 
permitted when an unsatisfactorily test result is suspected to be 
the consequence of the test method procedure. 
10.2 Disposition of non-conforming material shall be sub­
ject to the requirements of Section 11.2 of Specification 
A568/ A568M. 
11. Product Marking 
11.1 In addition to the requirements of Specification A568/ 
A568M for sheet and Specification A749/A749M for strip, 
each lift or coil shall be marked with the designation shown on 
theorder(CS (Type A, B, orC), OS (TypeAorB), SFS (Grade, 
Carbon or Manganese or both), SS (Grade and for SS36, Type), 
HSLAS (Grade and Class), HSLAS-F (Grade), or UHSS (Type 
and Grade)). The designation shall be legibly stenciled on the 
top of each lift or shown on a tag attached to each coil or 
shipping unit.
