against the bottom surface of the web and measuring the amount of toe-in or toe-out of either flange. Measurements for depth of section and width of flanges are over-all.

subject to a minimum length requirement, permissible variation is 2 ft [0.6 m] over 
and nothing under the specified length.

flaws, it is permitted to discard the specimen and to substitute 
another specimen.

TABLE 19 Twist Tolerances 
NOTE 1-The amount of spiraling in an extruded shape is called twist. 
It can be measured by the height of the high comer from a flat reference 
base (established rise).

exceed what is shown in the table.

If one of the retest specimens fails, the lot shall be rejected. 
13. Retreatment 
13.1 Where the failure of a lot is attributable to inadequate 
heat treatment, the producer may reheat treat the material and 
submit the retreated material for test. 
14. Test Methods 
14.1 The properties enumerated in the applicable product 
specification shall be tested in accordance with the following
