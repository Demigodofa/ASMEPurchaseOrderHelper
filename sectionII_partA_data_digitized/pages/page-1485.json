Melting and Forging \n4.1 In addition to the melting and forging requirements of \nSpecification A 788/ A 788M, which may include Supplemen\u00ad\ntary Requirement S8, the following condition applies: \n4.1.1 A sufficient discard shall be made to secure freedom \nfrom injurious pipe and undue segregation. \n5. Machining \n5.1 Forged pressure vessels for steam power service shall \nhave the inner surface machined or ground. Unfired pressure \nvessels shall have the inner surfaces sufficiently free of scale to \npermit inspection. \n5.2 When rough machining is pe1formed, it may be done \neither before or after heat treatment. \n6. Heat Treatment \n6.1 Forgings shall be furnished in the solution treated \ncondition. On completion of forging operations, the forgings \nshall be solution annealed and quenched in water, oil, or a \npolymer water solution. Direct quenching after completion of \nforging without subsequent reheating to the temperatures \nprescribed in 6.2 - 6.12 is not permissible. \n6.2 For Grades F304H, F309H, F310H, F316H, F321H, \nF347H, and F348H, the minimum solution annealing tempera\u00ad\nture shall be 1925 \u00b0F [1050 \u00b0C]. \n6.3 Grade FXM-11 shall be solution annealed at a minimum \nof 1950 \u00b0F [1065 \u00b0C]. \n6.4 Grade F20 shall be solution annealed in the temperature \nrange of 1700 \u00b0F to 1850 \u00b0F [925 \u00b0C to 1010 \u00b0C]. \n6.5 Grade F46 shall be solution annealed in the temperature \nrange of 2010 \u00b0F to 2140 \u00b0F [1100 \u00b0C to 1170 \u00b0C]. \n6.6 Grade F62 shall be solution annealed at a minimum of \n2025 \u00b0F [1107 \u00b0C]. \n6.7 Grade F904L shall be solution annealed in the tempera\u00ad\nture range of 1920 \u00b0F to 2100 \u00b0F [1050 \u00b0C to 1150 \u00b0C]. \n6.8 Grade F700 shall be solution annealed in the tempera\u00ad\nture range of 2025 \u00b0F to 2100 \u00b0F [1107 \u00b0C to 1150 \u00b0C]. \n6.9 Grades FNIC and Fl925 shall be solution annealed in \nthe temperature range of 1800 \u00b0F to 1900 \u00b0F [985 \u00b0C to \n1040 \u00b0C]. \n6.10 Grades FNIClO and FNICll shall be solution annealed \nin the temperature range of 2100 \u00b0F to 2150 \u00b0F [1150 \u00b0C to \n1180 \u00b0C]. \n6.11 Grade Fl925N shall be solution annealed at a mini\u00ad\nmum of 2150 \u00b0F [1180 \u00b0C]. \n6.12 The remaining grades in Table 1 shall be solution \nannealed at a minimum temperature of 1900 \u00b0F [1040 \u00b0C]. \n7. Chemical Composition \n7 .1 Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam\u00ad\npling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall \ncomply with Table 1. \n7 .2 Product Analysis-The manufacturer shall use the prod\u00ad\nuct analysis provision of Specification A 788/ A 788M to obtain \na product analysis from a forging representing each heat or \nmultiple heat. The product analysis tolerances for carbon shall \nnot apply, and the carbon requirements shall conform to Table \n1. \n7.3 Types (common names) and UNS designations follow: \nGrade Type UNS Designation \nF304 304 S30400 \nF304H 304H S30409 \nF304L 304L S30403 \nF304N 304N S30451 \nF304LN 304LN S30453 \nF309H 309H S30909 \nF310 310 S31000 \nF310H 310H S31009 \nF316 316 S31600 \nF316H 316H S31609 \nF316L 316L S31603 \nF316N 316N S31651 \nF316LN 316LN S31653 \nF70 S31730 \nF321 321 S32100 \nF321H 321H S32109 \nF347 347 S34700 \nF347H 347H S34709 \nF347LN 347LN S34751 \nF348 348 S34800 \nF348H 348H S34809 \nFXM-19 XM19 S20910 \nFXM-11 XM11 S21904 \nF20 Alloy 20 N08020 \nF46 S30600 \nF62 N08367 \nF904L 904L N08904 \nF700 N08700 \nFNIC NIC NOBBOO \nFNIC10 NIC10 N08810 \nFNIC11 NIC11 N08811 \nF1925 1925 N08925 \nF1925N 1925N N08926 \n8. Mechanical Properties \n8.1 Requirements-The material shall conform to the re\u00ad\nquirements for mechanical properties prescribed in Table 2 or, \nif applicable, Supplementary Requirement S2. The largest \nobtainable tension test specimen as specified in Test Methods \nand Definitions A370 or Test Methods A1058 shall be used. \n8.2 Number of Tests-The number and location of tests are \nbased on the heat-treated weight of the forging(s) from the \nsame heat, solution annealed in the same furnace charge. \n8.2.1 For forgings weighing less than 5000 lb [2250 kg] as \nheat treated, one tension test shall be required on the basis of \none test per heat in each heat treatment load. This test shall be \ntaken from a prolongation of one of the forgings. Use of a \n1427 ",
