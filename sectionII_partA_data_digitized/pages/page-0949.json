Permissible Variations in Dimensions for Round \nTubing \n8.1 Diameter and Wall Thickness (Hot-Rolled Steel)\u00ad\nVariations from specified outside diameter for \"as-welded\" and \n\"as-welded and annealed\" tubing made from hot-rolled steel \nshall not exceed the amounts prescribed in Table 4. Permissible \nvariations in outside diameter for tubing that has been sink\u00ad\ndrawn for closer tolerance on outside diameter are shown in \nTable 5. Permissible variations in wall thickness for tubing that \nhas been sink-drawn for closer tolerances on outside diameters \nare \u00b1 10 % of the nominal wall or \u00b10.010 in.

Permissible variation in outside and inside diameter for \ntubing made from hot-rolled steel that has been Drawn Over a \nMandrel (DOM) for closer tolerances are shown in Table 5 \nwith wall tolerances shown in Tables 8 and 9. \n8.2 Diameter and Wall Thickness (Cold-Rolled Steel)\u00ad\nVariations in outside diameter and inside diameter of \"as\u00ad\nwelded\" and \"as-welded and annealed\" tubing made from \ncold-rolled steel are shown in Table 10. Outside diameter \ntolerances for cold-rolled steel tubing, sink drawn and DOM, \nare shown in Table 5. Wall thickness tolerances for \"as\u00ad\nwelded\" tubing made from cold-rolled steel are shown in \nTables 11 and 12. Permissible variations in wall thickness for \nround tubing, DOM for closer tolerances, are shown in Tables \n8 and 9. Permissible variations in wall thickness for tubing that \nhas been sink-drawn for closer tolerances on outside diameter \nare \u00b1 10 % of the nominal wall or \u00b10.010 in.

Permissible Variations in Dimensions of Square and \nRectangular Tubing \n9.1 Diameter and Wall Thickness-Permissible variations in \noutside dimensions for square and rectangular tubing shall be \nas given in Table 16. The wall thickness tolerance is \u00b1 10 % of \nthe nominal wall thickness. \n9.2 Comer Radii-Unless otherwise specified, the comers \nof square and rectangular tubing shall be slightly rounded \ninside and outside, consistent with wall thickness. The outside \ncomers may be slightly flattened. The radii of corners shall be \nas given in Table 17. \n9.3 Squareness-Permissible variations for squareness shall \nbe determined by the following equation: \n\u00b1b = c x 0.006 in.
