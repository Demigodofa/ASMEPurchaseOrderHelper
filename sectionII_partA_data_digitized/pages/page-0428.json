At least two of the three tests \nshall show not more than 50 % separation on both edges of the \nbent portion. Greater separation shall be cause for rejection. \n7.3 Methods and practices relating to mechanical testing \nrequired by this specification shall be in accordance with the \nTest Methods and Definitions of A370. \n8. Number of Tests and Retests \n8.1 One or more tension tests, as required by the specifica\u00ad\ntions for the base metal and, when specified, one shear test or \nthree bond bend tests shall be made representing each plate as \nrolled. Each specimen shall be in the final condition of heat \ntreatment required for the plate, including any SPWHT if \nrequired. \n8.2 If any test specimen shows defective machining or \ndevelops flaws, it may be discarded and another specimen \nsubstituted. \n9. Test Specimens \n9.1 The tension test specimens from plate shall conform to \nthe requirements prescribed in the specifications for the base \nmetal. \n9.2 Bend test specimens for the alternative bond strength \ntests shall be taken at right angles to longitudinal axis of the \nplate. \n9.3 When required by the purchaser, the shear test specimen \nshould be taken near a corner of the plate, parallel to its \nlongitudinal axis, or other location that is representative of the \nfinal product. \n9.4 For plates 1 \u00bd in. (38 mm) and under in thickness \ntension test specimens shall be full thickness of the material \nexcept as specified in 7.1.2 and 7.1.3. \n9.5 For plates over 1 \u00bd in. (38 mm) in thickness, tension \ntests shall be of the form shown in Fig. 3 and shall be of all \nbase steel conforming to the requirements of the specification \nfor the base steel. \n376 \n9.6 The bend test specimen used for bond strength determi\u00ad\nnation shall be 1\u00bd in.
