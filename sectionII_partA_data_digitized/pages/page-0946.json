A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon ( e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification covers electric-resistance-welded car\u00ad\nbon and alloy steel tubing for use as mechanical tubing. \n1.2 This specification covers mechanical tubing made from \nhot- or cold-rolled steel. \n1.3 This specification covers round, square, rectangular, and \nspecial shape tubing. \nType \nElectric-Resistance-Welded Tubing \nfrom Hot-Rolled Steel \nElectric-Resistance-Welded Tubing \nfrom Cold-Rolled Steel \nSize Range \n(Round Tubing) \noutside diameter from\u00bd to 15 in. \n[12.7 to 380 mm] \nwall from 0.065 to 0.650 in. \n[1.65 to 16.5 mm] \noutside diameter from% to 12 in. \n[9.5 to 300 mm] \nwall from 0.022 to 0.134 in. \n[0.56 to 3.40 mm] \n1.3.1 Indeterminate wall thicknesses may be ordered. In \nthose cases the more stringent tolerances of Tables 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, \n10, 11, 12, 16, and 17 shall apply. When sizes within the \nallowable ranges lj.I'e ordered all other requirements of the \nspecification shall be met. \nhard or rationalized conversions apply to diameters, lengths \nand tensile properties. Soft conversion applies to other SI \nmeasurements. \n1.7 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Tra1e (TBT) Committee. \n2.
