3. Terminology 
3 .1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 annealing-material shall be uniformly reheated to a 
temperature above the transformation range and, after holding 
for a sufficient time at this temperature, cooled slowly to a 
temperature below the transformation range. 
3.1.2 bar-a solid rolled or forged section that is long in 
relationship to its cross-sectional dimensions with a relatively 
constant cross section throughout its length. See Specification 
A29/A29M for definitions relating to the production of hot 
wrought and cold finished bars. 
3.1.3 bolting-a general term which includes bolting ma­
terials (rolled or forged bars or blanks, wire, rod, threaded bar, 
rotary pierced or extruded seamless tubes, bored bars, or forged 
hollows from forged or rolled bar segments), which are 
manufactured into bolting components, including but not
