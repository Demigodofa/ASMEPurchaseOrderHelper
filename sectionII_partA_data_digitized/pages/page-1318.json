Scope \n1.1 This specification covers a group of requirements \nthat are mandatory requirements of the following steel \ncasting specifications issued by ASTM. lfthe product spec\u00ad\nification specifies different requirements, the product speci\u00ad\nfication shall prevail. \nASTM \nDesignation \nA27/A27M \nA 128/A 128M \nA 148/A 148M \nA297/A297M \nA447/A447M \nA494/A494M \nA560/A560M \nA 743/A 743M \nA 744/A 744M \nA 747/A 747M \nA890/A890M \nA 915/A 915M \nA958 \nA 1002 \nTitle of Specification \nSteel Castings, Carbon, for General Appli\u00ad\ncation \nSteel Castings, Anstenitic Manganese \nSteel Castings, High-Strength, for Struc\u00ad\ntural Purposes \nSteel Castings, Iron-Chromium and Iron\u00ad\nChromium-Nickel, Heat-Resistant for \nGeneral Application \nSteel Castings, Chromium-Nickel-Iron \nAlloy (25-12 Class), for High-Tempera\u00ad\nture Service \nCastings, Nickel and Nickel Alloy \nCastings, Chromium-Nickel Alloy \nCastings, Iron-Chromium, Iron-Chromium-\nNickel, Corrosion Resistant, for General \nApplication \nCastings, Iron-Chromium-Nickel, Corrosion \nResistant, for Severe Service \nSteel Castings, Stainless, Precipitation Hard\u00ad\nening \nCastings, Iron-Chromium-Nickel-Molybde\u00ad\nnum Corrosion-Resistant, Duplex \n(Austenitic/Ferritic) for General Appli\u00ad\ncation \nSteel Castings, Carbon and Alloy Chemical \nRequirements Similar to Standard \nWrought Grades \nSteel Castings, Carbon and Alloy, with Ten\u00ad\nsile Requirements, Chemical Require\u00ad\nments Similar to Standard Wrought \nGrades \nCastings, Nickel-Aluminum Ordered Alloy \n1.2 This specification also covers a group of supple\u00ad\nmentary requirements that may be applied to the above \nspecifications as indicated therein. These are provided for \nuse when additional testing or inspection is desired and \napply only when specified individually by the purchaser \nin the order. \n1.3 The requirements of the individual material speci\u00ad\nfication, and this general specification shall prevail in the \nsequence named. \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \nunits are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the \ntext, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated \nin each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem must be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in nonconformance \nwith the specification. Inch-pound units are applicable for \nmaterial ordered to Specification A 781 and SI units for \nmaterial ordered to Specification A 781M. \n2.
