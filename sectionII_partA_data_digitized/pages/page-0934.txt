S8. Charpy Impact Test 
S8.1 In addition to the requirements listed in S8 of Speci­
fications A703/A703M and A985/A985M, the following spe­
cific requirements apply to this specification: 
S8.1.1 When S8 is specified for Grades lB, 2B, 4B, 6B, 7 A, 
8B, 9B, or lOB, impact properties shall be determined by 
performing a Charpy V-notch impact test at -50 °P [-46 °C] 
with a specific minimum average value of 15 ft-lb [20 J] and a 
specified minimum single value of 10 ft-lb [14 J]. Other 
temperatures may be used upon agreement between the manu­
facturer and the purchaser, in which case S8.1.3 shall apply. 
Other higher specified minimum average and single values 
may be used upon agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
S8.1.2 Impact requirements for grades other than lB, 2B, 
4B, 6B, 7 A, 8B, 9B, and lOB shall be agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
S8.1.3 When an impact test temperature other than -50 °P 
[-46 °C] is used for those grades listed in S8.1.1, the lowest 
test . temperature at which the material meets the impact 
requrrements shall be stamped with low-stress stamps imme­
diately ahead of the material symbol on the raised pad (for 
example, 25 lOB for +25 °P [-4 °C] and 025 lOB for -25 °P 
[-32 °C]). 
S10. Examination of Weld Preparation 
S10.1 The method of performing the magnetic particle or 
liquid penetrant test shall be in accordance with Guide E709 or 
Practice E165/E165M.
