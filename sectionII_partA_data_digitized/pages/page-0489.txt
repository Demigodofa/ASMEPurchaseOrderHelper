A See Specification A20/A20M for elongation adjustment. 
NoTE I-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat 
treatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are reported for 
each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plates from coil 
are described in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and 
shall conform to the fine grain size requirement of Specifica­
tion A20/ A20M. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 Plates 2 in. [50 mm] and under in thickness are normally 
supplied in the as-rolled condition. Plates may be ordered 
normalized, nonnalized and tempered, or stress relieved. 
5.2 Plates over 2 in. [50 mm] in thickness shall be normal­
ized or normalized and tempered. 
5.3 When normalizing plates 4 in. [100 mm] or over in 
thickness, the cooling rate may be accelerated by air blasting or 
liquid quenching followed by tempering in the temperature 
range from 1100 to 1300°F [595 to 705°C] to obtain mechani­
cal properties comparable to those developed by normalizing 
plates in the lesser thicknesses.

5.4 If approved by the purchaser, for plates less than 4 in. 
[100 mm] in thickness, cooling rates faster than those obtained 
by cooling in air are permissible for improvement of 
toughness, provided the plates are subsequently tempered in 
the temperature range from 1100 to 1300°F [595 to 705°C]. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements 
shown in Table I unless otherwise modified in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement S 17, Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized 
Steel, in Specification A20/A20M. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7 .1 Tension Test Requirements-The plates, as represented 
by the tension test specimens, shall conform to the require­
ments given in Table 2. 
437 
7 .1.1 For accelerated cooled plates with a nominal thickness 
of¾ in. [20 mm] or less, the 1 ½-in. [ 40-mm] wide rectangular 
specimen may be used for the tension test, and the elongation 
may be detennined in a 2-in. [50-mm] gage length that 
includes the fracture and that shows the greatest elongation.
