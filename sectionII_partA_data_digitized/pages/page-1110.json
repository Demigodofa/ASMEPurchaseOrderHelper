Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n10.1 Discontinuities - The surface discontinuities for \nthese products shall conform to Specification \nF 788/F 788M and the additional limitations specified \nherein. \n10.2 Socket Discontinuities: \n10.2.1 Depth of discontinuities in the socket area \nwill be permissible within the limits of Condition 1 pro\u00ad\nvided they do not affect the usability and performance of \nthe screw. Discontinuities exceeding these limits are not \nacceptable. \n10.2.2 Longitudinal discontinuities must not exceed \n0.25T in length. Permissible and nonpermissible disconti\u00ad\nnuities are shown in Fig. 2. \nNOTE 2 - T = actual key engagement. \n10.3 Permissible Head and Body Discontinuities- Dis\u00ad\ncontinuities as defined above are permitted in the locations \nillustrated in Fig. 3 to the depths shown in 10.4. These \ndiscontinuities are permitted, provided they do not affect \nthe usability and performance of the screw. All discontinu\u00ad\nities are to be measured perpendicular to indicated surfaces. \n10.4 Conditions for Permissible Discontinuity Depths: \n10.4.1 Condition 1 - For bearing area, fillet, and \nother surfaces, max depth = 0.03D or 0.005 in. (whichever \nis greater). \nNOTE 3 - D = nominal diameter of screw. \n10.4.2 Condition 2 - For peripheral discontinuities, \nmax depth = 0.06D, but not to exceed 0.064. \n10.5 Thread Discontinuities - Threads shall have no \nlaps at the root or on the flanks located below the pitch \nline. Laps are permissible at the thread crest to a depth of \n25% of the basic thread height and on the thread flanks \nbeyond the pitch diameter. Longitudinal seams in the \nthreads are acceptable within the limits of Condition 1 \n(10.4.1). \n11. Number of Tests and Retests \n11.1 The requirements of this specification shall be met \nin continuous mass production for stock, and the manufac\u00ad\nturer shall make sample inspections to ensure that the prod\u00ad\nuct conforms to the specified requirements. Additional tests \nof individual shipments of material are not ordinalily con\u00ad\ntemplated. A record of individual heats of steel in each \ntest lot shall be maintained. The container shall be coded \nto permit identification of the lot. \n11.2 When specified in the order, the manufacturer \nshall furnish a test report certified to be the last complete \nset of mechanical tests for each stock size in each shipment. \n11.3 When additional tests are specified on the purchase \norder, a lot, for purposes of selecting test samples, shall \nconsist of all screws offered for inspection at one time of \none diameter and length. From each lot, the number of \nsamples for each requirement shall be as follows: \nNumber of Pieces in Lot \n800 and less \nOver 800 to 8 000, incl. \nOver 8 000 to 22 000, incl. \nOver 22 000 \nNumber of Samples \n1 \n2 \n3 \n5 \n11.4 Should any sample fail to meet the requirements \nof a specified test, double the number of samples from the \nsame lot shall be retested for the requirement(s) in which \nit failed. All of the additional samples shall conform to \nthe specification or the lot shall be rejected. \n12. Test Methods \n12.1 Test the finished screws and specimens, as applica\u00ad\nble, for mechanical properties and hardness requirements \nof Section 7. Testing shall be in accordance with Test \nMethods F 606 at room temperature. The minimum \nrequired length for tension testing shall be 3D. The angle \nused in wedge tests shall be as specified in Table 4. \n12.2 The speed of testing, as determined with a free \nrunning crosshead, shall be a maximum of 1 in./min for \nthe tension tests of screws. \n12.3 Decarburization and carburization tests shall be \nconducted as follows: \n12.3.1 Section the thread area of the bolt longitudi\u00ad\nnally through the axis, mount, and polish it in accordance \nwith Practice E 3. Take measurements (1) at the minor \ndiameter in the center of the thread ridge, and (2) 0.75h \ntoward the thread crest on the perpendicular bisector of \nthe thread ridge. Take a measurement ( 3) on the thread \nflank approximately at the pitch line at a depth of 0.003 in. \nUse one of the two methods for carburization/decarburiza\u00ad\ntion evaluation either optical or microhardness measure\u00ad\nments. The microhardness measurement shall constitute a \nreferee method in case of dispute. \n12.3.2 For optical measurement, etch the section in \n2 to 4% nital. Examine the surface of the etched samples \nunder a microscope at IO0x using a measuring eyepiece \ngraduated in 0.001-in. increments. The width of any light \netching band normally defines the decarburization depth. A \ndark etching band indicates the possibility of carburization. \n12.3.3 Measure microhardness in accordance with \nTest Method E 384 on unetched specimens using a DPH \n136\u00b0 indenter or a Knoop indenter using the following load \napplication: \n1016 ",
