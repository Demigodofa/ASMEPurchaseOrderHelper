Analyses shall conform to the \nwelding procedure for deposited weld metal. \n7.3 Analysis may be taken from the mechanical test speci\u00ad\nmens. The results of the analyses shall be reported to the \npurchaser. \n8. Mechanical Requirements \n8.1 Tension Test: \n8.1.1 All welded pipe manufactured to this specification \nmust have a cross weld tensile test after final heat treatment, \nand the results must match the base material requirements for \nultimate tensile strength of the specified plate material. \nAdditionally, grades CD XX and CJ XXX, when these are of \nClass 3x, 4x, or 5x, and Grade CP of 6x and 7x shall have a \ntransverse base metal tensile test performed on specimens cut \nfrom finished pipe. The results of these tests shall meet the \nminimum mechanical test requirements of the plate specifica\u00ad\ntion. \n8.1.2 Number of Tests-One test specimen of weld metal \nand one specimen of base metal, if required by 8.1.1, shall be \nmade and tested to represent each lot of finished pipe. \n8.1.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation-The test \nspecimens shall be taken transverse to the weld at the end of \nthe finished pipe and may be flattened cold before final \nmachining to size. \n8.1.4 Test Method-The test specimen shall be made in \naccordance with QW-150 in Section IX of the ASME Boiler \nand Pressure Vessel Code. The test specimen shall be tested at \nroom temperature in accordance with Test Methods and Defi\u00ad\nnitions A370. \n8.2 Transverse Guided Weld Bend Test: \n8.2.1 Requirements-The bend test shall be acceptable if no \ncracks or other defects exceeding 1/s in. [3 mm] in any direction \nare present in the weld metal or between the weld and the base \nmetal after bending. Cracks that originate along the edges of \nthe specimen during testing, and that are less than\u00bc irr. [6 mm] \nmeasured in any direction shall not be considered. \n8.2.2 Number of Tests-One test (two specimens) shall be \nmade to represent each lot of finished pipe. \n8.2.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation-Two bend \ntest specimens shall be taken transverse to the weld at the end \nof the finished pipe. As an alternative, by agreement between \nthe purchaser and the manufacturer, the test specimens may be \ntaken from a test plate of the same material as the pipe, the test \nplate being attached to the end of the cylinder and welded as a \nprolongation of the pipe longitudinal seam. \n8.2.4 Test Method-The test requirements of A370, A2.5.1. 7 \nshall be met. For wall thicknesses over 3 /s in. [10 mm] but less \nthan\u00be in. [19 mm] side-bend tests may be made instead of the \nface and root-bend tests. For wall thicknesses\u00be in. [19 mm] \nand over both specimens shall be subjected to the side-bend \ntest. \n8.3 Pressure Test-Classes X2 and X3 pipe shall be tested in \naccordance with Specification A530/A530M, Hydrostatic Test \nRequirements. \n9. Radiographic Examination \n9.1 The full length of each weld of Classes Xl and X2 shall \nbe radiographically examined in accordance with and meet the \nrequirements of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, \nSection VIII, Paragraph UW-51. \n9.2 Radiographic examination may be performed prior to \nheat treatment. \n10. Rework \n10.1 Elimination of Surface lmpeifections-Vnacceptable \nsurface imperfections shall be removed by grinding or machin\u00ad\ning. The remaining thickness of the section shall be no less than \nthe minimum specified in Section 11. The depression after \ngrinding or machining shall be blended uniformly into the \nsurrounding surface. \n10.2 Repair of Base Metal Defects by Welding: \n10.2.1 The manufacturer may repair, by welding, base metal \nwhere defects have been removed, provided the depth of the \nrepair cavity as prepared for welding does not exceed 1/3 of the \nnominal thickness and the requirements of 10.2.2, 10.2.3, \n10.2.4, 10.2.5 and 10.2.6 are met. Base metal defects in excess \nof these may be repaired with prior approval of the customer. \n10.2.2 The defect shall be removed by suitable mechanical \nor thermal cutting or gouging methods and the cavity prepared \nfor repair welding. \n10.2.3 The welding procedure and welders or welding \noperators are to be qualified in accordance with Section IX of \nthe ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. \n10.2.4 The full length of the repaired pipe shall be heat \ntreated after repair in accordance with the requirements of the \npipe class specified. \n10.2.5 Each repair weld of a defect where the cavity, \nprepared for welding, has a depth exceeding the lesser of 3/s in. \n[10 mm] or 10 % of the nominal thickness shall be examined \nby radiography in accordance with the methods and the \nacceptance standards of Section 9. \n10.2.6 The repair surface shall be blended uniformly into \nthe surrounding base metal surface and examined and accepted \nin accordance with Supplementary Requirements S6 or S8. \n10.3 Repair of Weld Metal Defects by Welding: \n10.3.1 The manufacturer may repair weld metal defects ifhe \nmeets the requirements of 10.2.3, 10.2.4, 10.3.2, 10.3.3 and \n10.4. \n10.3.2 The defect shall be removed by suitable mechanical \nor thermal cutting or gouging methods and the repair cavity \nexamined and accepted in accordance with Supplementary \nRequirements S7 or S9. \n10.3.3 The weld repair shall be blended uniformly into the \nsurrounding metal surfaces and examined and accepted in \naccordance with 9.1 and with Supplementary Requirements S7 \nor S9. \n10.4 Retest-Bach length of repaired pipe of a class requir\u00ad\ning a pressure test shall be hydrostatically tested following \nrepair. \n1101 ",
