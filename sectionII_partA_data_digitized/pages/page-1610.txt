6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements specified in 
Table 1 (see Note 2). 
Norn 2-The role of alloying elements in the development of Grade 
C91 has been extensively investigated. V and Cb (Nb) contribute to 
precipitation strengthening by forming fine and coherent precipitation of 
M(C, N)X carbo-nitrides in the ferrite matrix. V also precipitates as VN 
during tempering or during creep. The two elements are more effective in 
combination. Therefore, the addition of strong nitride-forming elements, 
those with a stronger affinity for nitrogen than Cb (Nb) and V, as 
de-oxidation agents interferes with these high-temperature strengthening 
mechanisms. 6 Grade C933 also requires V and Nb to contribute to 
precipitation strengthening along with a strong dependence on Boron and 
Nitrogen levels. Consequently, the addition of strong nitride-forming 
elements with stronger affinity for nitrogen than Nb, V, and B must also be 
avoided. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7 .1 Tensile Testing: 
7 .1.1 One tension test shall be made from each heat per heat 
treatment lot. Test results shall conform to the tensile require­
ments specified in Table 2. 
7 .1.2 If a specimen is machined improperly or if flaws are 
revealed by machining or during testing, the specimen may be 
discarded and another substituted from the same heat. 
7.1.3 Except as permitted by 7.1.4, and except for invest­
ment castings, test coupons from which tension test specimens 
are prepared shall be removed from heat-treated casting 
prolongations. 
7 .1.4 When agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser, test coupons from which test specimens are pre­
pared shall be cast as separate blocks from the same heat as the 
casting represented. The test blocks shall be heat treated in the 
same manner as the casting represented.

c When ICI test bars are used in tensile testing as provided for in Specification 
A703/A703M or A985/A985M for investment castings, the gauge length to reduced 
section diameter ratio shall be 4 to 1. 
7.2 Hardness Testing-Each casting shall be tested in ac­
cordance with Supplementary Requirement S13 of Specifica­
tion A 703/ A 703M or A985/ A985M for investment castings 
and shall have a Brinell hardness of 185 to 248 HBW for Grade 
C91 castings, or 195 to 270 HBW for Grade C933. 
8. Quality 
8.1 All accessible surfaces of the castings shall be examined 
visually and shall be free of adhering sand, scale, cracks, and 
hot tears. Other surface discontinuities shall meet the visual 
acceptance standards specified in the order. Practice A802/ 
A802M or other visual standards may be used to define 
acceptable surface discontinuities and finish. Unacceptable 
visual surface discontinuities shall be removed and their 
removal verified by visual examination of the resultant cavi­
ties. When methods involving high temperatures are used in 
the removal of discontinuities, castings shall be preheated to at 
least 400 °F [200 °C]. 
8.2 Except for centrifugally cast pipe, hollow castings larger 
than NPS 4 [DN 100] and whose internal surfaces are not 
accessible to the visual examination in 8.1 shall be examined 
by the ultrasonic examination prescribed in Supplementary 
Requirement S7 of Specification A703/A703M; or for invest­
ment castings, Supplementary Requirement S7 of Specification 
A985/ A985M. 
8.2.1 Castings producing a signal equal to or greater than 
the lowest signal produced by the referenced discontinuities 
shall be considered to contain defects, and they shall be 
identified and separated from the acceptable castings. The area 
producing the signal may be re-examined. 
8.2.2 Castings containing defects shall be rejected if the test 
signals were produced by imperfections that cannot be identi­
fied or were produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. 
8.2.3 Castings containing defects may be repaired. To be 
accepted, a repaired casting shall pass the ultrasonic examina­
tion and shall meet the minimum wall thickness requirements 
of the purchase order. 
8.3 Each length of centrifugally cast pipe shall be ultrasoni­
cally examined in accordance with Specification A999/ 
A999M. 
8.4 When additional inspection is desired, Supplementary 
Requirements S4, S5, S6, and SlO of Specification A703/ 
A703M; or, for investment castings, Specification A985/ 
A985M, may be ordered.
