FIG. A2.9 Reverse Flattening Test 
A2.5.l.3 Crush Test-The crush test, sometimes referred to 
as an upsetting test, is usually made on boiler and other 
pressure tubes, for evaluating ductility (see Fig. A2.10). The 
specimen is a ring cut from the tube, usually about 2½ in. 
(63.5 mm) long. It is placed on end and crushed endwise by 
hammer or press to the distance prescribed by the applicable 
material specifications. 
A2.5 .1.4 Flange Test-The flange test is intended to deter­
mine the ductility of boiler tubes and their ability to withstand 
the operation of bending into a tube sheet. The test is made on
