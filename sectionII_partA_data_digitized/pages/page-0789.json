Terminology \n3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.1.1 remelted heat-in secondary melting, all of the ingots \nremelted from a single primary heat. \n3.1.2 thin-wall tube-a tube meeting the specified outside \ndiameter and specified wall thickness set forth as follows: \nSpecified Outside Specified Wall Thickness \nDiameter \n2 in. [50.8 mm] or less 2 % or less of specified outside diameter \nGreater than 2 in. [50.8 mm] 3 % or less of specified outside diameter \nAny 0.020 in. [0.5 mm] or less \n3.2 Other defined terms-The definitions in Test Methods \nand Definitions A370, Test Methods, Practices, and Terminol\u00ad\nogy A751, and Terminology A941 are applicable to this \nspecification and to those listed in 1. 1. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the \npurchase order all ordering information necessary to purchase \nthe needed material. Examples of such infonnation include, but \nare not limited to, the following: \n4.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), \n4.1.2 Specificiation number with grade or class, or both, as \napplicable and year date, \n4.1.3 Manufacture (hot-finished or cold-finished), \n4.1.4 Size (outside diameter and minimum wall thickness), \n4.1.5 Length (specific or random), \n4.1.6 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test \nMethods A1058 when material is ordered to an M suffix (SI \nunits) product standard. If the choice of test track is not \nspecified in the order, then the default ASTM test track shall be \nused as noted in Test Methods A1058. \n4.1.7 Supplementary Requirements, and \n4.1.8 Additional requirements. \n5. Process \n5.1 The steel may be made by any process. \n5.2 If a specific type of melting is required by the purchaser, \nit shall be as stated on the purchase order. \n739 \n5.3 The primary melting may incorporate separate degas\u00ad\nsing or refining and may be followed by secondary melting, \nsuch as electroslag remelting or vacuum-arc remelting. \n5.4 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When \nsteel of different grades is sequentially strand cast, identifica\u00ad\ntion of the resultant transition material is required. The \nproducer shall remove the transition material by an established \nprocedure that positively separates the grades. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 Samples for chemical analysis, and method of analysis \nshall be in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, and \nTerminology A751. \n6.2 Heat Analysis-If the heat analysis reported by the steel \nproducer is not sufficiently complete for conformance with the \nheat analysis requirements of the applicable product specifica\u00ad\ntion to be fully assessed, the manufacturer may complete the \nassessment of conformance with such heat analysis require\u00ad\nments by using a product analysis for the specified elements \nthat were not reported by the steel producer, provided that \nproduct analysis tolerances are not applied and the heat \nanalysis is not altered.
