Scope \nl.l This specification covers nickel-alloy steel plates in\u00ad\ntended primarily for welded pressure vessels. \n1.2 Plates under this specification are available with four \nstrength levels and two nickel compositions as follows: \nGrade Nominal Nickel Yield Strength, min, Tensile Strength, \nContent% ksi [MPa] min, ksi [MPa] \nA 2.25 37 [255] 65 [450] \nB 2.25 40 [275] 70 [485] \nD 3.50 37 [255] 65 [450] \nE 3.50 40 [275] 70 [485] \nF 3.50 \n2 in. [50 mm] and under 55 [380] 80 [550] \nOver 2 in. [50 mm] 50 [345] 75 [515] \n1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the \ncapacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical \nproperty requirements. \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents. Therefore, each system must \nbe nsed independently of the other. Combining values from the \ntwo systems may result in nonconformance with this specifi\u00ad\ncation. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 AS1M Standards: \n262 \nA20/ A20M Specification for General Requirements for Steel \nPlates for Pressure Vessels \nA435/A435M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic \nExamination of Steel Plates \nA577/A577M Specification for Ultrasonic Angle-Beam Ex\u00ad\namination of Steel Plates \nA578/A578M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic \nExamination of Rolled Steel Plates for Special Applica\u00ad\ntions \n3. General Requirements and Ordering Information \n3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall \nconform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out\u00ad\nline the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit\u00ad\nted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of \ndefects, marking, loading, and ordering information. \n3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this \nspecification, certain supplementary requirements are available \nwhen additional control, testing, or examination is required to \nmeet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the \nlisted supplementary requirements in this specification and to \nthe detailed requirements in Specification A20/A20M. \n3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require\u00ad\nments of this specification shall prevail. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and \nshall conform to the fine grain size requirement of Specifica\u00ad\ntion A20/ A20M. \n5. Heat Treatment \n5.1 All plates shall be thermally treated as follows: ",
