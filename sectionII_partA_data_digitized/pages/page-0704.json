Scope \n1.1 This specification covers ductile iron castings for \npressure-retaining parts for use at elevated temperatures. \nCastings of all grades are suitable for use up to 450\u00b0F. For \ntemperatures above 450\u00b0F and up to 650\u00b0F, only Grade \n60-40-18 castings are suitable (Note 1). \n1.2 Valves, flanges, pipe fittings, pumps, and other \npiping components are generally manufactured in advance \nand supplied from stock by the manufacturer, jobber, or \ndealer. \n1.3 For supplemental casting requirements, Specifica\u00ad\ntion A 834 may be utilized. \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \nunits are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the \ntext, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated \nin each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in nonconformance \nto the specification. \nNOTE I - For service other than as specified in this section, reference \nshould be made to Specification A 536 for Ductile Iron Castings. \n2.
