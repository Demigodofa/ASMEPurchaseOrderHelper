Sl. Residual Elements 
S 1.1 Small quantities of certain unspecified elements may 
be present in carbon and low alloy steel forgings. These 
elements are considered as incidental and may be present to the 
following maximum amounts: 
Copper 
Nickel 
Chromium 
Molybdenum 
VanadiumA 
A Unless Supplementary Requirement S2 is required. 
S2. Unspecified Elements 
0.35 % 
0.30 % 
0.25 % 
0.10% 
0.03 % 
S2.1 Vanadium used for grain refinement or deoxidation 
shall not exceed 0.08 %. 
S3. Sequential or Continuous Strand Casting 
S3.1 When multiple heats of the same chemical composi­
tion range are sequentially strand cast, the heats shall be 
separated by an established procedure such that intermix 
material will not be supplied. 
S4. Intercritical Heat Treatment 
S4.1 The austenitizing stage in the heat treatment of ferritic 
forgings is intended to be done at suitable temperatures above 
the upper critical temperature (Ac 3 ) for the heat of steel 
involved, that is, full austenitization. However, when multiple 
austenitizing stages are used the temperature for the last may 
be set between the upper (Ac 3 ) and lower (Ac 1 ) critical 
temperature for partial austenitizing. Such cycles shall be 
followed by tempering within the temperature limits required 
by the material specification. 
SS, Straightening of Forgings 
S5.1 Unless otherwise specified by Supplementary Require­
• ment S6, straightening of forgings after heat treatment for 
• • . properties shall be performed at a temperature which is not 
more than 100°F [55°C] below the final tempering tempera­
. ture. Following straightening, forgings shall be stress relieved 
• at a temperature of 50 to 100°F [30 to 55°C] below the final 
tempering temperature and shall be reported on the material 
. test report. Any straightening performed before heat treatment 
• for properties does not require an intermediate stress-relief heat 
treatment. 
S6. Post-Heat Treatment Straightening of Forgings 
S6.1 Straightening after heat treatment for specified proper­
ties is not permitted without prior approval by the purchaser. 
S7. Fracture Toughness Test 
S7 .1 The purchaser shall specify one or more of the follow­
ing test methods for fracture toughness determination. Re­
quired information including test temperature, conditioning, 
environment, and acceptance criteria shall be provided as 
necessary. 
S7 .2 Determination of the plane strain fracture toughness in 
accordance with Test Method E399. 
S7 .3 Fracture toughness determination in accordance with 
Test Method B1820. 
S7.4 Crack-tip opening displacement determination in ac­
cordance with Test Method B1290. 
SS. Vacuum Degassing 
S8.1 The vacuum degassing requirements of 5.2 shall apply. 
S9. Vacuum Carbon Deoxidation 
S9.1 The molten steel shall be vacuum carbon deoxidized 
(VCD) during processing, in which case the silicon content 
shall be 0.10 % maximum. 
SlO. Restricted Phosphorus and Sulfur, Levels A or B 
S 10.1 For level A, the phosphorus and sulfur levels shall be 
limited as follows: 
Heat Product 
Level A P 0.Q15 % maximum 0.018 % maximum 
S 0.018 % maximum 0.021 % maximum 
Sl0.2 For level B, the phosphorus and sulfur levels shall be 
limited to the following: 
Level B p 
s 
Heat Product 
0.012 % maximum 0.015% maximum 
0.015% maximum 0.Q18 % maximum 
Sll. Restricted Copper, Levels A or B 
S 11.1 For level A, the heat and product analyses limits for 
copper shall be 0.15 % maximum. 
Sll.2 For level B, the heat and product analyses limits for 
copper shall be 0.10 % maximum. 
S12. Tension Specimens for Hobbed Flat Heads and Tube 
Sheets 
Sl2.1 For hubbed tube sheets and flat heads to be used in 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code construction, an axial 
tension specimen shall be taken as close as possible to the hub 
and either inboard or outboard of it, using a sub size specimen 
if necessary. The longitudinal axis of the specimen shall be 
parallel to the length of the hub, as shown in Fig. S12.1. 
S12.2 By agreement with the purchaser, this test orientation 
may replace a specified tension test specimen, provided that 
other location criteria are met. 
S13. Charpy Impact Tests 
Sl3.l Charpy impact tests shall be made. The number, 
orientation and location of the tests shall be specified along 
with the test temperature and the applicable acceptance criteria 
for absorbed energy, fracture appearance, lateral expansion, or 
both. 
S13.2 The specimens shall be machined and tested in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370 or Test 
Methods A1058 in accordance with the purchase order. 
S14. Charpy V Notch Impact Transition Curve 
S 14.1 Sufficient impact tests shall be made from the forging 
material to establish a transition temperature curve based upon 
one or several of the following criteria: 
Sl4.l.1 Absorbed energy (ft•lbf [J]) (See Test Methods E23 
or, if required by the purchase order, Test Methods A1058),
