FIG. 2 Cone-Proof Test 
in. [3 mm] per minute maximum and shall be held for at least 
10 s. The nut shall support its specified cone proof load without 
stripping or rupture. 
11.2.1 Mandrels shall conform to the requirements of 
11.1.1. 
11.2.2 Conical washers shall have a hardness of 57 HRC 
minimum and a hole diameter equivalent to the nominal 
diameter of the mandrel +0.002, -0.000 in. [+0.05 and -0.00 
mm]. 
11.2.3 The contact point of the cone shall be sharp for nut 
sizes ½ in. [12 mm] or less. For sizes over ½ in. [12 mm], the 
point shall be fiat and 0.015 :±: 0.001 in. [0.38 + 0.03 mm] in 
width. 
11.2.4 Cone proof loads may be determined as shown in 
Tables 1 and 2 when they are not specified in the product 
specification. 
12. Impact Requirements 
12.1 The material shall conform to the impact requirements 
prescribed in the product specification. 
12.2 Sampling for impact testing shall conform to the 
product specification. 
12.3 The impact test specimen shall have the form and 
dimensions shown in Fig. 10 of Test Methods and Definitions 
A370 for the Charpy V-notch specimen, Type A when inch­
pound units are specified or to the test specimens described in 
the applicable track of Test Methods A1058 if SI units are 
specified. The longitudinal axis of the specimen shall be 
parallel to the direction of rolling or, in the case of forgings, to 
the longest axis of the component the test bar represents. The 
notch shall be located on the test specimen surface which most 
closely approaches a radial direction. The base of the notch 
shall be as nearly as practicable perpendicular to the longest 
axis of the component. 
13. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
13.1 The bolting components shall conform to the 
dimensions, tolerances and finish as specified in the purchase 
order or in the individual product specification. 
13.2 Bars-Bars shall meet the dimensional requirements of 
Specifications A29/ A29M or A484/ A484M as applicable. 
13.3 Bolts, Screws, Studs, and Stud Bolts-Points shall be 
flat and chamfered or rounded at the option of the manufac­
turer. The length of the point on studs and stud bolts shall be 
not less than one nor more than two complete threads as 
measured from the extreme end parallel to the axis. Length of 
studs and stud bolts shall be measured from first thread to first 
thread. Bolts, studs, and bolting material shall be capable of 
passing inspection in accordance with Specification F788. 
13.3.l Hex Bolts-Unless otherwise specified in the pur­
chase order heads shall be in accordance with the dimensions 
of ASME B18.2.l or B18.2.3.6M and the Heavy Hex screw 
series, should be used, except the maximum body diameter and 
radius of fillets may be the same as for the heavy hex bolt 
series. The body diameter and head fillet radius for sizes of 
heavy hex cap screws and bolts that are not shown in their 
respective tables in the ASME specifications may be that 
shown in the corresponding hex cap screw and bolt tables 
respectively. Unless otherwise specified on the purchase order 
Metric Heavy Hex Screws shall be in accordance with ASME 
Bl8.2.3.3M. 
13.3.2 Socket Heads-Unless otherwise specified socket 
head screws shall be in accordance with ASME Bl8.3 or ISO 
4762. 
13.3.3 Studs and Stud Bolts-Unless otherwise specified in 
the purchase order, dimensions and tolerances for studs and 
stud bolts shall be in accordance with ASME B18.31.2. 
13 .4 External Threads-Threads shall either be formed after 
heat treatment or heat treatment shall be performed in atmo­
sphere control furnaces. 
13.4.1 Thread Form-Unless otherwise specified external 
threads shall be in accordance with ASME Bl.l, Class 2A fit, 
or ASME Bl.13M, Class 6g fit. 
13.4.2 Inch Series-Sizes 1 in. and smaller in diameter shall 
be coarse thread series, and those 11/s in. and larger in diameter 
shall be eight pitch thread series, unless otherwise specified. 
13.5 Nuts-Unless otherwise specified nuts shall be hexago­
nal in shape and the American National Standard Heavy Hex
