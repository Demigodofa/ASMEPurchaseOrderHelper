A Calculated elongation requirements shall be rounded to the nearest whole 
number. 
12.5 Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test-Each 
tube shall be subjected to the hydrostatic, or, instead of this 
test, a nondestructive electric test may be used when specified 
by the purchaser. 
13. Forming Operations 
13.1 When inserted in the boiler, tubes shall stand ex­
panding and beading without showing cracks or flaws. When 
properly manipulated, superheater tubes shall stand all forging, 
welding, and bending operations necessary for application 
without developing defects. 
14. Product Marking 
14.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A450/A450M, the marking shall indicate whether the tube is 
hot-finished or cold-finished. 
14.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 14.1 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. 
15. Keywords

SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
Committee A0l has identified, the location of selected changes to this specification since the last issue, 
A210/A210M-02 (2012), that may impact the use of this specification. (Approved May 1, 2019.) 
(1) Scope was expanded to include grades. 
(2) Hardness values were aligned to match changes in A370 
Sections 16-18 rep01iing of hardness values.
