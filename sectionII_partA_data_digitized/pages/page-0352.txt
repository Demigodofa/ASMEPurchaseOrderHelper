INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Steel Castings, Carbon, Suitable for Fusion Welding, for 
High-Temperature Service 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A216/A216M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Deparnnent of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers carbon steel castings for 
valves, flanges, fittings, or other pressure-containing parts for 
high-temperature service and of quality suitable for assembly 
with other castings or wrought steel parts by fusion welding. 
1.2 Three grades, WCA, WCB, and WCC, are covered in 
this specification. Selection will depend upon design and 
service conditions, mechanical properties, and the high­
temperature characteristics. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the standard. 
1 .4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Conditions for Delivery 
3 .1 Except for investment castings, castings furnished to 
this specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci­
fication A 703/ A 703M, including any supplementary require­
ments that are indicated in the purchase order. Failure to 
comply with the general requirements of Specification A703/ 
A703M constitutes nonconformance with this specification. In 
case of conflict between the requirements of this specification 
and Specification A703/A703M, this specification shall pre­
vail. 
3.2 Steel investment castings furnished to this specification 
shall conform to the requirements of Specification A985/ 
A985M, including any supplementary requirements that are 
indicated in the purchase order. Failure to comply with the 
general requirements of Specification A985/A985M consti­
tutes nonconformance with this specification. In case of con­
flict between the requirements of this specification and Speci­
fication A985/A985M, Specification A985/A985M shall 
prevail. 
4. Ordering Information
