  "text": "SA-814/SA-814M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 \n7.2 Alignment (Camber)-Using a 3-ft [1.0-m] straightedge \nplaced so that both ends are in contact with the pipe, the \ncamber shall not be more than 0.030-in. [0.8-mm]. \n7.3 Thickness-The wall thickness at any point in the pipe \nshall be within the thickness tolerance specified in Table 1, \nexcept that for pipe in which the wall thickness exceeds \n0.188-in. [4.8-mm] a weld reinforcement of up to 0.015-in. \n[0.38-mm] is permitted on the inside of the pipe. \n8. Lengths \n8.1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following \nregular practice. \n8.1.1 Unless otherwise agreed upon, all sizes up to and \nincluding NPS 4 are available in a length up to 24 ft (Note 2) \nwith the permissible range of 15 to 24 ft (Note 2). \nNorn 2-The value(s) applies when the inch-pound designation of this \nspecification is the basis of purchase. When the \"M\" designation of this \nspecification is the basis of purchase, the corresponding metric value(s) \nshall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. \n8.1.2 If definite cut lengths are desired, the lengths required \nshall be specified in the order. No pipe shall be under the \nspecified length and not more than \u00bc in. [6 mm] over that \nspecified. \n8.1.3 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise specified. \n9. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n9.1 The finished pipes shall be free of injurious imperfec\u00ad\ntions and shall have a workmanlike finish. Minor imperfections \nmay be removed by grinding, provided the wall thicknesses are \nnot decreased to less than that permitted in Section 7. \n10. General Requirements \n10.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con\u00ad\nform to the applicable requirements of the current edition of \nSpecification A999/ A999M unless otherwise provided herein. \n11. Examination of Double-Welded Pipe \n11.1 Both ends of each double-welded (Class DW) pipe \nshall be visually examined to determine that complete fusion \nwas attained between the two welds. In lieu of examining the \nends of the pipe, this examination may be performed on \ncropped ends removed from both ends of each double welded \npipe. \n12. Mechanical Tests Required \n12.1 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One tension \ntest shall be made on a specimen for lots of not more than 100 \npipes. Tension tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes \nfor lots of more than 100 pipes. \nNOTE 3-The term \"lot,\" for mechanical tests, applies to all pipe of the \nsame nominal size and wall thickness (or schedule) which is produced \nfrom the same heat of steel and subjected to the same finishing treatment \n(J) in a continuous heat-treatment furnace, or (2) in a batch-type \nheat-treatment furnace, equipped with recording pyrometers and automati\u00ad\ncally controlled within a 50 \u00b0F [30 \u00b0C] range, the larger of (a) Each 200 \nft [60 m] or fraction thereof or, (b) That pipe heat treated in the same batch \nfurnace charge. \n12.2 Flattening Test-For material heat treated in a batch\u00ad\ntype furnace, flattening tests shall be made of 5 % of the pipe \nfrom each heat-treated lot. For material heat treated by the \ncontinuous process, this test shall be made on a sufficient \nnumber of pipe to constitute 5 % of the lot, but in no case less \nthan two lengths of pipe. \n12.2.1 For pipe where the diameter equals or exceeds NPS \n10, a transverse-guided face bend test of the weld may be \nconducted instead of a flattening test in accordance with the \nmethod outlined in the steel tubular product supplement of Test \nMethods and Definitions A370. The ductility of the weld shall \nbe considered acceptable when there is no evidence of cracks \nin the weld or between the weld and the base metal after \nbending. Test specimens from 5 % of the lot shall be taken \nfrom the pipe or test plates of the same material as the pipe, the \ntest plates being attached to the end of the cylinder and welded \nas a prolongation of the pipe longitudinal seam. \n12.3 Hydrostatic Test-Each length of pipe shall be sub\u00ad\njected to the hydrostatic test in accordance with Specification \nA999/ A999M. \n13. Product Marking \n13.1 In addition to the marking specified in Specification \nA999/ A999M, the marking shall include the manufacturer's \nidentifying mark and double-welded pipe shall be identified \nwith the mark (DW). For Grades TP304H, TP316H, TP321H, \nTP347H, TP348H, and S30815, the marking shall also include \nthe heat number and heat-treatment lot identification. If speci\u00ad\nfied in the purchase order, the marking for pipe larger than NPS \n4 shall include the weight. \n14. Keywords \n14.1 austenitic stainless steel pipe; cold-worked pipe \n1328 \n. ~ ",
