Fig. 5 shows specimens with various types of ends \nthat have given satisfactory results. \n13. Gauge Marks \n13.1 The specimens shown in Figs. 3-6 shall be gauge \nmarked with a center punch, scribe marks, multiple device, or \ndrawn with ink. The purpose of these gauge marks is to \ndetermine the percent elongation. Punch marks shall be light, \nsharp, and accurately spaced. The localization of stress at the \nmarks makes a hard specimen susceptible to starting fracture at \nthe punch marks. The gauge marks for measuring elongation \nafter fracture shall be made on the flat or on the edge of the flat \ntension test specimen and within the parallel section; for the \n8-in. gauge length specimen, Fig. 3, one or more sets of 8-in. \ngauge marks may be used, intermediate marks within the gauge \nlength being optional. Rectangular 2-in. gauge length \nspecimens, Fig. 3, and round specimens, Fig. 4, are gauge \nmarked with a double-pointed center punch or scribe marks. \nOne or more sets of gauge marks may be used; however, one \n592 \nset must be approximately centered in the reduced section. \nThese same precautions shall be observed when the test \nspecimen is full section. \n14. Determination of Tensile Properties \n14.1 Yield Point-Yield point is the first stress in a material, \nless than the maximum obtainable stress, at which an increase \nin strain occurs without an increase in stress. Yield point is \nintended for application only for materials that may exhibit the \nunique characteristic of showing an increase in strain without \nan increase in stress. The stress-strain diagram is characterized \nby a sharp knee or discontinuity. Determine yield point by one \nof the following methods: \n14.1.1 Drop of Beam or Halt of Pointer Method-In this \nmethod, apply an increasing load to the specimen at a uniform \nrate. When a lever and poise machine is used, keep the beam in \nbalance by running out the poise at approximately a steady \nrate. When the yield point of the material is reached, the \nincrease of the load will stop, but nm the poise a trifle beyond \nthe balance position, and the beam of the machine will drop for \na brief but appreciable interval of time. When a machine \nequipped with a load-indicating dial is used there is a halt or \nhesitation of the load-indicating pointer corresponding to the ",
