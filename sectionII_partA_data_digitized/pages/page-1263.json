A linear indication is defined as one \nwhose length is three times its width. \n7 .2.1.2 Rounded indications with dimensions greater than \n1/s in. [3.2 mm] for thicknesses less than 5/s in. [16 mm], and \ngreater than 3 /16 in. [4.8 mm] for thicknesses 5/s in. [16 mm] and \ngreater. \n7.2.1.3 Four or more relevant indications in a line separated \nby 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] or less, edge to edge. \n7.2.1.4 Ten or more relevant indications in any 6 in.2 [3870 \nmm 2 ] of surface with the major dimension of this area not to \nexceed 6 in. [150 mm] when it is taken in the most unfavorable \norientation relative to the indications being evaluated. \n8. Rework and Retreatment \n8.1 Repair welding shall not be permitted. For retreatment, \nsee 7.2.1. \n9. Certification and Reports \n9.1 In addition to the certification requirements of Specifi\u00ad\ncation A788/A788M, the manufacturer shall include the fol\u00ad\nlowing in the certification data: \n9 .1.1 Results of the product analysis, \n9.1.2 Method used to locate mechanical test specimens (see \nSection 6), and \n9.1.3 Sketches or drawings as necessary to supplement the \nnondestructive examination report. \n10. Packaging and Package Marking \n10.1 Marking shall be in accordance with Specification \nA788/A788M but stamping shall be permitted only in areas \ndesignated by the purchaser. If no such suitable area is \navailable, a separate nameplate, with the required stamping, \nshall be permanently affixed to the vessel in a manner that will \nnot be injurious to the vessel. \n11. Keywords \n11.1 alloy steel forgings; high pressure vessels; high \nstrength; impact tested; isostatic presses; nonweldable; \nquenched and tempered; vacuum-treated steel \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nOne or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the \npurchaser in the inquiry or order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be agreed upon \nby the manufacturer and the purchaser. \nSl. Charpy V-Notch Impact Transition Curve \nS 1.1 Sufficient impact tests shall be made from the forging \ntest material to establish a temperature-absorbed energy curve. \nThe test temperature range shall be wide enough to establish \nthe upper and lower shelf foot-pound-force energies, with \nsufficient testing at intermediate temperatures to permit plot\u00ad\nting a reasonably smooth curve. \nS 1.2 Instead of plotting an impact transition curve, impact \nrequirements may be specified as 50 % fibrous fracture at a \nspecified maximum temperature. \nS2. Additional Charpy Data \nS2.1 The percent shear fracture and mils of lateral \nexpansion, defined in Test Methods and Definitions A370, shall \nbe reported for each Charpy specimen tested. \nS3. Charpy Impact Tests \nS3.l Charpy impact tests shall be made in accordance with \nthe provisions of Section 6 of this specification, except that the \ntests shall be at a specified temperature lower than 40\u00b0F \n[4.5\u00b0C]. These tests shall be instead of those specified in \nSection 6, and shall meet the requirements of Table 3. \nS4. Impact Testing \nS4.1 For Class 2a forgings, impact tests shall be made in \naccordance with the provisions of Section 6 of this specifica\u00ad\ntion except that the acceptance criteria shall be a minimum of \n45 ft-lbf [61 J] and 25 mils [0.635 mm] lateral expansion at a \ntest temperature specified by the purchaser. \nSS. Mechanical Test Location Discard \nS5.1 Instead of the discard of\u00bc T x 2 /2 T required by 6.2.3, \na minimum discard of \u00bc T x T shall be employed for Method \n3. \nS6. Alternate Mechanical Testing \nS6; 1 Forgings exeeding 5000 lb [2270kg] at the time of heat \ntreatment, and not over 80 in. [2030 mm] in length, excluding \ntest material, require one set of test specimens to be taken from \neach end of the forging. Each test specimen set shall consist of \none tension test and three Charpy V-notch specimens. The test \nspecimen set locations shall be spaced 180\u00b0 apart, end to end. \nWhen the forging length exceeds 80 in. [2030 mm] excluding \ntest material two sets of mechanical test specimens shall be \nremoved from each end of the forging, and spaced 180\u00b0 apart \nat the same end, and rotated 90\u00b0 end to end. \n1179 ",
