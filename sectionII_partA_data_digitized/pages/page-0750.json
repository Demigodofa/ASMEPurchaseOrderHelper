Scope \n1.1 This specification covers wrought carbon steel and \nalloy steel fittings of seamless and welded construction, cov\u00ad\nered by the latest revision of ASME B16.9, ASME B16.11, \nMSS SP-79, MSS SP-83, MSS SP-95, and MSS SP-97. \nFittings differing from these ASME and MSS standards shall \nbe furnished in accordance with Supplementary Requirement \nS58 of Specification A960/A960M. These fittings are for use in \npressure piping and pressure vessel service at low tempera\u00ad\ntures. \n1.2 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for \nfittings where a greater degree of examination is desired. When \ndesired, one or more of these supplementary requirements shall \nbe specified in the order. \n1.3 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units \nand in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the \napplicable \"M\" specification designation (SI units), the mate\u00ad\nrial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n700 \n2.
