The test method for straightness measurement is \nat the manufacturer's option, unless a specific test method is \nspecified in the purchase order. \n10. Tubing Sections Other Than Square and Rectangular \n10.1 In addition to square and rectangular tubing, many \nproducers supply a variety of special sections, such as oval, \nstreamlined, hexagonal, octagonal, round inside and hexagonal \nor octagonal outside, ribbed inside or out, triangular, rounded \nrectangular and D shapes. Manufacturing practices limit the \nsize range and section available from the various producers. \nThese special sections may be made through turkshead rolls or \nthrough a die with or without use of a mandrel. Since the \nsections are special, dies and other tools are not held available. \nTherefore, when inquiring for shapes other than square and \nrectangular, it is essential to give full details as to dimensions \nand finish. \n11. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n851 \n11.1 The tubing shall be free of injurious defects and shall \nhave a workmanlike finish. \n~ ",
