SA-530/SA-530M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
During the second step, which is a test for soundness, the 
flattening shall be continued untii' the specimen breaks or the 
opposite walls of the pipe meet. 
21.2 Welded Pipe-A section of welded pipe not less than 4 
in. [100 mm] in length shall be flattened cold between parallel 
plates in two steps. The weld shall be placed 90° from the 
direction of the applied force (at the point of maximum 
bending). During the first step, which is a test for ductility, no 
cracks or breaks on the inside or outside surfaces, except as 
provided for in 21.3.4, shall occur until the distance between 
the plates is less than the value of H calculated by Eq 2. During 
the second step, which is a test for soundness, the flattening 
shall be continued until the specimen breaks or the opposite 
walls of the pipe meet. 
21.3 Seamless, Centrifugally Cast, and Welded Pipe: 
21.3.1 Evidence of laminated or defective material or weld 
that is revealed during the entire flattening test shall be cause 
for rejection. 
21.3.2 Surface imperfections not evident in the test speci­
men before flattening, but revealed during the first step of the 
flattening test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish 
requirements. 
21.3.3 Superficial ruptures resulting from surface imperfec­
tions shall not be a cause for rejection. 
21.3.4 When low D-to-t ratio tubular products are tested, 
because the strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably 
high on the inside surface at the six and twelve o'clock 
locations, cracks at these locations shall not be cause for 
rejection if the D to t ratio is less than 10. 
22. Hydrostatic Test Requirements 
22.1 Except as provided in 22.2 and 22.3, each length of 
pipe shall be tested by the manufacturer to a hydrostatic 
pressure which will produce in the pipe wall a stress not less 
than 60 % of the minimum specified yield strength for carbon 
and ferritic alloy steel pipe, or 50 % of the specified minimum 
yield strength for austenitic alloy steel pipe. The test pressure 
or stress shall be determined by the following equation: 
P = 2St/D or S = PD/2t (3) 
22.2 Regardless of pipe-wall stress-level determined by Eq 
3, the minimum hydrostatic test pressure required to satisfy 
these requirements need not exceed 2500 psi [17.0 MPa] for 
outside diameters (see Din 22.1) of 3.5 in. [88.9 mm] or less, 
nor 2800 psi [19.0 MPa] for outside diameters over 3.5 in. 
[88.9 mm]. This does not prohibit testing at higher pressures at 
the manufacturer's option or as provided in 22.3. 
22.3 With concurrence of the manufacturer, a minimum 
hydrostatic test pressure in excess of the requirements of 22.2 
or 22.1, or both, may be stated on the order. 
22.4 The test pressure shall be held for a minimum of 5 s, 
without resultant leakage through the pipe wall. For welded 
pipe, the test pressure shall be held for a time sufficient to 
permit the inspector to examine the entire length of the welded 
seam. 
22.5 The hydrostatic test may not be capable of inspecting 
the end portion of the pipe. The length of pipe that cannot be 
tested shall be determined by the manufacturer and, when 
specified in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
23. Material Test Report 
23.1 The producer or supplier shall furnish a material test 
report certifying that the material was manufactured, sampled, 
tested and inspected in accordance with the specification, 
including year date, the supplementary requirements, and any 
other requirements designated in the purchase order or 
contract, and that the results met the requirements of that 
specification, the supplementary requirements and the other 
requirements. A signature or notarization is not required on the 
material test report, but the document shall be dated and shall 
clearly identify the organization submitting the report. Not­
withstanding the absence of a signature or notarization, the 
organization submitting the report is responsible for the con­
tents of the report. 
23.2 In addition, the material test report shall include the 
following information and test results, when applicable: 
23.2.1 Heat Number, 
23.2.2 Heat Analysis, 
23.2.3 Product Analysis, if specified or required, where: -------=-=--------------------------';ttL. ~sile-Properties,
