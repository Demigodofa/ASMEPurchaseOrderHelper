the specimen shall be concentric with the axis of the bolt; the 
head and threaded section of the bolt may be left intact, as in 
Fig. A3.3 and Fig. A3.4, or shaped to fit the holders or grips of 
the testing machine so that the load is applied axially. The 
gauge length for measuring the elongation shall be four times 
the diameter of the specimen.

(2) For bolts 1½ in. and over in nominal diameter, a 
standard ½-in. round 2-in. gauge length test specimen shall be 
turned from the bolt, having its axis midway between the 
center and outside surface of the body of the bolt as shown in 
Fig. A3.5. 
( 3) Machined specimens are to be tested in tension to 
determine the properties prescribed by the product specifica­
tions. The methods of testing and determination of properties 
shall be in accordance with Section 14 of these test methods. 
A3.3 Hardness Tests for Externally Threaded Fasteners 
A3.3.1 When specified, externally threaded fasteners shall 
be hardness tested. Fasteners with hexagonal or square heads 
shall be Brinell or Rockwell hardness tested. For hexagonal 
and square head bolts, test shall be conducted on the wrench 
flats, top of head, unthreaded shank, end of bolt or at the 
arbitration location. For studs, products without parallel
