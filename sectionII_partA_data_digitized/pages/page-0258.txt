SA-181/SA-181M ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR CARBON STEEL FORGINGS, FOR 
GENERAL-PURPOSE PIPING 
SA-181/SA-lSlM cO 
INTERNATIONAL 
Standards Worldwide 
(Identical with ASTM Specification A 181/A 181M-06) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers nonstandard as-forged :fit­
tings, valve components, and parts for general service. 
Forgings made to this specification are limited to a maxi­
mum weight of 10 000 lb [ 4540 kg]. Larger forgings may 
be ordered to Specification A 266/ A 266M. 
1.2 Two classes of material are covered, designated 
as Classes 60 and 70, respectively, and are classified in 
accordance with their mechanical properties as specified 
in 6.1. 
1.3 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound 
units and SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the 
material shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification.

3. General Requirements and Ordering 
Information 
3.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform 
to the requirements of Specification A 961/ A 96 lM, 
206 
including any supplementary requirements that are indi­
cated in the purchase order. Failure to comply with the 
requirements of Specification A 961 / A 961 M constitutes 
non-conformance with this specification. 
3.2 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in 
the purchase order all ordering information necessary to 
purchase the needed material. Examples of such informa­
tion include but are not limited to the ordering information 
in Specification A 961/ A 96 lM and the following: 
3.2.1 Supplementary requirements, and 
3.2.2 Additional requirements (See 4.3, 9.1, 10.2, 
12.1, and 12.2). 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in con­
flict with the requirements of Specification A 961 / A 961M, 
the requirements of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Except for flanges of all types, hollow, cylindrically 
shaped parts may be machined from hot-rolled or forged 
bar, provided that the axial length of the part is approxi­
mately parallel to the metal flow lines of the stock. Other 
parts, excluding flanges of all types, up to and including 
NPS 4 may be machined from hot-rolled or forged bar. 
Elbows, return bends, tees, and header tees shall not be 
machined directly from bar stock. 
4.2 Except as permitted in 4.1, the finished product 
shall be a forging as defined in the Terminology section 
(exclusively) of Specification A 788/ A 788M. 
4.3 When specified in the order, the manufacturer shall 
submit for approval of the purchaser a sketch showing the 
shape of the rough forging before machining. 
4.4 Forgings shall be protected against sudden or too 
rapid cooling from the rolling or forging while passing 
through the critical range.
