4.1.8 Copper bearing steel, if required (6.3), 
4.1.9 Test report (Section 10), 
4.1.10 Supplementary Requirements or special 
requirements if required, and 
4.1.11 Application and processing. 
NOTE 2-A typical ordering description is as follows: 10 000 lb, [5000 
kg] Hot Wrought Special Quality Carbon Steel Bars, 1 in. diameter X 
10 ft, [25 m x 3 m] Round, AS1M A 675/ A 675M dated __ , Grade 
50, [345] Copper Bearing, Test Report Required, S3 Special Straightness, 
Boiler Supports. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Melting Practice - The steel shall be made by one 
or more of the following primary processes: open-hearth, 
basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace. The primary melting 
may incorporate separate degassing or refining and may 
be followed by secondary melting using electroslag remelt­
ing or vacuum-arc remelting. Where secondary melting is 
employed, the heat shall be defined as all of the ingots 
remelted from a single primary heat. 
5.2 Deoxidation: 
5.2.1 Unless otherwise specified, the steel shall be 
rimmed, capped, semi-killed, or killed at the producer's 
option. 
5.2.2 When required, the purchaser may specify the 
required deoxidation practice, dependent upon strength 
grade specified, purchaser's methods of fabrication, and 
end use requirements. Killed steels can be produced to 
coarse or fine austenitic grain size ( Supplementary Require­
ment Sl). 
5.3 Condition - Unless otherwise specified, the bars 
shall be furnished as-rolled and not pickled, blast cleaned, 
or oiled. At the producer's option, bars may be cleaned 
for inspection. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical require­
ments specified in Table 2. 
6.2 Leaded Steel - When required, lead may be speci­
fied as an added element. When lead is specified as an 
added element, a range from 0.15 to 0.35 % inclusive shall 
be furnished. Such a steel is identified by adding the letter 
L after the grade designation, for example 60L [415L]. 
6.3 Copper-Bearing Steel - When required copper may 
be specified as an added element. Copper-bearing steel is 
identified by stating "copper-bearing" on the purchase 
order. 
6.4 When tension tests are waived in accordance with 
7 .1.1.2, chemistry consistent with the mechanical proper­
ties desired shall be applied. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Tension Tests 
7.1.1 Requirements: 
7.1.1.1 The material as represented by the test 
specimen shall conform to the applicable requirements in 
Table 1. 
7.1.1.2 Shapes less than 1 in. 2 [645 mm 2 ] in cross 
section and bars (other than flats) less than½ in. [12.5 mm] 
in thickness or diameter need not be subject to tension 
tests by the manufacturer. 
7.1.1.3 For material over¾ in. [19 mm] in thick­
ness or diameter, a deduction of 0.25% from the percentage 
of elongation in 8 in. [200 mm] specified in Table 1 shall 
be made for each increase of ½ 2 in. [0.8 mm] in the specified 
thickness or diameter above¾ in. [19 mm]. 
7.1.1.4 For material under 1fo in. [8 mm] in thick­
ness or diameter, a deduction of 2.00% from the percentage 
of elongation in 8 in. [200 mm] specified in Table 1 shall be 
made for each decrease of ½ 2 in. [0.8 mm] in the specified 
thickness or diameter below 3/i 6 in. [8 mm]. 
7.1.1.5 For Grades 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 [310, 
345, 380, and 415) for material over 2 in. [50 mm] in 
thickness or diameter, a deduction of 1.00% from the per­
centage of elongation in 2 in. [50 mm] specified in Table 1 
shall be made for each 1 in. [25 mm] of specified thickness 
or diameter or fraction thereof over 2 in. [50 mm] in 
thickness or diameter. 
7.1.1.6 For Grades 70, 75, 80, and 90 [485, 515, 
550 and 620] for material over 2 in. [50 mm] in thickness 
or diameter, a deduction of 1.00% from the percentage of 
elongation in 2 in. [50 mm] specified in Table 1 shall be 
made for each 1 in. [25 mm] of specified thickness or 
diameter, or fraction thereof, over 2 in. [50 mm] in diameter 
or thickness, to a maximum deduction of 3%. 
7.1.2 Test Specimens: 
7.1.2.1 Test specimens shall be prepared for test­
ing from the material in its as-rolled condition unless other­
wise specified (see Supplementary Requirements). The 
tension specimen may be aged as described in Test Meth­
ods and Definitions A 370. 
7.1.2.2 Test specimens shall be taken longitudi­
nally and may be tested in full thickness or section, or they 
may be machined to the dimensions shown in Fig. 4 or 
Fig. 5 of Test Methods and Definitions A 370. If test speci­
mens are selected conforming to the dimensions of Fig. 5, 
they shall be machined from a position midway between 
the center and the surface of the bar. 
7.1.2.3 Test specimens for shapes and flats may 
be machined to the form and dimensions shown in Fig. 4 
of Test Methods and Definitions A 370 or with both edges 
parallel. Test specimens for material over 1½ in. [40 mm]
