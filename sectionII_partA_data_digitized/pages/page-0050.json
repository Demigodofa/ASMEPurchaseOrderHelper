In addition, specifications ori\u00ad\nginating with ASTM that are new or revised in this 2025 edition are formatted differently than those retained from the \n2023 and earlier editions. The document following the cover sheet of each new or revised specification is the unedited \nASTM specification. The ASME title for the specification and any ASME-approved exceptions to the ASTM specification \nare shown only on the cover sheet. Specifications affected by the new format are listed in the Summary of Changes. \nChanges listed below are identified on the pages by a margin note, (25), placed next to the affected area. \nPage \nxi \nxii \nxv \nxl \nxlix \n1 \n185 \n195 \n211 \n265 \n273 \n277 \n299 \n305 \n327 \n423 \n451 \nsos \n517 \n527 \n575 \n785 \n845 \n943 \n977 \nLocation \nList of Sections \nForeword \nPersonnel \nPreface \nSpecifications Listed by \nMaterials \nSpecification Removal \nStatement of Policy on the \nUse of ASME Material \nSpecifications \nSA-135/SA-135M \nSA-178/SA-178M \nSA-182/SA-182M \nSA-204/SA-204M \nSA-210/SA-210M \nSA-213/SA-213M \nSA-216/SA-216M \nSA-217 /SA-217M \nSA-234/SA-234M \nSA-283/SA-283M \nSA-312/SA-312M \nSA-335/SA-335M \nSA-336/SA-336M \nSA-350 /SA-350M \nSA-369 /SA-369M \nSA-480 /SA-480M \nSA-513/SA-513M \nSA-556/SA-556M \nSA-568/SA-568M \nChange \nTitle of Section XI, Division 1 revised \nUpdated \nUpdated \nTwelfth paragraph revised \nUpdated \nUpdated \nRevised \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nOn cover sheet, Specification date changed from '18' to '17' by errata \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety \nRevised in its entirety ",
