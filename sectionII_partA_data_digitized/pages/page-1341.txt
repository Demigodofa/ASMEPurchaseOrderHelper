14.3 Mill inspection by the purchaser shall not interfere 
unnecessarily with the manufacturer's operations. 
15. Rejection 
15.1 Any rejection based on the presence of an injurious 
defect found subsequent to acceptance at the manufacturer's 
works or based on the results of a product analysis made in 
accordance with 8.4 shall be reported to the manufacturer. 
15 .2 Disposition of forgings rejected by the purchaser under 
15.1 shall be as agreed upon between manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
16. Certification 
16.1 The manufacturer shall furnish to the purchaser the 
number of copies of the material test report specified in the 
ordering information (4.1.4). The following items shall be 
reported: 
16.1.1 Purchase order number, 
16.1.2 Forging identification number, 
16.1.3 The product specification number, including the year 
date and revision letter if any, as well as the appropriate class, 
type, and grade, 
16.1.3.1 Reference to Specification A788/A788M including 
the year date together with the applicable revision letter, if any, 
of the revision used shall be a part of the certification. 
16.1.4 Heat number and analysis, 
16.1.5 Results of the required acceptance tests for mechani­
cal properties, 
16.1.6 Results of any required nondestructive examinations, 
16.1.7 Final heat treatment cycle including austenitizing 
and tempering temperatures and holding times and cooling 
methods if required by the product specification or 4.2.3, 
16.1.8 Extent to which the forging is incomplete with 
respect to the product specification (see 1.4 and 16.1.7), and 
16.1.9 Results of any supplementary and additional test 
requirements that were specified. 
16.1.10 The material test report may be sent to the purchaser 
in electronic form from an electronic data interchange (EDI) 
transmission, and this shall be regarded as having the same 
validity as a counterpart printed in the certifier's facility. The 
content of the EDI transmitted document shall meet the 
requirements of the invokedASTM standard(s) and conform to 
any existing EDI agreement between the purchaser and the 
supplier. Notwithstanding the absence of a signature, the 
organization submitting the EDI transmission is responsible for 
the content of the report. 
17. Packaging and Package Marking 
17 .1 Each forging shall be legibly identified as required by 
the product specification and instructions from the purchaser. 
When not otherwise defined, each forging shall be identified by 
the manufacturer as follows: 
17 .1.1 Manufacturer's name or symbol. 
17 .1.2 Manufacturer's identification or heat number. 
17 .1.3 Product specification number. 
17 .1.4 The class, grade, and type identification as appropri-
ate. 
17.1.5 Purchaser's identification (4.2.3). 
17.1.6 Location of stamping (4.2.3). 
17.1.7 Incomplete forging (1.4). The marking shall include 
the suffix Y immediately following the ASTM number, and 
preceding any other suffix. This suffix shall not be removed 
until the material specification requirements have been com­
pleted and the material test report supplemented. 
17 .2 Marking shall be done by impression stamping or other 
acceptable means specified in the product specification or 
order. Bar coding is an acceptable supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. The bar coding system, if applied at 
the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one of 
published industry standards for bar coding. 
17.3 The specification year date, and revision letter are not 
required to be marked on the forgings. 
18. Keywords 
18.1 general delivery requirements; steel forgings-alloy; 
steel forgings-carbon 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
(GENERAL) 
The following supplementary general requirements are common to the forging specifications listed 
in this specification. These and other limitations or tests may be performed by agreement between the 
supplier and purchaser. The additional requirements shall be specified in the order, and shall be 
completed by the supplier before the shipment of the forgings.
