3.3.1 Vacuum treatment, 
3.3.2 Additional or special tension testing, 
3.3.3 Additional or special impact testing, and 
3.3.4 Nondestructive examination. 
3.4 The purchaser is referred to the listed supplementary 
requirements in this specification and to the detailed require­
ments in Specification A20/A20M. 
3.5 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and 
shall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of 
Specification A20/ A20M. 
4.2 The plates shall be produced by the thermo-mechanical 
control process. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 The chemical composition on heat analysis shall con­
form to the requirements given in Table 1, except as otherwise 
provided in Supplementary Requirement S 17 of Specification 
A20/ A20M when that requirement is involved. 
5.2 If a product analysis is made on a sample taken from the 
standard location (see Specification A20/A20M), the results of 
the analysis shall not deviate from the limits for the heat 
analysis by more than the values given in Table 2. 
6. Mechanical Requirements 
6.1 If the plates are to be subjected to warm forming or 
post-weld heat treatment, the test coupons shall be subjected to 
heat treatment to simulate such fabrication operations. (See 
3.2.1 and Specification A20/ A20M, Supplementary Require­
ment S3.) 
6.2 Tension Test Requirements-The plates as represented 
by the tension-test specimens shall conform to the require­
ments given in Table 3. 
6.2.1 Number and Location of Test Coupons-Two tension 
tests shall be made from each plate-as-rolled. One test coupon 
shall be taken from a comer of the plate on each end. 
6.3 Notch Toughness Test Requirements: 
6.3.1 Except for Grade G, longitudinal Charpy V-notch tests 
shall be made in accordance with Specification A20/A20M. 
6.3.2 For Grades A, B and C, unless the test temperature and 
absorbed energy requirements are specified in the purchase 
order, the tests shall be conducted at -40°F [-40°C] and the 
average absorbed energy for each set of three full size 
specimens shall be 15 ft-lb [20J] or more. 
6.3.3 For Grade D, unless the test temperature and the 
lateral expansion requirements are specified in the purchase 
order, the tests shall be conducted at -40°F [-40°C] and the 
lateral expansion for each specimen shall be 0.015 in. [0.4 mm] 
or more. 
6.3.4 For Grades E and F, unless the test temperature and 
absorbed energy requirements are specified in the purchase 
order, the tests shall be conducted at -40°F [-40°C] and the 
average absorbed energy for each set of three full size 
specimens shall be 20 ft·lb [27 J] or more. 
6.3.5 For Grade G, transverse Charpy V-notch tests shall be 
made in accordance with Specification A20/A20M. Unless the 
test temperature is specified in the purchase order, the tests 
shall be conducted at -320°F [-195°C]. Each specimen shall 
have a lateral expansion opposite the notch of not less than 
0.D15 in. [0.38 mm], up to a plate thickness of 1.25 in. [31.75 
mm] inclusive; and 0.019 in. [0.48 mm] at a plate thickness of 
2.0 in. [50 mm]. Values of lateral expansion for plate thick­
nesses between 1.25 in. [31.75 mm] and 2.0 in. [50 mm] shall 
be determined by linear interpolation. 
7. Marking 
7 .1 In addition to the marking required in Specification 
A20/ A20M, each plate shall be legibly stamped with the letters 
"TMC" following the stamped specification designation. 
8. Keywords 
8.1 pressure containing parts; pressure vessel steel; steel 
plates; steel plates for pressure vessel applications
