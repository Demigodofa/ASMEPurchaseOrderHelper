A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers several grades of carbon and \nlow-alloy steel forged or ring-rolled flanges, forged fittings and \nvalves intended primarily for low-temperature service and \nrequiring notch toughness testing. They are made to specified \ndimensions, or to dimensional standards, such as the ASME \nand API Specifications referenced in Section 2. Although this \nspecification covers some piping components machined from \nrolled bar and seamless tubular materials (see 5.3.3), it does not \ncover raw material produced in these product forms. \n1.2 No limitation on size is intended beyond the ability of \nthe manufacturer to obtain the specified requirements. \nHowever, Class 3 of Grade LF787 is only available in the \nquenched-and-precipitation heat treated condition. \n1.3 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when \nadditional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply \nonly when specified by the purchaser in the order. \n1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units \nand in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the \napplicable \"M\" specification designation (SI units), the mate\u00ad\nrial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. \n1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. \n1.6 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nAOl.22 on Steel Forgings and Wrought Fittings for Piping Applications and Bolting \nMaterials for Piping and Special Purpose Applications. \nCurrent edition approved May I, 2023.
