Scope \n1.1 This specification covers carbon steel pipe made by the \ncentrifugal casting process intended for use in high\u00ad\ntemperature, high-pressure service. Pipe ordered under this \nspecification shall be suitable for fusion welding, bending, and \nother forming operations. \n1.2 Several grades of carbon steels are covered. Their \ncompositions are given in Table 1. \n1.3 Supplementary requirements (Sl to S9) of an optional \nnature are provided. The supplementary requirements call for \nadditional tests to be made, and when desired shall be so stated \nin the order, together with the number of such tests required. \n1.4 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded \nas the standard. \n2.
