At = 
minimum wedge tensile load without fracture, 
tensile strength specified in ksi or MPa in Tables 2 and 
3, and 
stress area of the thread section, square inches or square 
millimetres, as shown in the Cone Proof Load Tables in 
Specification A962/A962M. 
9.2 Hardness Requirements: 
9.2.1 The hardness shall conform to the requirements pre­
scribed in Tables 2 and 3. Hardness testing shall be performed 
in accordance with either Specification A962/ A962M or with 
Test Methods F606/F606M. 
9.2.2 Grade B7M-The maximum hardness of the grade 
shall be 235 HBW or 99 HRB. The minimum hardness shall 
not be less than 200 HBW or 93 HRB. Conformance to this 
hardness shall be ensured by testing the hardness of each stud 
or bolt by Brinell or Rockwell B methods in accordance with 
9 .2.1. The use of 100 % electromagnetic testing for hardness as 
an alternative to 100 % indentation hardness testing is permis­
sible when qualified by sampling using indentation hardness 
testing. Each lot tested for hardness electromagnetically shall 
be 100 % examined in accordance with Practice E566. Follow­
ing electromagnetic testing for hardness, a random sample of a 
minimum of 100 pieces of each heat of steel in each lot (as 
defined in 12.1.1) shall be tested by indentation hardness 
methods. All samples must meet hardness requirements to 
permit acceptance of the lot. If any one sample is outside of the 
specified maximum or minimum hardness, the lot shall be 
rejected and either reprocessed and resampled or tested 100 % 
by indentation hardness methods. 
9.2.2.l Surface preparation for indentation hardness testing 
shall be in accordance with Test Methods E18. Hardness tests 
shall be performed on the end of the bolt or stud. When this is 
impractical, the hardness test shall be performed elsewhere. 
10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
10.1 Bolts, screws, studs, and stud bolts shall be pointed and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. Points shall be flat and 
chamfered or rounded at option of the manufacturer. Length of 
point on studs and stud bolts shall be not less than one nor more 
than two complete threads as measured from the extreme end 
parallel to the axis. Length of studs and stud bolts shall be 
measured from first thread to first thread. 
10.2 Unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, bolt 
heads shall be in accordance with the dimensions of ASME 
Bl8.2.1 or ASME B18.2.3.3M. Unless otherwise specified in 
the purchase order, the Heavy Hex Screws Series should be 
used for nominal body diameters of l ¼ in. [30 mm] and less. 
For larger sizes, the Heavy Hex Screw Series should be used, 
except the maximum body diameter and radius of fillet may be 
the same as for the Heavy Hex Bolt Series. The body diameter 
and head fillet radius for sizes of Heavy Hex Cap Screws and 
Bolts that are not shown in their respective tables in ASME 
B18.2.l or ASME B18.2.3.3M may be that shown in the 
corresponding Hex Cap Screw and Bolt Tables respectively. 
Socket head screws or bolts shall be in accordance with ASME 
B18.3 or ASME B18.3.1M. 
11. Retests 
11.1 If the results of the mechanical tests of any test lot do 
not conform to the requirements specified, the manufacturer 
may retreat such lot not more than twice, in which case two 
additional tension tests shall be made from such lot, all of 
which shall conform to the requirements specified. 
12. Test Specimens 
12.1 Number of Tests-For heat-treated bars, one tension 
test shall be made for each diameter of each heat represented in 
each tempering charge. When heat treated without interruption 
in continuous furnaces, the material in a lot shall be the same 
heat, same prior condition, same size, and subjected to the 
same heat treatment. Not fewer than two tension tests are 
required for each lot containing 20 000 lb [9000 kg] or less. 
Every additional 10 000 lb [4500 kg] or fraction thereof 
requires one additional test. 
12. l.1 For studs, bolts, screws, and so forth, one tension test 
shall be made for each diameter of each heat involved in the 
lot. Each lot shall consist of the following: 
Diameter, in. [mm] 
11/s [30] and under 
Over 11/s (30] to 1¾ (42], incl 
Over 1¾ (42] to 2½ (64], incl 
Over 2½ (64] 
Lot Size 
1500 lb (680 kg] or fraction thereof 
4500 lb [2000 kg] or fraction thereof 
6000 lb [2700 kg] or fraction thereof 
100 pieces or fraction thereof 
12.1.2 Tension tests are not required to be made on bolts, 
screws, studs, or stud bolts that are fabricated from heat-treated 
bars furnished in accordance with the requirements of this 
specification and tested in accordance with 12.1, provided they 
are not given a subsequent heat treatment.

12.1.3 Full Size Specimens, Headed Bolting COmponents­
Headed bolts or screws 1 ½ in. in body diameter and smaller, 
with body length three times the diameter or longer, and that 
are produced by upsetting or forging (hot or cold) shall be 
subjected to full size testing in accordance with 9.1.2. This 
testing shall be in addition to tensile testing as specified in 
9.1.1. Wedge tensile testing shall be limited to product with 
socket head cap screw, hexagon, square, hex flange, or twelve 
point flange heads. The lot size shall be as shown in 12.1.1. 
Failure shall occur in the body or threaded section with no 
failure, or indications of failure, such as cracks, at the junction 
of the head and shank. Wedge tensile testing is not required for 
flat countersunk head or socket button products. 
13. Nuts 
13.1 Bolts, studs, and stud bolts shall be furnished with 
nuts, when specified in the purchase order. Nuts shall conform 
to Specification A194/Al94M. 
14. Certification 
14.1 Certification is required. In addition to the require­
ments of Specification A962/ A962M the rep01i shall include 
results of the chemical analysis, macroetch examination (Car­
bon and Alloy Steels Only), and mechanical tests, and state the 
method of heat treatment employed.
