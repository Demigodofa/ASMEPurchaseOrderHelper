Scope \n1.1 This specification covers several grades of mini\u00ad\nmum-wall-thickness, seamless and welded, carbon and \nalloy-steel tubes intended for use at low temperatures. \nSome product sizes may not be available under this speci\u00ad\nfication because heavier wall thicknesses have an adverse \naffect on low-temperature impact properties. \n1.2 Supplementary Requirement S 1 of an optional \nnature is provided. This shall apply only when specified \nby the purchaser. \nNOTE 1 - For tubing smaller than \u00bd in. [12. 7 mm] in outside diameter, \nthe elongation values given for strip specimens in Table 1 shall apply. \nMechanical property requirements do not apply to tubing smaller than \u00bd \nin. [3.2 mm] in outside diameter and with a wall thickness under O.QlS \nin. [0.4 mm]. \n1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \nunits are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the \ntext, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated \nin each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem must be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in nonconformance \nwith the specification. The inch-pound units shall apply \nunless the \"M\" designation of this specification is specified \nin the order. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA 370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Test\u00ad\ning of Steel Products \nA 1016/ A 1016M Specification for General Requirements \nfor Ferritic Alloy Steel, Austenitic Alloy Steel, and \nStainless Steel Tubes \nE 23 Test Methods for Notched Bar Impact Testing of \nMetallic Materials \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for material under this specification should \ninclude the following, as required to describe the desired \nmaterial adequately: \n3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), \n3.1.2 Name of material (seamless or welded tubes), \n3.1.3 Grade (Table 1), \n3.1.4 Size (outside diameter and minimum wall \nthickness), \n3.1.5 Length (specific or random), \n3.1.6 Optional requirements (other temperatures, \nSection 14; hydrostatic or electric test, Section 16), \n3.1.7 Test report required, (Certification Section of \nSpecification A 1016/ A 1016M), \n494 \n3.1.8 Specification designation, and \n3.1.9 Special requirements and any supplementary \nrequirements selected. \n4. General Requirements \n4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall \nconform to the applicable requirements of the current edi\u00ad\ntion of Specification A 1016/ A 1016M, unless otherwise \nprovided herein. \n5. Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 The tubes shall be made by the seamless or auto\u00ad\nmatic welding process with no addition of filler metal in \nthe welding operation. ",
