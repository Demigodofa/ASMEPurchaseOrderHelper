This length may be increased at \nthe option of the foundry to accommo\u00ad\ndate additional test bars (see Note 1). \nUse of and size of end taper is at the \noption of the foundry. \n11/ 4 in.

[13 mm] radius will be used \nbetween the legs. \nThe tensile, bend, and impact bars will be \ntaken from the lower portion of the leg \n(see Note 2). \nThe number of legs attached to the cou\u00ad\npon is at the option of the foundry pro\u00ad\nviding they are equispaced according to \nitem 6. \nRadius from O to approximately 1 / 16 in. \n[2 mmJ. \n1.

The length of the riser at the top \ntherefore depends on the amount of \ntaper added to the riser. \nThe width of the riser at the base of a \nmultiple-leg coupon shall be n, 2\u00bc \n[57 mm] - % [16 mm] where n \nequals the number of legs attached to \nthe coupon. The width of the riser at \nthe top is therefore dependent on the \namount of taper added to the riser. \nUse of and size is at the option of the \nfoundry. \nThe minimum height of the riser shall be \n2 in. [51 mmJ. The maximum height \nis at the option of the foundry for the \nfollowing reasons: Cal Many risers are \ncast open, (bl different compositions \nmay require variation in risering for \nsoundness, (cl different pouring tem\u00ad\nperatures may require variation in ris\u00ad\nering for soundness. \nNOTE 1 - Test Coupons for Large and Heavy Steel Castings: The test coupons in Fig. 2 are to be used for large and heavy steel castings. \nHowever, at the option of the foundry the cross-sectional area and length of the standard coupon may be increased as desired. \nNOTE 2 - Bend Bar: If a bend bar is required, an alternate design (as shown by dotted lines in Fig. 2) is indicated. \n1442 ",
