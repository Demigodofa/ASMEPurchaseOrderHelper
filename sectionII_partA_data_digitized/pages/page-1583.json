These permitted variations in outside diameter apply to hot\u00ad\nfinished seamless, welded and cold-finished seamless tubes before other fabri\u00ad\ncating operations such as upsetting, swaging, expanding, bending, or polishing. \n10.3 For cold-finished seamless austenitic and ferritic/ \naustenitic tubes, an ovality allowance is necessary for all sizes \nless than 2 in. [50.8 mm] outside diameter, because they are \nlikely to become out of round during their final heat treatment. \nFor such tubes, the maximum and minimum outside diameter \nat any cross section shall not deviate from the nominal \ndiameter by more than \u00b10.010 in. [\u00b10.25 mm]. However, the \nmean diameter at that cross section must still be within the \ngiven permitted variation given in Table 3. In the event of \nconflict between the provisions of 10.2.1 and those of 10.3, the \nlarger value of ovality tolerance shall apply. \n10.4 When the specified wall is 2 % or less of the specified \nOD, the method of measurement is per agreement between \npurchaser and manufacturer (see Note 2). \nNom 2-Very thin wall tubing may not be stiff enough for the outside \ndiameter to be accurately measured with a point contact method, such as \nwith the use of a micrometer or caliper. When very thin walls are \nspecified, \"go\" - \"no go\" ring gauges are commonly used to measure \ndiameters of 1 \u00bd in. [38.1 mm] or less. A 0.002 in. [0.05 mm] additional \ntolerance is usually added on the \"go\" ring gauge to allow clearance for \nsliding. On larger diameters, measurement is commonly performed with a \npi tape. Other methods, such as optical methods, may also be considered. \n11. Permitted Variations in Length \n11.1 Variations from the specified length shall not exceed \nthe amounts prescribed in Table 4. \n12. Permitted Variations in Height of Flash on Electric\u00ad\nResistance-Welded Tubes \n12.1 For tubes over 2 in. [50.8 mm] in outside diameter, or \nover 0.135 in. [3.44 mm] in wall thickness, the flash on the \ninside of the tubes shall be mechanically removed by cutting to \na maximum height of 0.010 in. [0.25 mm] at any point on the \ntube. \n12.2 For tubes 2 in. [50.8 mm] and under in outside \ndiameter and 0.135 in. [3.44 mm] and under in wall thickness, \nthe flash on the inside of the tube shall be mechanically \nremoved by cutting to a maximum height of 0.006 in. [0.15 \nmm] at any point on the tube. \n13. Straightness and Finish \n13.1 Finished tubes shall be reasonably straight and have \nsmooth ends free of burrs. They shall have a workmanlike \nfinish. It is permitted to remove surface imperfections by \ngrinding, provided that a smooth curved surface is maintained, \nand the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that \npermitted by this or the product specification, or the purchase \norder. The outside diameter at the point of grinding may be \nreduced by the amount so removed. \n14. Repair by Welding \n14.1 Repair welding of base metal defects in tubing is \npermitted only with the approval of the purchaser and with the \nfurther understanding that the tube shall be marked \"WR\" and \nthe composition of the deposited filler metal shall be suitable \nfor the composition being welded. Defects shall be thoroughly \nchipped or ground out before welding and each repaired length \nshall be reheat treated or stress relieved as required by the \napplicable specification. Each length of repaired tube shall be \nexamined by a nondestructive test as required by the product \nspecification. \n14.2 Repair welding shall be performed using procedures \nand welders or welding operators that have been qualified in \naccordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, \nSection IX. \nTABLE 4 Permitted Variations in LengthA \nSpecified \nMethod of Outside Cut Length, in. [mm] \nManufacture Diameter, in. Over Under \n[mm) \nSeamless, hot-finished All sizes \u2022/10 [5] 0 [OJ \nSeamless, cold-finished Under 2 [50.8) 1/e [3] 0 [OJ \n2 [50.8] or over 3/,5 [5] 0 [OJ \nWelded Under 2 [50.8) 1/e [3] 0 [OJ \n2 [50.8] or over o/10 [5] 0 [0] \nA These permitted variations in length apply to tubes before bending. They apply \nto cut lengths up to and including 24 ft [7 .3 m]. For lengths greater than 24 ft [7 .3 \nm], the above over-tolerances shall be increased by 1/a in. (3 mm] for each 1 Oft [3 \nm] or fraction thereof over 24 ft or \u00bd in. [13 mm], whichever is the lesser. \n1529 ",
