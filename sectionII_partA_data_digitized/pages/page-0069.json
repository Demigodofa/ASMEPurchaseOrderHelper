Shapes with the greatest \ncross-sectional dimension greater than 6 in. [150 mm] shall \nhave the manufacturer's name, brand, or trademark shown in \nraised letters at intervals along the length. In addition, shapes \nshall be identified with the ASTM designation (year-date not \nrequired) and grade, either by marking each piece individually, \nby permanently affixing a colorfast, weather-resistant label or \ntag, or, if bundled, by attaching a substantial tag to the bundle. \n18.2.2 Bundling for shipment of small shapes with the \ngreatest cross-sectional dimension not greater than 6 in. [150 \nmm] is permissible. Each lift or bundle shall be marked or \nsubstantially tagged showing the identification information \nlisted in 18.2.1. \n18.2.3 It shall be permissible for the manufacturer to make \na full size bundle at the end of a heat by adding product from \na consecutively rolled heat of the same nominal chemical \ncomposition. The manufacturer shall identify a bundle consist\u00ad\ning of product from two heats with the number of the first heat \nrolled or identify both heats. The manufacturer shall maintain \nrecords of the heats contained in each bundle. \n18.3 Steel Sheet Piling-Steel sheet piling shall be marked \nwith the heat number, size of section, length, and mill identi\u00ad\nfication marks on each piece, either by marking, or by \npermanently affixing colorfast, weather-resistant label or tag. \nThe manufacturer's name, brand, or trademark shall be shown \nin raised letters at intervals along the length. \n18.4 Bars-Bars of all sizes, when loaded for shipment, \nshall be properly identified with the name or brand of \nmanufacturer, purchaser's name and order number, the ASTM \ndesignation number (year-date not required), grade number \nwhere appropriate, size and length, weight [mass] of lift, and \nthe heat number for identification. Unless otherwise specified, \nthe method of marking is at the manufacturer's option and shall \nbe made by hot stamping, cold stamping, painting, or marking \ntags attached to the lifts of bars. Bars are not required to be \ndie-stamped. \n18.4.1 It shall be permissible for the manufacturer to make \na full size bundle at the end of a heat by adding product from \na consecutively rolled heat of the same nominal chemical \ncomposition. The manufacturer shall identify a bundle consist\u00ad\ning of product from two heats with the number of the first heat \nrolled or identify both heats. The manufacturer shall maintain \nrecords of the heats contained in each bundle. \n17 \n18.5 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements of 18.1 -\n18.4 inclusive, the manufacturer or processor shall have the \noption of using bar coding as a supplementary identification \nmethod. \nNoTE 10-Bar coding should be consistent with AIAG Standards. \n18.6 Subdivided Material: \n18.6.1 Except as allowed by 18.6.2, pieces separated from \na master structural product by an organization other than the \noriginal manufacturer shall be identified with the ASTM \ndesignation (year-date not required), grade, heat number, and \nthe heat treatment identification, if applicable, along with the \ntrademark, brand, or name of the organization subdividing the \nstructural product. The identification methods shall be in \naccordance with the requirements of 18.1 - 18.4 inclusive, \nexcept that the raised letters method for shapes and steel sheet \npiling is not required. If the original manufacturer's identifi\u00ad\ncation remains intact, the structural product need not be \nadditionally identified by the organization supplying the struc\u00ad\ntural product. \n18.6.2 It shall be permissible for pieces from the same heat \nof structural product to be bundled or placed in secured lifts, \nwith the identification specified in 18.6.1 placed on the top \npiece of each lift or shown on a substantial tag attached to each \nbundle or lift. \n19. Packaging, Marking, and Loading for Shipment \n19.1 Packaging, marking, and loading for shipment shall be \nin accordance with Practices A 700. \n19.2 When Level A is specified, and when specified in the \ncontract or order, and for direct procurement by or direct \nshipment to the U.S. government, preservation, packaging, and \npacking shall be in accordance with the Level A requirements \nof MIL-STD-163. \n19.3 When specified in the contract or order, and for direct \nprocurement by or direct shipment to the U.S. government, \nmarking for shipment, in addition to requirements specified in \nthe contract or order, shall be in accordance with MIL-STD-\n129 for military agencies and with Fed.
