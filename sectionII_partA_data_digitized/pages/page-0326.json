A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers minimum-wall-thickness, \nseamless medium-carbon steel, boiler tubes and boiler flues, \nincluding safe ends (see Note 1), arch and stay tubes, and \nsuperheater tubes. \nNoTE 1-This type is not suitable for safe ending by forge welding. \n1.2 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to \nthis specification are\u00bd in. to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside \ndiameter and 0.035 to 0.500 in. [0.9 to 12.7 mm], inclusive, in \nminimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may \nbe furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other \nrequirements of this specification. \n1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to \ntubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 \nin. [0.4 mm] in thickness. \n1.4 This specification covers grades A-1 and C of Seamless \nMedium-Carbon Boiler and Superheater Tubes with different \nchemical and tensile requirements. (Table 1, Table 3, and \nSection 11.) \n1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must \nbe used independently of the other. Combining values from the \ntwo systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi\u00ad\ncation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \n1.6 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.09 on Carbon Steel Tubular Products. \nCurrent edition approved May I, 2019. Published May 2019. Originally \napprov.ed in 1938. Last previous edition approved in _2012 as A210/A210M- 02 \n(2012). DOI: 10.1520/A0210_A0210M-19. \n2 For ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code applications see related Specifi\u00ad\ncation SA-210 in Section II of that Code. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: 3 \nA450/A450M Specification for General Requirements for \nCarbon and Low Alloy Steel Tubes \n3. Ordering Information \n3 .1 Orders for material under this specification should \ninclude the following, as required, to describe the desired \nmaterial adequately: \n3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), \n3.1.2 Name of material (seamless tubes), \n3.1.3 Grade, \n3.1.4 Manufacture (hot-finished or cold-finished), \n3 .1.5 Size ( outside diameter and minimum wall thickness), \n3.1.6 Length (specific or random), \n3.1.7 Optional requirements (Sections 7 and 10), \n3.1.8 Test report required, (see Certification Section of \nSpecification A450/ A450M), \n3.1.9 Specification designation, and \n3.1.10 Special requirements. \n4. General Requirements \n4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con\u00ad\nform to the applicable requirements of the current edition of \nSpecification A450/A450M, unless otherwise provided herein. \n5. Manufacture \n5.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed. \n5.2 The tubes shall be made by the seamless process and \nshall be either hot-finished or cold-finished, as specified. \n6. Heat Treatment \n6.1 Hot-finished tubes need not be heat treated. Cold\u00ad\nfinished tubes shall be given a subcritical anneal, a full anneal, \nor a normalizing heat treatment after the final cold finishing \nprocess. \n3 For referenced ASTM standards, visit the ASTM website, www.asttn.org, or \ncontact ASTM Customer Service at service@astm.org.
