ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-989 /SA-989M 
the same final heat treatment charge, after hot isostatic­
pressing or after final heat treatment. The microstructure shall 
meet the requirements of 8.1.3.1. 
8.1.3.3 If the sample fails to meet the requirements for 
acceptance, it is permitted to retest each part in the lot. Each 
part that passes the requirements of 8.1.3.1 shall be accepted. 
8.2 Hydrostatic Tests-After they have been machined, 
pressure-containing parts shall be tested to the hydrostatic shell 
test pressures prescribed in ASME B16.5 for the applicable 
steel rating for which the part is designed, and shall show no 
leaks. Parts ordered under these specifications for working 
pressures other than those listed in the ASME B16.5 ratings 
shall be tested to such pressures as may be agreed upon 
between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
8.2.1 No hydrostatic test is required for welding neck or 
other flanges. 
8.2.2 The compact manufacturer is not required to perform 
pressure tests on rough parts that are to be finish machined by 
others. The fabricator of the finished part is not required to 
pressure test parts that are designed to be pressure-containing 
only after assembly by welding into a larger structure. The 
manufacturer of the compacts, however, shall be responsible as 
required in 15.1 for the satisfactory performance of the parts 
under the final test required in 8.2. 
9. Mechanical Properties 
9 .1 The material shall conform to . the requirements for 
mechanical properties prescribed in Table 3 at room tempera­
ture. 
9.2 Mechanical test samples shall be obtained from the 
component stem, protrusion, or test part made from a single 
powder blend consolidated in the same hot-isostatic press using 
the same pressure, temperature, and time parameter and 
heat-treated in the same final heat-treatment charge. If repair 
welding is required (see Section 15), the test specimens prior to 
testing shall accompany the repaired parts if a post weld heat 
treatment is done. 
9.3 For normalized and tempered parts, or quenched and 
tempered parts, the central axis of the test specimen shall 
correspond to the ¼ T plane or deeper position where Tis the 
maximum heat treated thickness of the represented part. In 
addition, for quenched and tempered parts, the midlength of the 
test specimen shall be at least T from any second heat treated 
surface. When the section thickness does not permit this 
positioning, the test specimen shall be positioned as near as 
possible to the prescribed location, as agreed to by the 
purchaser and the supplier. 
9.3.1 Alternatively, with prior approval of the purchaser, it 
is permitted to take the test specimen for the steel parts at a 
depth (t) corresponding to the distance from the area of 
significant stress to the nearest heat treated surface and at least 
twice this distance (2t) from any second surface. The test 
depth, however, shall not be nearer to one treated surface than 
¾ in. [19 mm] and to the second treated surface than 1 ½ in. 
[38 mm]. This method of test specimen location would 
normally apply to complex parts, or parts with thick cross­
sectional areas where ¼ T and T testing (see 9.3) is not 
practical. Sketches showing the exact test locations shall be 
approved by the purchaser when this method is used. 
9 .4 For annealed alloy steels the test specimen may be taken 
from any convenient location. 
9.5 Tension Test: 
9.5.1 One tension test shall be made for each production lot 
in each heat treatment charge. 
9.5.1.1 When the heat treating cycles are the same and the 
furnaces ( either batch or continuous type) are controlled within 
±25 °F [±14 °C] and equipped with recording pyrometers so 
that complete records of heat treatment are available, then only 
one tension test from each production lot of each type of part, 
and section size is required instead of one test from each 
production lot in each heat-treatment charge. The term "type," 
as used here, designates a characteristic shape of a part, such as 
flange, elbow, tee, and so forth. 
9.5.1.2 The tension test specimen shall be made from 
material accompanying the parts in final heat treatment. 
9.5.2 Testing shall be performed as specified in Specifica­
tion A961/A961M using the largest feasible of the round 
specimens. 
9.6 Hardness Tests: 
9.6.1 When two or more parts are produced, a minimum of 
two pieces per batch or continuous run as defined in 9.6.2 shall 
be hardness tested as specified in Specification A961/A961M 
to ensure that the parts are within the hardness limits given for 
each grade in Table 3. When only one part is produced, it shall 
be hardness tested as required. The purchaser is permitted to 
verify that the requirement has been met by testing at any 
location on any part, provided such testing does not render the 
part useless. 
9.6.2 When the reduced number of tension tests permitted 
by 9 .5 .1.1 is applied, additional hardness tests shall be made on
