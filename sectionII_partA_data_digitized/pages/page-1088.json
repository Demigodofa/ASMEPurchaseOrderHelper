The resampling shall be \nappropriate to the specific out-of-specification condition and \nthe processing history of the lot. \n11.2.1.3 A maximum of two resampling efforts shall be \npermitted. If after conducting two resampling efforts, the \nmaterial does not satisfy the specification requirements, the lot \nshall be rejected. \n12. Inspection \n12.1 When purchaser's order stipulates that inspection and \ntests (except product analyses) for acceptance on the steel be \nmade prior to shipment from the mill, the manufacturer shall \nafford the purchaser's inspector all reasonable facilities to \nsatisfy him that the steel is being produced and furnished in \naccordance with the specification. Mill inspection by the \npurchaser shall not interfere unnecessarily with the manufac\u00ad\ntnrer' s operation. \n14.2 The manufacturer or processor shall issue a test report \nor optional certificate of compliance, or both, when required by \nthe purchase order or the specification. \n14.3 The test report shall show the heat analysis and the \nresults of all tests required by the purchase order and seller and \nby the specification. \n14.4 The certificate of compliance shall include a statement \nthat the product was manufactured and tested in accordance \nwith the requirements of the specification and that the test \nresults conform to the requirements of the specification. \nNorn 4-The heat analysis, results of all tests, and the certificate of \ncompliance may be reported separately on in a combined report. \n14.5 Steel processors shall pass transfer data supplied by the \nsteel manufacturer provided the processing has not altered the \nattributes represented. In cases where the steel is retested the \nprocessor is responsible for the accuracy of the data and shall \nmaintain traceability back to its source. Retesting for heat \nanalysis shall be done in accordance with the specification Test \nMethods A751. The report shall clearly identify the physical \nproduct it represents. \n14.6 Test rep01is and certificates of compliance shall pro\u00ad\nvide information necessary to identify the product represented; \nfor example the manufacturer's name or brand, the processor's \nname or brand or the seller's name or brand, ASTM specifi\u00ad\ncation number and year date, product designation, type or \nclass, as applicable, and all other information necessary to \ncompletely identify the material. \n14.7 A signature is not required on test reports or certifica\u00ad\ntions. However, the document shall clearly identify the orga\u00ad\nnization submitting the document. Notwithstanding the ab\u00ad\nsence of a signature, the organization submitting the document \nis responsible for the content of the document. \n14.8 When required, copies of the original material manu\u00ad\nfacturer's test report shall be included with any subsequent test \nreport. \n14.9 A Material Test Report, Certificate of Inspection, or \n13. Rejection and Rehearing similar document printed from or used in electronic form from \n13.l Unless otherwise specified, any rejection shall b~ electroni~ata interchange_ (EDI) transmission s~all be \nrep01ied to the manufacturer within a reasonable time after regardedasliavmg the same vahc:!ity as a counterpart prmte~ \nrecei t of material by the purchaser. the certifier's facility. The c?ntent of the ~DI transmitted \np document must meet the reqmrements of the mvoked ASTM \n13.2 Material that is reported to be defective subsequent to standard(s) and confonn to any existing EDI agreement be-\nthe acceptance at the purchaser's works shall be set aside, tween the purchaser and the supplier. Notwithstanding the \nadequately protected, and correctly identified. The manufac- absence of a signature, the organization submitting the EDI \nturer shall be notified as soon as possible so that an investiga- transmission is responsible for the content of the report. \ntion may be initiated. 14.9.1 The content of the EDI document shall meet all the \n13.3 Samples that are representative of the rejected material requirements of 14.3 through 14.6. \nshall be made available to the manufacturer. In the event that \nthe manufacturer is dissatisfied with the rejection, he may \nrequest a rehearing. \n14. Test Reports and Certification \n14.1 When test repo1is are required by the purchase order or \nthe material specification, the supplier shall report the results of \nall test required by the material specification and the order. \n988 \nNoTE 5-The industry definition as invoked here is: EDI is the \ncomputer to computer exchange of business information in an agreed upon \nstandard format such as ANSI ASC Xl2. \n15. Product Marking \n15.1 As a minimum requirement, the material shall be \nidentified by having the manufacturer's name, ASTM \ndesignation, weight, purchaser's order number, and material ",
