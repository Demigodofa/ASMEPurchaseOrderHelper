General Requirements and Ordering Information \n3.1 The inquiry and orders shall include the following, as \nrequired, to describe the desired bolting material or bolting \ncomponents adequately: \n3.1.1 Heat-treated condition (that is carbide solution treated \n(Class 1), carbide solution treated after finishing (Class lA), \nand carbide solution treated and strain-hardened (Classes 2, 2B \nand 2C), for the austenitic stainless steels; Classes 1B and lC \napply to the carbide solution-treated nitrogen-bearing stainless \nsteels; Class lD applies to bolting material that is carbide \nsolution treated by cooling rapidly from the rolling \ntemperature), \n3.1.2 Description of items required (that is, bars, bolts, \nscrews, or studs), \n3.1.3 Nuts, if required by purchaser, in accordance with \n13.1, \n3.1.4 Supplementary requirements, if any, and \n3.1.5 Special requirements, in accordance with 6.1.5.1, \n6.2.6, 8.1, and 13.1. \n3.2 Coatings-Coatings are prohibited unless specified by \nthe purchaser (See Supplementary Requirements S13 and Sl4). \nWhen coated bolting components are ordered the purchaser \nshould take special care to ensure that Appendix X2 is \nthoroughly understood. \n4. Common Requirements \n4.1 Bolting materials and bolting components supplied to \nthis specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci\u00ad\nfication A962/ A962M. These requirements include test \nmethods, finish, thread dimensions, macroetch (alloy steels \nonly), marking, certification, optional supplementary \nrequirements, and others. Failure to comply with the require\u00ad\nments of Specification A962/ A962M constitutes nonconfor\u00ad\nmance with this specification. In case of conflict between this \nspecification and Specification A962/A962M, this specification \nshall prevail. \n5.

Heat Treatment \n6.1 Ferritic Steels: \n6.1.1 Ferritic steels shall be allowed to cool to a temperature \n\u2022 below the cooling transformation range immediately after \nrolling or forging. Bolting materials shall then be uniformly \nreheated to the proper temperature to refine the grain (a group \nthus reheated being lmown as a quenching charge), quenched \n235 ",
