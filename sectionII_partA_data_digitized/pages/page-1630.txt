SA/EN 10028-3 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR FLAT PRODUCTS MADE OF 
STEELS FOR PRESSURE PURPOSES 
Part 3: Weldable Fine Grain Steels, Normalized 
SA/EN 10028-3 
(Identical with International Specification EN 10028-3:2017 with these additional requirements.) 
1. Additional Requirements 
1.1 General Requirements: 
All "see EN 10028-1" shall be read as "shall be according 
to EN 10028-1." 
1.2 Marking: 
(a) In addition to the marking requirements of this 
specification, all products required to be marked and 
material identification used on all documentation 
required by this specification are to be identified by 
this SA/EN specification designation. 
(b) Plates that have been given the full heat treatment 
required by para. 8.2.1 or 8.2.2 shall be marked by the 
party performing the heat treatment with the letters 
designating the applicable heat treatment condition in 
Table 4 of EN 10028-3 following the stamped steel 
name or number. 
(c) Plates for which normalizing has been replaced by 
normalizing rolling as permitted by para. 8.2.2 shall be 
marked "+NR" instead of "+N." 
( d) Plates that are not heat treated but are qualified on 
the basis of heat treated specimens per para. 8.2.3 shall be 
stamped with letter "G" following the stamped specifica­
tion designation. 
(e) When such plates are subsequently heat treated, 
they shall be marked, by the party that performed the 
heat treatment, as required by (b) above following the 
required stamped specification designation. 
1.3 Chemical Composition: 
The requirements of paras. 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 on heat 
analysis, and of paras. 7.2.3 and 7.2.4 on product analysis, 
of SA-20/SA-20M shall apply. In addition, the copper 
content shall be per SA-20/SA-20M Table 1. 
1.4 Impact Test Sampling: 
Deviation from the requirement for preparation of test 
pieces for impact testing in EN 10028-1 shall not be 
permitted in SA/EN 10028-3. 
1.5 Steelmaking Process: 
The ratio of reduction of thickness from a strand-cast 
slab to plate shall be at least 3.0:1. 
1.6 Quality: 
All surface imperfections, the removal of which will 
reduce the plate thickness below its permissible 
minimum, shall be cause for rejection of the plate; 
however by agreement with the purchaser, the metal 
so removed may be replaced with weld metal. 
Preparation for repair welding shall include inspection 
to assure complete removal of the defect. 
Repairs shall be made utilizing welding procedures 
qualified in accordance with ASME Section IX and 
repair welding shall be done by welders or welding opera­
tors meeting the qualification requirements of ASME 
Section IX. 
1.7 Test Reports: 
1.7,l The designation of this SA/EN specification 
shall include the edition year. 
1.7.2 Copies of the original manufacturer's test 
report shall be included with any subsequent test report.
