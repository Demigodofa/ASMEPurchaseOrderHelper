3. Terminology 
3 .1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 cold-finished steel bars-steel bars produced by cold 
finishing previously hot-wrought bars by means of cold 
drawing, cold forming, turning, grinding, or polishing (singly 
or in combination) to yield straight lengths or coils in sections 
that are uniform throughout their length and in the following 
sections and sizes: 
3.1.1.1 rounds-9 in. [230 mm] and under in diameter, 
3.1.1.2 squares-6 in. [150 mm] and under between parallel 
surfaces, 
3.1.1.3 hexagons-4 in. [100 mm] and under between par­
allel surfaces, 
3.1.1.4 fiats-Vs in. [3 mm] and over in thickness and not 
over 12 in. [300 mm] in width, and 
3.1.1.5 special bar sections. 
3.1.2 hot-wrought steel bars-steel bars produced by hot 
forming ingots, blooms, billets, or other semifinished forms to 
yield straight lengths ( or coils, depending upon size, section, 
and mill equipment) in sections that are uniform throughout 
their length, and in the following sections and sizes: 
3.1.2.1 rounds-½2 in. to 10.0 in. [5.5 mm to 250 mm], 
inclusive; 
3.1.2.2 squares-½2 in. to 6.0 in. [6 mm to 160 mm], 
inclusive; 
3.1.2.3 round-cornered squares-1/32 in. to 8.0 in. [6 mm to 
200 mm], inclusive; 
3.1.2.4 fiats-¼ in. to 8 in. inclusive, in width: 13 /64 in. in 
minimum thickness up to 6 in. in width; and 0.230 in. in 
minimum thickness for over 6 in. to 8 in. in width, inclusive 
[ over 5 mm in thickness up to 150 mm in width; and over 6 mm 
in thickness for over 150 mm through 200 mm in width]. 
Maximum thickness for all widths is 4 in. [100 mm]; 
3.1.2.5 hexagons and octagons-¼ in. to 4½6 in. [6 mm to 
103 mm], inclusive, between parallel surfaces; 
3.1.2.6 bar size shapes-Angles, channels, tees, zees, when 
their greatest cross-sectional dimension is under 3 in. [75 mm]; 
and 
3.1.2.7 special bar sections-Half-rounds, ovals, half-ovals, 
other special bar size sections. 
3.1.3 lot-unless otherwise specified in the contract or 
order, a lot shall consist of all bars submitted for inspection at 
the same time of the same heat, condition, finish, size, or shape. 
For bars specified in the quenched and tempered condition, 
when heat treated in batch-type furnaces, a lot shall consist of 
all bars from the same heat, of the same prior condition, the 
same size, and subjected to the same heat treatment in one 
tempering charge. For bars specified in the quenched and 
tempered condition, when heat treated without interruption in a 
continuous-type furnace, a lot shall consist of all bars from the 
same heat, of the same prior condition, of the same size, and 
subjected to the same heat treatment.
