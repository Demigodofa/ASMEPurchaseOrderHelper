14.3 The following information is for the benefit of the user 
of this specification: 
14.3.1 The reference standards defined in 14.4 through 14.6 
are convenient. standards for calibration of nondestructive 
testing equipment. The dimensions of such standards are not to 
be construed as the minimum sizes of imperfections detectable 
by such equipment. 
14.3.2 The ultrasonic testing referred to in this specification 
is capable of detecting the presence and location of significant 
longitudinally or circumferentially oriented imperfections; 
however, different techniques need to be employed for the 
detection of such differently oriented imperfections. Ultrasonic 
testing is not necessarily capable of detecting short, deep 
imperfections. 
14.3.3 The eddy current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
imperfections, especially of the short abrupt type. 
14.3.4 The flux leakage examination referred to in this 
specification is capable of detecting the presence and location 
of significant longitudinally or transversely oriented imperfec­
tions; however, different techniques need to be employed for 
the detection of such differently oriented imperfections. 
14.3.5 The hydrostatic test referred to in Section 13 has the 
capability of finding defects of a size permitting the test fluid 
to leak through the tube wall and may be either visually seen 
or detected by a loss of pressure. Hydrostatic testing is not 
necessarily capable of detecting very tight, through-the-wall 
impe1fections or imperfections that extend an appreciable 
distance into the wall without complete penetration. 
14.3.6 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can 
be detected in the specific applications of these examinations is 
directed to discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
14.4 For ultrasonic testing, the calibration reference notches 
shall be, at the option of the producer, any one of the three 
common notch shapes shown in Practice E213. The depth of 
notch shall not exceed 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of 
the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. 
14.5 For eddy current testing, the calibration pipe shall 
contain, at the option of the producer, any one of the following 
discontinuities to establish a minimum sensitivity level for 
rejection: 
14.5.1 Drilled Hole-The calibration pipe shall contain 
depending upon the pipe diameter three holes spaced 120° 
apart or four holes spaced 90° apart and sufficiently separated 
longitudinally to ensure separately distinguishable responses. 
The holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the 
pipe wall, care being taken to avoid distortion of the pipe while 
drilling. Depending upon the pipe diameter the calibration pipe 
shall contain the following hole: 
NPS ON Diameter of Drilled Hole 
s ½ s 15 0.039 in. [1 mm] 
> ½ s 1¼ > 15 s 32 0.055 in. [1.4 mm] 
> 1¼ s 2 > 32 s 50 0.071 in. [1.8 mm] 
> 2 s 5 > 50 s 125 0.087 in. [2.2 mm] 
>5 > 125 0.106 in. [2.7 mm] 
14.5.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool or 
file with a ¼-in. [6-mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe. The notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12 ½ % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. 
14.5.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
tube axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to have a depth not 
exceeding 12 ½ % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
14.5.4 Compatibility-The discontinuity in the calibration 
pipe shall be compatible with the testing equipment and the 
method being used. 
14.6 For flux leakage testing, the longitudinal calibration 
reference notches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a 
radial plane parallel to the pipe axis. For wall thicknesses under 
½ in. [12.7 mm], outside and inside notches shall be used; for 
wall thicknesses equal to and above½ in. [12.7 mm], only an 
outside notch shall be used. Notch depth shall not exceed 
12½ % of the specified wall thickness, or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], 
whichever is greater. Notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25 
mm], and the width shall not exceed the depth. Outside 
diameter and inside diameter notches shall be located suffi­
ciently apart to allow separation and identification of the 
signals. 
14.7 Pipe containing one or more imperfections that pro­
duce a signal equal to or greater than the signal produced by the 
calibration standard shall be rejected or the area producing the 
signal shall be reexamined. 
14.7.1 Test signals produced by imperfections which cannot 
be identified, or produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections 
shall result in rejection of the pipe, unless it is repaired and 
retested. To be accepted, the pipe must pass the same specifi­
cation test to which it was originally subjected, provided that 
the remaining wall thickness is not decreased below that 
pennitted by this specification. The OD at the point of grinding 
may be reduced by the amount so reduced. 
14.7.2 Test signals produced by visual imperfections such as 
those listed below may be evaluated in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 18: 
173 
14.7.2.1 Dinges, 
14.7.2.2 Straightener marks, 
14.7.2.3 Cutting chips, 
14.7.2.4 Scratches, 
14.7.2.5 Steel die stamps, 
14.7.2.6 Stop marks, or 
14.7.2.7 Pipe reducer ripple. 
14.8 The test methods described in this section are not 
necessarily capable of inspecting the end portion of pipes, a 
condition referred to as "end effect." The length of such end 
effect shall be determined by the manufacturer and, when 
specified in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
15. Nipples 
15.1 Nipples shall be cut from pipe of the same dimensions 
and quality described in this specification.
