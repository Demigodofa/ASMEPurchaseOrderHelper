7.2 Conditioning of castings is permitted to the extent that 
the removal of metal does not extend into the envelope of the 
finished container and does not alter the properties of the metal 
remaining in the finished container. 
8. Repair 
8.1 Castings shall not be repaired by plugging, welding, 
brazing, impregnation, or any other means. 
9. Sampling 
9.1 Test coupons will be obtained from the casting. The 
location in the casting from which the test coupons are 
obtained and the number obtained from each location shall be 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
9.2 Metallographic samples shall be obtained from the same 
location as the mechanical test coupons. 
9.3 Nondestructive examination methods for estimating mi­
crostructure may be used to supplement the destructive exami­
nation sampling plan. 
9.4 Sampling for chemical analysis shall be in accordance 
with Practice E 59. 
9 .4 .1 The chemical analysis for total. carbon shall be made 
on either chilled cast pencil-type specimens or thin wafers 
approximately 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] thick cut from test coupons. 
10. Number of Tests and Retests 
10.1 The number of tension tests and the number of micro­
structural examinations shall be agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and purchaser. 
10.2 If any tension test specimen shows obvious defects, it 
may be discarded and another from the same coupon may be 
tested. 
11. Test Methods 
n .1 Conduct the tension test in accordance with Test 
Methods E 8. 
11.2 Detemune the yield strength using one of the following 
methods: 
11.2.1 The 0.2 % offset method, or 
11.2.2 Extension under load method where the yield 
strength may be determined as the stress producing an elonga­
tion under load of 0.330 %, that is, 0.0066 in. [0.165 mm] in a 
gage length of 2 in. [50 mm]. 
11.3 Determine the percent of each graphite nodule type by 
manual coating, semi-automatic, or automatic image analysis 
methods. The manual count method shall prevail when the 
results of other methods differ. Magnification shall be at 100 X. 
11.4 Spectrometric methods may be used for chemical 
analysis. Should a dispute arise concerning chemical compo­
sition, use Test Methods E 351 and E 30 for referee methods. 
12. Records 
12.1 Records of the chemical composition, mechanical 
properties, and the metallographic examination shall be sys­
tematically made and maintained. 
13. Inspection 
13.1 Unless otherwise specified in the contract or purchase 
order, the manufacturer shall perform all of the tests and 
inspections required by the specification. 
13.2 AH tests and inspections shall be made at the place of 
manufactLu-e or a mutually agreed upon location. 
13.3 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry at all times, while work on the contract of the purchaser 
is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's works 
that concern the manufacture of the material ordered. The 
manufacturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities 
to satisfy that the material is being furnished in accordance 
with these specifications. The inspector representing the pur­
chaser shall not interfere unnecessarily with the operation of 
the works. 
14. Certification 
14.1 The manufacturer's certification shall be furnished to 
the purchaser stating the material was manufactured, sampled, 
tested, and inspected in accordance with this specification 
(including the year of issue) and was found to meet the 
requirement(s). In addition, a test report shall be included with 
the certification giving the results of all tests performed 
including chemical analysis. 
15. Product Marking 
15.l The casting shall be identified and shall be marked in 
accordance with instructions issued by the purchaser.
