DETERMINATION OF TEMPERATURE \nREDUCTIONS \nXl.1 Under the circumstances stated in 15 .4, the impact \ntest temperatures specified in Table 6 must be lowered. \nThe following examples are offered to describe the applica\u00ad\ntion of the provisions of 15.4. \nXl.1.1 When subsize specimens are used (see 14.1) \nand the width along the notch of the subsize specimen is \n80% or greater of the actual wall thickness of the original \nmaterial, the provisions of 15.4 do not apply. \nXl.1.1.1 For example, if the actual wall thickness \nof pipe was 0.200 in. [5.0 mm] and the width along the \nnotch of the largest subsize specimen obtainable is 0.160 \nin. [4 mm] or greater, no reduction in test temperature is \nrequired. \n503 \nXl.1.2 When the width along the subsize specimen \nnotch is less than 80% of the actual wall thickness of the \npipe, the required reduction in test temperature is computed \nby taking the difference between the temperature reduction \nvalues shown in Table 7 for the actual pipe thickness and \nthe specimen width used. \nXl.1.2.1 For example, if the pipe were 0.262 in. \n[6.67 mm] thick and the width along the Charpy specimen \nnotch was 3.33 mm(\u00bd standard size), the test temperature \nwould have to be lowered by 25\u00b0F [l4\u00b0C] (that is, the \ntemperature reduction corresponding to the subsize speci\u00ad\nmen is 35\u00b0F [l9\u00b0C], the temperature reduction correspond\u00ad\ning to the actual pipe thickness is 10\u00b0F [5\u00b0C]; the difference \nbetween these two values is the required reduction in test \ntemperature).
