Scope \n1.1 This specification covers requirements for high\u00ad\nstrength quenched and tempered alloy steel forgings for pres\u00ad\nsure vessels, isostatic presses, shock tubes, and similar com\u00ad\nponents. \n1.2 These materials are not intended for welded construc\u00ad\ntion. \n1.3 Three grades of nickel-chromium-molybdenum steels \nand six classes of increasing tensile strength are included. The \nstrength class, section size, and configuration of the forging \nwill largely dictate the applicable type(s) of steel. \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \n(metric) units are to be regarded separately as the standard. \nWithin the text and tables, the SI units are shown in brackets. \nThe values stated in each system are not exact equivalents; \ntherefore, each system must be used independently of the other. \nCombining values from the two systems may result in noncon\u00ad\nformance with the specification. \n1.5 Unless the order specifies the applicable \"M\" specifica\u00ad\ntion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch\u00ad\npound units. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA275/A275M Practice for Magnetic Particle Examination of \nSteel Forgings \nA370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Testing \nof Steel Products \nA388/A388M Practice for Ultrasonic Examination of Steel \nForgings \nA 788/ A 788M Specification for Steel Forgings, General Re\u00ad\nquirements \n2.2 Other Standards: \nASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code \n3. Ordering Information and General Requirements \n3.1 In addition to the ordering information required by \nSpecification A788/A788M, the purchaser shall include with \nthe inquiry and order a detailed drawing, sketch, or written \ndescription of the forging and the method of selecting test \nlocation (see 6.2). When appropriate, the areas of significant \nloading in the forging shall be designated. The purchaser may \nalso include appropriate supplementary requirements from \nSpecification A 788/ A 788M as well as from this specification. \n3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out\u00ad\nlines additional ordering information, manufacturing \nrequirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, \nmarking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi\u00ad\ntional supplementary requirements. \n3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A 788/ A 788M, the \nrequirements of this specification shall prevail. \n3.4 When forgings are required to be in compliance with \nDivision 3 of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, \nSupplementary Requirement S6 should be specified. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Melting Practice-The steel melting procedures of \nSpecification A 788/ A 788M shall apply except that the open\u00ad\nhearth process shall not be used, and that the steel shall be \nvacuum degassed prior to or during the pouring of the ingot, in \norder to remove objectionable gases, particularly hydrogen. \n4.1.1 Use of secondary remelting or refining operations may \nbe considered for particularly demanding applications. \n4.2 Discard-Sufficient discard shall be taken from each \ningot to secure freedom from piping and excessive segregation. \n1176 ",
