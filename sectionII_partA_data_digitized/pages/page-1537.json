A \nlist of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser is included in \nSpecification A703/A703M. Those which are ordinarily considered suitable for use with this \nspecification are given below. Others enumerated in Specification A 703/ A 703M may be used with this \nspecification upon agreement between the manufacturer and purchaser. \nSl. Unspecified Elements \nS2. Destruction Tests \nS5. Radiographic Inspection \nS6. Liquid Penetrant Inspection \nS8. Charpy Impact Test \nSlO. Examination of Weld Preparation \nSl0.1 Liquid penetrant examination of cavities prepared for \nwelding shall be performed to verify removal of those discon\u00ad\ntinuities found unacceptable by the inspection method specified \nfor the casting. The method of performing liquid penetrant \nexamination shall be in accordance with Practice El 65/ \nE165M. Unless other degrees of shrinkage or types of discon\u00ad\ntinuities found in the cavities are specified, Type II, Internal \nShrinkage, of Reference Photographs E125, of Degree 2 in \nsections up to 2 in. [50 mm] thick, and of Degree 3 in sections \nover 2 in. [50 mm] thick shall be acceptable. \nSll. Post-Weld Heat Treatment \nSll.1 Castings shall be given a post-weld solution heat \ntreatment in accordance with Table 1. \nSl2. Prior Approval of Major Weld Repairs \nOther supplementary requirements considered suitable for \nuse with this specification are: \nS50. Estimating Ferrite Content \nS50.1 Ferrite contents shall be determined by point count \n(Test Method E562), by other quantitative metallographic \nmethods such as image analysis, by measurement of magnetic \nresponse, or by other methods upon agreement between the \nmanufacturer and the purchaser. Frequency of testing and \nlocation of tests shall be by agreement between the manufac\u00ad\nturer and the purchaser. \nS51. Prior Approval of Weld Material \nS51.1 The purchaser must give approval of all weld filler \nmaterials to be used prior to any weld repairs. \nS52. Additional Requirements for Grade 6A \nS52.l Casting Thickness, T-The casting thickness, T, is the \nmaximum thickness of the pressure-containing wall of the \ncasting exclusive of padding added for directional \nsolidification, flanges, appendages, and sections designated by \nthe designer as noncritical. The order, inquiry, and drawing \nshall designate what the test dimension, T, is for the casting. \nS52.2 Charpy Impact Test-Charpy impact test properties \nshall be determined by testing a set of three Charpy V-notch \nimpact specimens made from each heat of material. \nS52.2.1 The thickness of the test blocks used to create \nCharpy impact test specimens shall be equal to the casting \nthickness, T. Charpy impact test specimens shall be removed \nfrom a location at one-half the thickness of the test block. \nS52.2.2 When the thickness of the test block is less than or \nequal to 4 in. [100 mm], Charpy impact testing shall be \nperformed at one of the test temperatures listed in Table S52.1. \nTABLE S52.1 Charpy Impact Testing of Base Material \nNorn 1-It is recommended that test temperature selection be deter\u00ad\nmined based on the intended service temperature of the casting. \nTest Temperature \n'F ['C] \n-51 [--46] \n-105 [-76] \n-150 [-101] \nCharpY V-Notch Impact Requirements \nEnergy Value, ft-lbf [J], min \nvalue for two specimens and Energy Value, ft-lbf [J], min \nmin average of three speci- for single specimen \nmens \n103 [140] \n66 [90] \n44 [60] \n77 [105] \n48 [65] \n33 [45] \nThe test temperature shall be provided by the purchaser. If the \ntest temperature is not specified, the test temperature used shall \nbe -51 \u00b0F [-46 \u00b0C]. The average value of the three specimens \nshall not be less than specified in Table S52.1, with no more \nthan one value permitted below the average minimum specified \nand no value permitted below the minimum specified for a \nsingle specimen. \nS52.2.3 When the thickness of the test block is greater than \n4 in. [100 mm], test temperature arid absorbed energy values \nshall be agreed upon between the purchaser and the manufac\u00ad\nturer. \nS52.3 Corrosion Testing-A Test Methods G48 Method A \nferric chloride pitting resistance test shall be performed for a \nduration of 24 h at 60 \u00b0C. \nS52.3.l The thickness of the test blocks used to create \ncorrosion test specimens shall be equal to the casting thickness, \nT. Corrosion test specimens shall be removed from a location \nat one quarter the thickness of the test block. \nS52.3.2 When the thickness of the test block is less than or \nequal to 4 in. [100 mm], test specimens shall show no evidence \nof pitting when examined optically at 20x magnification, and \nhave a weight loss of <4g/m 2 . \nS52.3.3 When the thickness of the test block is greater than \n4 in. [100 mm], test block size and acceptance criteria shall be \nagreed upon between the purchaser and the manufacturer. \n1483 \u2022 ",
