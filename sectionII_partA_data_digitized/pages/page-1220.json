This requirement is to mean \nthe same as the identical requirement that appears in Specifi\u00ad\ncation A20/A20M with respect to steel plate surface finish. \n13. Product Marking \n13.1 The marking shall be stenciled using a suitable heat\u00ad\nresistant paint or metal stamped using low-stress stamps. Wall \nthicknesses under 0.500 in. [13 mm] shall not be metal stamped \nwithout prior approval. The purchaser may specify that mate\u00ad\nrial 0.500 in. [13 mm] and over shall not be metal stamped. \n13.2 In addition to the marking provision of Specification \nA530/A530M, the class marking in accordance with 1.3.3 shall \nfollow the grade marking, for example, 3CR-33. \n13.3 A387/A387M Grade 91 shall additionally be marked \nwith the appropriate Type, 1 or 2, when applicable based on the \nordered specification. \n13.4 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 13.1, \n13.2, and 13.3, bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental \nidentification method. The purchaser may specify in the order \na specific bar coding system to be used. \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nOne or more of the following supplementary requirements shall be applied only when specified by \nthe purchaser in the inquiry, contract, or order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be \nagreed upon in writing by the manufacturer and purchaser, Supplementary requirements shall in no \nway negate any requirement of the specification itself. \nSl. Tension and Bend Tests \nSl.1 Tension tests in accordance with 8.1 and bend tests in \naccordance with 8.2 shall be made on specimens representing \neach length of pipe. \nS2. Charpy V-Notch Test (for pipe with nominal wall thick\u00ad\nness of\u00bd in. [13 mm] and greater) \nS2. l Requirements-The acceptable test energies shall be \nas shown in Table Al.15 of Specification A20/A20M for the \napplicable plate specification unless otherwise stated in the \norder. As an alternative, the test temperature may be 10 \u00b0F [-12 \noq, \nS2.2 Number of Specimens-Each test shall consist of at \nleast three specimens. \nS2.2.1 One base-metal test shall be made from one pipe \nlength per heat, per heat-treat charge, and per nominal wall \nthickness. \nS2.2.2 One weld-metal and one heat-affected zone (HAZ) \nmetal test shall be made in accordance with NB 4335 of \nSection III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. \nS2.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation: \nS2.3.1 Base-metal specimens of stress-relieved, normalized, \nand normalized and tempered pipe shall be taken in accordance \nwith the provisions for tension specimens in the body of this \nspecification. \nS2.3.2 Base-metal specimens of quenched and tempered \npipe shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of NB \n2225 of Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel \nCode. \nS3. Hardness Tests \nS3.1 Hardness determination shall be made on both ends of \neach length of pipe to the parent metal, weld, and the \nheat-affected zone and must meet the hardness requirements in \nTable 1. \nS4. Product Analysis \nS4.1 Product analysis shall be made on each length of pipe. \nIndividual lengths failing to conform to the chemical require\u00ad\nments prescribed in the applicable specification listed in Table \n1 shall be rejected. \nSS. Metallography \nS5.1 The manufacturer shall furnish one photomicrograph \nto show the microstructure at lOOx magnification of the weld \nmetal or base metal of the pipe in the as-finished condition. The \npurchaser shall state in the order: the material, base metal or \nweld, and the number and locations of tests to be made. This \ntest is for information only. \nS6. Magnetic Particle Examination of Base Metal \nS6.1 All accessible surfaces of the pipe shall be examined in \naccordance with Practice E709. Accessible is defined as: All \noutside surfaces, all inside surfaces of pipe 24 in. [600 mm] in \ndiameter and greater, and inside surfaces of pipe less than 24 \nin. [600 mm] in diameter for a distance of one pipe diameter \nfrom the ends. \nS6.2 Butt-weld end preparations are to be completely \n\u2022 magnetic-particle examined in accordance with Practice E709. \nS6.3 Acceptance Standards, shall be by agreement between \nthe manufacturer and the purchaser. \nS7. Magnetic Particle Examinations of Weld Metal \nS7 .1 All accessible welds shall be examined in accordance \nwith Practice E709. Accessible is defined as: All outside \nsurfaces, all inside surfaces of pipe 24 in. [600 mm] in diameter \nand greater, and inside surfaces of pipe less than 24 in. [600 \nmm] in diameter for a distance of one pipe diameter from the \nends. \nS7 .2 Butt-weld end preparations are to be completely \nmagnetic-particle examined in accordance with Practice E709. \n1134 ",
