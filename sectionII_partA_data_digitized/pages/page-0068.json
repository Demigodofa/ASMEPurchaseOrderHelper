  "text": "SA-6/SA-6M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 \nCoil.\" Both test results shall be reported for each qualifying \ncoil, and the location within the coil for each test shall be \nstated. \n14.4 For structural products produced from coil, both the \nmanufacturer and the processor shall be identified on the test \nreport. \n14.5 When full-section test specimens have been used for \nthe qualification of angles, that information shall be stated on \nthe test report. \n14.6 A signature is not required on the test report; however, \nthe document shall clearly identify the organization submitting \nthe report. Notwithstanding the absence of a signature, the \norganization submitting the report is responsible for the content \nof the report. \n14.7 For structural products finished by other than the \noriginal manufacturer, the supplier of the structural product \nshall also provide the purchaser with a copy of the original \nmanufacturer's test report. \n14.8 A test report, certificate of inspection, or similar \ndocument printed from or used in electronic form from an \nelectronic data interchange (EDI) transmission shall be re\u00ad\ngarded as having the same validity as a counterpart printed in \nthe certifier's facility. The content of the EDI transmitted \ndocument shall meet the requirements of the applicable product \nspecification and shall conform to any existing EDI agreement \nbetween the purchaser and the supplier. Notwithstanding the \nabsence of a signature, the organization submitting the EDI \ntransmission shall be responsible for the content of the repmt. \nNoTE 9-The industry definition as invoked here is: EDI is the \ncomputer to computer exchange of business information in a standard \nformat such as ANSI ASC Xl2. \n15. Inspection and Testing \n15.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have \nfree entry, at all times, while work on the contract of the \npurchaser is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's \nworks that concern the manufacture of the structural product \nordered. The manufacturer shall afford the inspector all rea\u00ad\nsonable facilities to be satisfied that the structural product is \nbeing furnished in accordance with this general requirements \nspecification, the applicable product specification, and the \npurchase order. All tests (except product analysis) and inspec\u00ad\ntion shall be made at the place of manufacture prior to \nshipment, unless otherwise specified, and shall be conducted so \nas not to interfere with the operation of the manufacturer's \nworks. \n15.2 Where structural products are produced from coil, 15.1 \nshall apply to the processor instead of the manufacturer, and \nthe place of process shall apply instead of the place of \nmanufacture. Where structural products are produced from coil \nand the processor is different from the manufacturer, the \ninspector representing the purchaser shall have free entry at all \ntimes while work on the contract of the purchaser is being \nperformed to all parts of the manufacturer's works that concern \nthe manufacture of the structural product ordered. \n16 \n16. Retreatment \n16.1 If any heat-treated structural product fails to meet the \nmechanical property requirements of the applicable product \nspecification, the manufacturer or the processor shall have the \noption of heat treating the structural product again. All me\u00ad\nchanical property tests shall be repeated and the structural \nproduct shall be reexamined for surface defects when it is \nresubmitted for inspection. \n17. Rejection \n17 .1 Any rejection based upon product analysis made in \naccordance with the applicable product specification shall be \nreported to the supplier and samples that represent the rejected \nstructural product shall be preserved for two weeks from the \ndate of notification of such rejection. In case of dissatisfaction \nwith the results of the tests, the supplier shall have the option \nof making claim for a rehearing within that time. \n17.2 The purchaser shall have the option of rejecting struc\u00ad\ntural product that exhibits injurious defects subsequent to its \nacceptance at the manufacturer's or processor's works, and so \nnotifying the manufacturer or processor. \n18. Identification of Structural Products \n18.1 Required Plate Markings: \n18.1.1 Except as allowed by 18.1.4.2 and 18.6, plates shall \nbe legibly marked with the following: applicable ASTM \ndesignation (see 1.1) (year-date not required); \"G\" or \"MT\" if \napplicable (see 18.1.2); applicable grade; heat number; size and \nthickness; and name, brand, or trademark of the manufacturer \n(for plates produced from an as-rolled structural product) or the \nprocessor (for plates produced from coil). \n18.1.2 Plates that are required to be heat treated, but have \nnot been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the manufacturer \nor processor, with the letter \"G\" (denoting green) following the \nrequired ASTM designation mark, except that \"G\" marking is \nnot necessary if such plates are for shipment, for the purpose of \nobtaining the required heat treatment, to an organization under \nthe manufacturer's control. Such plates shall have been quali\u00ad\nfied for shipment on the basis of test specimens that have been \nso heat treated. Plates that are required to be heat treated, and \nhave been so heat treated, shall be marked, by the party that \nperformed the heat treatment, with the letter \"MT\" (denoting \nmaterial treated) following the required ASTM designation \nmark. \n18.1.3 Except as allowed by 18.1.4.2 and 18.6, the required \nmarkings for plates shall be by steel die stamping, paint \nmarking, or by means of permanently affixed, colorfast, \nweather-resistant labels or tags. It shall be the responsibility of \nthe supplier that all required markings be intact and fully \nlegible upon receipt by the purchaser. \n18.1.4 Location of Markings: \n18.1.4.1 The required markings for plates shall be in at least \none place on each finished plate. \n18.1.4.2 For secured lifts of all sizes of plates 3/s in. [10 mm] \n(or 5 /16 in. [8 mm] for material specified for bridge construction \nend use) or under in thickness, and for secured lifts of all \nthicknesses of plates 36 in. [900 mm] or under in width, the \nmanufacturer or processor shall have the option of placing such ",
