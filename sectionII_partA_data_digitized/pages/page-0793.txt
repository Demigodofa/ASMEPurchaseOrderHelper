where: 
P = hydrostatic test pressure, psi or MPa, 
t = specified wall thickness, in. or mm, and 
D = specified outside diameter, in. or mm. 
24.1.1 The hydrostatic test pressure determined by Eq 3 
shall be rounded to the nearest 50 psi [0.5 MPa] for pressure 
below 1000 psi [7 MPa], and to the nearest 100 psi [1 MPa] for 
pressures 1000 psi [7 MPa] and above. The hydrostatic test 
may be performed prior to cutting to final length, or prior to 
upsetting, swaging, expanding, bending or other forming 
operations, or both. 
24.2 Regardless of the determination made by Eq 3, the 
minimum hydrostatic test pressure required to satisfy these 
requirements need not exceed the values given in Table 7. This 
does not prohibit testing at higher pressures at manufacturer's 
option or as provided in 24.3. 
24.3 With concurrence of the manufacturer, a minimum 
hydrostatic test pressure in excess of the requirements of 24.2 
or 24.1, or both, may be stated on the order. The tube wall 
stress shall be determined by the following equation: 
S = PD/2t (4) 
where: 
S = tube wall stress, psi or MPa, and all other symbols as 
defined in 24.1.1. 
24.4 The test pressure shall be held for a minimum of 5 s. 
24.5 If any tube shows leaks during the hydrostatic test, it 
shall be rejected. 
24.6 The hydrostatic test may not be capable of testing the 
end po11ion of the pipe. The lengths of pipe that cannot be 
tested shall be determined by the manufacturer and, when 
specified in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
25. Air Pressure Test 
25.1 Air Underwater Test-When this test is employed, 
each tube, with internal surface clean and dry, shall be 
internally pressurized to 150 psi [1000 kPa] minimum with 
clean and dry compressed air while being submerged in clear 
water. The tube shall be well-lighted, preferably by underwater 
illumination. Any evidence of air leakage of the pneumatic 
couplings shall be corrected prior to testing. Inspection shall be 
made of the entire external surface of the tube after holding the 
pressure for not less than 5 s after the surface of the water has 
become calm. If any tube shows leakage during the air

25.2 Pneumatic Leak Test-When this test is employed, 
each tube shall be subjected to a pneumatic leak test in 
accordance with Specification A1047/A1047M.

26.1 When nondestructive examination is specified by the 
purchaser or the product specification, each tube shall be 
examined by a nondestructive examination method in accor­
dance with Practice E213, Practice E309 (for ferromagnetic 
materials), Practice E426 (for non-magnetic materials), or 
Practice E570. Upon agreement, Practice E273 shall be em­
ployed in addition to one of the full periphery tests. The range 
of tube sizes that may be examined by each method shall be 
subject to the limitations in the scope of that practice. In case 
of conflict between these methods and practices and this 
specification, the requirements of this specification shall pre­
vail.

26.2 The following information is for the benefit of the user 
of this specification. 
26.2.1 Calibration standards for the nondestructive electric 
test are convenient standards for calibration of nondestructive 
testing equipment only. For several reasons, including shape, 
orientation, width, etc., the correlation between the signal 
produced in the electric test from an imperfection and from 
calibration standards is only approximate. A purchaser inter­
ested in ascertaining the nature (type, size, location, and 
orientation) of discontinuities that can be detected in the 
specific application of these examinations should discuss this 
with the manufacturer of the tubular product. 
26.2.2 The ultrasonic examination refe1Ted to in this speci­
fication is intended to detect longitudinal discontinuities having 
a reflective area similar to or larger than the calibration 
reference notches specified in 26.4. The examination may not 
detect circumferentially oriented impelfections or short, deep 
defects. 
26.2.3 The eddy current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
discontinuities, especially of the sh011 abrupt type. Practices 
E309 and E426 contain additional information regarding the 
capabilities and limitations of eddy-current examination. 
26.2.4 The flux leakage examination referred to in this 
specification is capable of detecting the presence and location 
of significant longitudinally or transversely oriented disconti­
nuities. The provisions of this specification only provide for 
longitudinal calibration for flux leakage. It should be recog­
nized that different techniques should be employed to detect 
differently oriented imperfections. 
26.2.5 The hydrostatic test referred to in Section 23 is a test 
method provided for in many product specifications. This test 
has the capability of finding defects of a size permitting the test
