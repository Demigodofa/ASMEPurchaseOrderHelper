SA-370 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
18.3 Test Blocks-Machines should be checked to make 
certain they are in good order by means of standardized 
Rockwell test blocks. 
18 .4 Detailed Procedure-For detailed requirements of this 
test, reference shall be made to the latest revision of Test 
Methods E18. 
19. Portable Hardness Test 
19.1 Although this standard generally prefers the use of 
fixed-location Brinell or Rockwell hardness test methods, it is 
not always possible to perform the hardness test using such 
equipment due to the part size, location, or other logistical 
reasons. In this event, hardness testing using portable equip­
ment as desc1ibed in Test Methods A956/A956M, A1038, and 
Ell0 shall be used with strict compliance for rep01ting the test 
results in accordance with the selected standard (see examples 
below). 
19.1.1 Practice A833-The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
given the HBC designation followed by the comparative test 
bar hardness to indicate that it was determined by a portable 
comparative hardness tester, as in the following example: 
19.1.1.1 232 HBC/240, where 232 is the hardness test result 
using the portable comparative test method (HBC) and 240 is 
the Brinell hardness of the comparative test bar. 
19.1.2 Test Method A956/A956M: 
19 .1.2.1 The measured hardness number shall be reported in 
accordance with the standard methods and appended with a 
Leeb impact device in parenthesis to indicate that it was 
determined by a portable hardness tester, as in the following 
example: 
( 1) 350 HLD where 350 is the hardness test result using the 
p01table Leeb hardness test method with the HLD impact 
device. 
19.1.2.2 When hardness values converted from the Leeb 
number are reported, the portable instrument used shall be 
reported in parentheses, for example: 
(1) 350 HB (HLD) where the original hardness test was 
performed using the portable Leeb hardness test method with 
the HLD impact device and converted to the Brinell hardness 
value (HB). 
19 .1.3 Test Method Al 038-The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
appended with UCI in parenthesis to indicate that it was 
determined by a portable hardness tester, as in the following 
example: 
19.l.3.l 446 HV (UC!) 10 where 446 is the hardness test 
result using the portable UCI test method under a force of 
10 kgf. 
19.1.4 Test Method Ell0-The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
appended with a IP to indicate that it was determined by a 
portable hardness tester, as follows: 
19.1.4.1 Rockwell Hardness Examples: 
( 1) 40 HRCIP where 40 is the hardness test result using the 
Rockwell C portable test method. 
602 
(2) 72 HRBWIP where 72 is the hardness test result using 
the Rockwell B portable test method using a tungsten carbide 
ball indenter. 
19.1.4.2 Brinell Hardness Examples: 
( 1) 220 HBWIP 10/3000 where 220 is the hardness test 
result using the Brinell portable test method with a ball of 
10 mm diameter and with a test force of 3000 kgf (29.42 kN) 
applied for 10 to 15 s. 
(2) 350 HBW/P 5/750 where 350 is the hardness test result 
using the Brinell portable test method with a ball of 5 mm 
diameter and with a test force of 750 kgf (7.355 kN) applied for 
10 to 15 s. 
CHARPY IMPACT TESTING 
20. Summary 
20.1 A Charpy V-notch impact test is a dynamic test in 
which a notched specimen is struck and broken by a single 
blow in a specially designed testing machine. The measured 
test values may be the energy absorbed, the percentage shear 
fracture, the lateral expansion opposite the notch, or a combi­
nation thereof. 
20.2 Testing temperatures other than room (ambient) tem­
perature often are specified in product or general requirement 
specifications (hereinafter referred to as the specification). 
Although the testing temperature is sometimes related to the 
expected service temperature, the two temperatures need not be 
identical. 
21. Significance and Use 
21.1 Ductile Versus Brittle Behavior-Body-centered-cubic 
or ferritic alloys exhibit a significant transition in behavior 
when impact tested over a range of temperatures. At tempera­
tures above transition, impact specimens fracture by a ductile 
(usually microvoid coalescence) mechanism, absorbing rela­
tively large amounts of energy. At lower temperatures, they 
fracture in a brittle (usually cleavage) manner absorbing 
appreciably less energy. Within the transition range, the frac­
ture will generally be a mixture of areas of ductile fracture and 
brittle fracture. 
21.2 The temperature range of tlle transition from one type 
of behavior to the other varies according to the material being 
tested. This transition behavior may be defined in various ways 
for specification purposes. 
21.2.1 The specification may require a minimum test result 
for absorbed energy, fracture appearance, lateral expansion, or 
a combination thereof, at a specified test temperature. 
21.2.2 The specification may require the determination of 
the transition temperature at which eitller the absorbed energy 
or fracture appearance attains a specified level when testing is 
performed over a range of temperatures. Alternatively the 
specification may require the detennination of tlle fracture 
appearance transition temperature (FATTn) as the temperature 
at which the required minimum percentage of shear fracture (n) 
is obtained.

testing appears in Annex AS.
