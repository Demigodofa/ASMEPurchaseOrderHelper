31.4 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 31.1 -
31.3, the manufacturer shall have the option of using bar 
coding as a supplementary identification method. Bar coding 
should be consistent with the (AIAG) standard prepared by the 
Primary Metals Subcommittee of the AIAG Bar Code Project 
Team. 
32. Packaging, Marking, and Loading 
32.1 When specified on the purchase order, packaging, 
marking, and loading for shipment shall be in accordance with 
the procedures of Practices A 700. 
33. Government Procurement 
33.1 Scale Free Tube: 
33.1.1 When specified in the contract or order, the following 
requirements shall be considered in the inquiry contract or 
order, for agencies of the U.S. Government where scale-free 
tube is required. These requirements shall take precedence if 
there is a conflict between these requirements and the product 
specification. 
33.1.2 Tube shall be ordered to outside diameter (OD) and 
wall thickness. 
33.1.3 Responsibility for Inspection-Unless otherwise 
specified in the contract or purchase order, the manufacturer is 
responsible for the performance of all inspection and test 
requirements specified. The absence of any inspection require­
ments in the specification shall not relieve the contractor of the 
responsibility for ensuring that all products or supplies submit­
ted to the government for acceptance comply with all require­
ments of the contract. Sampling inspection, as part of the 
manufacturing operations, is an acceptable practice to ascertain 
conformance to requirements; however, this does not authorize 
submission of known defective material, either indicated or 
actual, nor does it commit the government to accept the 
material. Except as otherwise specified in the contract or 
purchase order, the manufacturer may use his own or any other 
suitable facilities for the performance of the inspection and test 
requirements unless disapproved by the purchaser at the time 
the order is placed. The purchaser shall have the right to 
perform any of the inspections and tests set forth when such 
inspections and tests are deemed necessary to ensure that the 
material conforms to the prescribed requirements. 
33.1.4 Sampling for Flattening and Flaring Test and for 
Visual and Dimensional Examination-Minimum sampling for 
flattening and flaring tests and visual and dimensional exami­
nation shall be as follows: 
Lot Size (pieces per lot) Sample Size 
2 to 8 Entire lot 
9 to 90 8 
91 to 150 12 
151 to 280 19 
~1~WO ~ 
501 to 1200 27 
1201 to 3200 35 
3201 to 10 ooo 38 
10 001 to 35 ooo 46 
In all cases, the acceptance number is zero and the rejection 
number is one. Rejected lots may be screened and resubmitted 
for visual and dimensional examination. All defective items 
shall be replaced with acceptable items prior to lot acceptance. 
33.1.5 Sampling for Chemical Analysis-One sample for 
chemical analysis shall be selected from each of two tubes 
chosen from each lot. A lot shall be all material poured from 
one heat. 
33.1.6 Sampling for Tension and Bend Test-One sample 
shall be taken from each lot. A lot shall consist of all tube of the 
same outside diameter and wall thickness manufactured during 
an 8-h shift from the same heat of steel, and heat treated under 
the same conditions of temperature and time in a single charge 
in a batch type furnace, or heat treated under the same 
condition in a continuous furnace, and presented for inspection 
at the same time. 
33.1.7 Hydrostatic and Ultrasonic Tests-Each tube shall be 
tested by the ultrasonic (when specified) and hydrostatic tests. 
33.1.8 Tube shall be free from heavy oxide or scale. The 
internal surface of hot finished ferritic steel tube shall be 
pickled or blast cleaned to a free of scale condition equivalent 
to the CSa2 visual standard listed in SSPC-SP6. Cleaning shall 
be performed in accordance with a written procedure that has 
been shown to be effective. This procedure shall be available 
for audit. 
33.1.9 In addition to the marking in Specification A530/ 
A530M, each length of tube ¼ in. outside diameter and larger 
shall be marked with the following listed information. Marking 
shall be in accordance with FED-STD-183 and MIL-STD- 792: 
(a) Outside diameter, wall thickness, and length (b) Heat or lot 
identification number. 
33.1.10 Tube shall be straight to within the tolerances 
specified in Table 7.

33.1.11 When specified, each tube shall be ultrasonically 
examined in accordance with MIL-STD-271, except that the 
notch depth in the calibration standard shall be 5 % of the wall 
thickness or 0.005 in., whichever is greater. Any tube that 
produces an indication equal to or greater than 100 % of the 
indication from the calibration standard shall be rejected. 
33.1.12 The tube shall be free from repair welds, welded 
joints, laps, laminations, seams, visible cracks, tears, grooves, 
slivers, pits, and other imperfections detrimental to the tube as 
determined by visual and ultrasonic examination, or alternate 
tests, as specified. 
33.1.13 Tube shall be uniform in quality and condition and 
have a finish conforming to the best practice for standard 
quality tubing. Surface imperfections such as handling marks, 
straightening marks, light mandrel and die marks, shallow pits, 
and scale pattern will not be considered injurious if the 
imperfections are removable within the tolerances specified for 
wall thickness or 0.005 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. The
