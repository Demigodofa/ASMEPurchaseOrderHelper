A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1. 1 This specification 2 covers seamless ferritic and auste\u00ad\nnitic steel boiler, superheater, and heat-exchanger tubes, des\u00ad\nignated Grades TS, TP304, etc. These steels are listed in Tables \n1 and 2. \n1.2 Grades containing the letter, H, in their designation, \nhave requirements different from those of similar grades not \ncontaining the letter, H. These different requirements provide \nhigher creep-rupture strength than normally achievable in \nsimilar grades without these different requirements. \n1.3 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to \nthis specification are 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter to 5 in. \n[127 mm] in outside diameter and 0.015 to 0.500 in. [0.4 to \n12.7 mm], inclusive, in minimum wall thickness or, if specified \nin the order, average wall thickness. Tubing having other \ndiameters may be furnished, provided such tubes comply with \nall other requirements of this specification. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \nl.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee A0l on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.10 on Stainless and Alloy Steel Tubular Products. \nCurrent edition approved May 1, 2023. Published June 2023. Originally \napproved in 1939. Last previous edition approved in 2022 as A213/A213M - 22a. \nDOI: 10.1520/A0213_A0213M-23. \n2 For ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code applications see related Specifi\u00ad\ncation SA-213 in Section II of that Code. \n2.
