Scope \n1. l This specification covers several grades, designated Tl, \nTla, Tlb, T2, Tll, Tl2 and T22, of minimum-wall-thickness, \nelectric-resistance-welded, carbon-molybdenum and \nchromium-molybdenum alloy-steel, boiler and superheater \ntubes. \n1.2 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to \nthis specification are \u00bd to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside \ndiameter and 0.035 to 0.320 in. [0.9 to 8.1 mm], inclusive, in \nminimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may \nbe furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other \nrequirements of this specification. \n1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to \ntubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 \nin. [0.4 mm] in thickness. \n1.4 An optional supplementary requirement is provided for \nnon-destructive examination for certain ASME applications. \n1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be reaagrded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n1.5.1 Within the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. \n1.5.2 The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \n368 \nA1016/Al016M Specification for General Requirements for \nFerritic Alloy Steel, Austenitic Alloy Steel, and Stainless \nSteel Tubes \nE213 Practice for Ultrasonic Testing of Metal Pipe and \nTubing \nE273 Practice for Ultrasonic Testing of the Weld Zone of \nWelded Pipe and Tubing \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for material under this specification should \ninclude the following, as required, to describe the desired \nmaterial adequately: \n3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), \n3.1.2 Name of material (electric-resistance-welded tubes), \n3.1.3 Grade (Table 1), \n3.1.4 Size (outside diameter or minimum wall thickness), \n3.1.5 Length (specific or random), \n3.1.6 Optional requirement (7.3.6), \n3.1.7 Test report required (see Certification Section of \nSpecification Al016/Al016M), \n3.1.8 Specification designation, and . \n3.1.9 Special requirements and any supplementary require\u00ad\nments selected. \n4. General Requirements \n4.1 Product furnished under this specification shall conform \nto the applicable requirements of Specification Al016/ \nAl016M, including any supplementary requirements that are \nindicated in the purchase order. Failure to comply with the \ngeneral requirements of Specification A1016/A1016M consti\u00ad\ntutes nonconformance with this specification. In case of con\u00ad\nflicts with the requirements of this specification and Specifi\u00ad\ncation Al016/Al016M, this specification shall prevail. \n5. Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 The steel shall be killed. \n5.2 The tubes shall be made by electric-resistance welding. \n5.3 Heat Treatment \n5.3.1 After welding, or when cold finished, after the final \ncold-drawing pass, all tubes shall be heat treated and, except as \nprovided in 5.3.2, furnished in the full annealed, isothermal \nannealed, normalized, or normalized and tempered condition at ",
