SA-334/SA-334M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR SEAMLESS AND WELDED 
CARBON AND ALLOY-STEEL TUBES FOR LOW­
TEMPERATURE SERVICE 
SA-334/SA-334M cO 
INTERNATIONAL 
Standards Worldwide 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 334/ A 334M-04a(2016).] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers several grades of mini­
mum-wall-thickness, seamless and welded, carbon and 
alloy-steel tubes intended for use at low temperatures. 
Some product sizes may not be available under this speci­
fication because heavier wall thicknesses have an adverse 
affect on low-temperature impact properties. 
1.2 Supplementary Requirement S 1 of an optional 
nature is provided. This shall apply only when specified 
by the purchaser. 
NOTE 1 - For tubing smaller than ½ in. [12. 7 mm] in outside diameter, 
the elongation values given for strip specimens in Table 1 shall apply. 
Mechanical property requirements do not apply to tubing smaller than ½ 
in. [3.2 mm] in outside diameter and with a wall thickness under O.QlS 
in. [0.4 mm]. 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification. The inch-pound units shall apply 
unless the "M" designation of this specification is specified 
in the order.

4. General Requirements 
4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall 
conform to the applicable requirements of the current edi­
tion of Specification A 1016/ A 1016M, unless otherwise 
provided herein. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 The tubes shall be made by the seamless or auto­
matic welding process with no addition of filler metal in 
the welding operation.
