Scope \n1.1 This specification covers hot-finished or cold-fin\u00ad\nished precipitation hardening iron base superalloy bars, \nforgings, and forging stock for high-temperature service. \nThe mechanical properties of these alloys are developed \nby suitable solution treating and precipitation hardening \ntreatments. \n1.2 Two grades of iron base alloy are covered. Selection \nwill depend upon design, service conditions, mechanical \nproperties, and elevated temperature characteristics. \n1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \n(metric) units are to be regarded separately as standards; \nwithin the text and tables, the SI units are shown in [brack\u00ad\nets]. The values stated in each system are not exact equiva\u00ad\nlents; therefore, each system must be used independent of \nthe other. Combining values from the two systems may \nresult in nonconformance with the specification. \n1.4 Unless the order specifies an \"M\" designation, the \nmaterial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA 484/ A 484M Specification for General Requirements \nfor Stainless Steel Bars, Billets, and Forgings \nA 751 Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology for \nChemical Analysis of Steel Products \nE 30 Test Methods for Chemical Analysis of Steel, Cast \nIron, Open-Hearth Iron, and Wrought Iron \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify \nall requirements that are necessary for material ordered \nunder this specification. Such requirements may include, \nbut are not limited to, the following: \n3.1.1 . Quantity (weight or number of pieces). \n3.1.2 Name of material (precipitation hardening iron \nbase superalloy). \n3.1.3 Form (bars, forgings, and forging stock). \n3.1.4 Dimensions (in the case of rough or finished \nforgings the order shall be accompanied by a print or \ndrawing or otherwise adequately described as to the shape \nand dimension). \n3.1.5 Grade designation (Table 1). \n3.1.6 Condition (Section 5). \n3.1.7 Finish (Section 3). \n3.1.8 Mechanical requirements (Section 8). \n3.1.9 ASTM designation. \n3.1.10 Special requirements. \n4. General Requirements \n4.1 In addition to the requirements of this specification, \nall requirements of the current edition of Specification \nA 484/A 484M shall apply. Failure to comply with the \ngeneral requirements of Specification A 484 / A 484M con\u00ad\nstitutes nonconformance with this specification. \n5. Condition \n5.1 The product forms covered in this specification \nmay be furnished in one of the following conditions: \n5.1.1 Hot-finished. \n5.1.2 Solution treated (Grade 660 only - Type 1 \nor Type 2 solution treatment as specified). \n1052 ",
