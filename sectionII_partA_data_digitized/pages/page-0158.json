Such a steel is identified by inserting the letter \"L\" between \nthe second and third numerals of the grade designation, for example, 10 L 45. A cast or heat analysis is not determinable when lead is added to the ladle stream. \n\"When boron treatment for killed steels is specified, the steels can be expected to contain 0.0005 to 0.003 % boron. If the usual titanium additive is not permitted, the \nsteels can be expected to contain up to 0.005 % boron. \nFThe elements bismuth, calcium, selenium, or tellurium may be added as agreed upon between purchaser and supplier. \nG Unless prohibited by the purchaser, the manganese content may exceed 0.60 % on heat analysis to a maximum of 0.75 %, provided the carbon range on heat analysis \nhas the minimum and maximum reduced by 0.01 % for each 0.05 % manganese over 0.60 %. \ndetermined in accordance with Test Methods El12. Confor\u00ad\nmance to this grain size of 70 % of the grains in the area \nexamined shall constitute the basis of acceptance. One test per \nheat shall be made. \n5.1.2 When a fine austenitic grain size is specified, the steel \nshall have a grain size number of 5 or higher as determined in \naccordance with Test Methods El12. Conformance to this \ngrain size of 70 % of the area examined shall constitute the \nbasis of acceptance. One test per heat shall be made unless the \nprovisions of 5.1.2.1 or 5.1.2.2 are exercised. \n5.1.2.1 When aluminum is used as the grain refining \nelement, the fine austenitic grain size requirement shall be \ndeemed to be fulfilled if, on heat analysis, the aluminum \ncontent is not less than 0.020 % total aluminum or, alternately, \n0.015 % acid soluble aluminum. The aluminum content shall \nbe reported. The grain size test specified in 5.1.2 shall be the \nreferee test. \n106 \n5.1.2.2 By agreement between purchaser and supplier, co\u00ad\nlumbium or vanadium, or both, may be used for grain refining \ninstead of or with aluminum. When columbium or vanadium is \nused as a grain refining element, the fine austenitic grain size \nrequirement shall be deemed to be fulfilled if, on heat analysis, \nthe columbium or vanadium content is as follows (the content \nof the elements shall be reported with the heat analysis): \nSteels having 0.25 % carbon or less: \nCb 0.025 min \nV 0.05 min \nSteels having over 0.25 % carbon: \nCb 0.Q15 min \nV 0.02 min ",
