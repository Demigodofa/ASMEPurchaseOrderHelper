When ordered as \n\"annealed last,\" the product will have coil breaks and a \ntendency toward fluting and stretcher straining. Unexposed \ncold-rolled sheet may contain more surface imperfections than \nexposed cold-rolled sheet because steel applications, process\u00ad\ning procedures, and inspection standards are less stringent. \n9.4 Cold-rolled high-strength low-alloy sheet is supplied \nwith a matte finish, unless otherwise specified. \n9.5 The cold-rolled products covered by this specification \nare furnished with cut edges and square cut ends, unless \notherwise specified. \n984 \n-___________, ",
