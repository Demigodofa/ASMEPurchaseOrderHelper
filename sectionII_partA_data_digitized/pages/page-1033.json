Alternative Location for Mechanical Testing \nS53.1 When specified by the purchaser, the axis of the \ntensile and impact test specimens shall come from the mid\u00ad\nthickness of each plate tested, in lieu of midway between the \ncenter thickness and the top or bottom surface of the plate. \nS62. Temper Embrittlement Factor \nS62.1 The composition of the steel, based on heat analysis, \nshall be restricted in accordance with the following equations: \nJ = (Si+Mn) X(P+Sn) X 104:5150 (Si, Mn, P, and Sn in wt%) \nCn:5 0.20% \nNi:5 0.30% \nS62.1.1 Lower values of J, Cu, and Ni can be specified by \nagreement between purchaser and the supplier. \nS62.1.2 When so specified by the purchaser, the maximum \nvalue of J shall not exceed 100. \nS62.1.3 The values of J shall be reported. \nS62.1.4 If the plates are repaired by welding, the composi\u00ad\ntion of the weld deposit shall be restricted in accordance with \nthe following equations: \nX = (IOP+ 5Sb+4Sn+ As)/100 :5 15 (P, Sb, Sn, and As in ppm) \nCu :5 0.20% \nNi:5 0.30% \nS62.1.5 The values of X shall be reported. \nS63. Impact Properties After Step Cooling \nS63.1 The Charpy V-notch impact properties shall be deter\u00ad\nmined as follows: \nS63.1.1 A suffi.cient amount of Charpy V-notch test speci\u00ad\nmens shall be taken from the same location from a plate from \neach heat of steel to construct two transition temperature \ncurves. \nS63 .1.2 The test specimens for one transition temperature \nS63.2 The test specimens for the other transition tempera\u00ad\nture curve shall be given the PWHT cycle specified in S63.1.2 \nplus the following step cooling heat treatment: \nHold at 1100\u00b0F (593\u00b0C) for 1 h, then cool at 10\u00b0F (5.6\u00b0C)/h \nto 1000\u00b0F (538\u00b0C). \nHold at 1000\u00b0F (538\u00b0C) for 15 h, then cool at 10\u00b0F (5.6\u00b0C)/h \nto 975\u00b0F (524\u00b0C). \nHold at 975\u00b0F (524\u00b0C) for 24 h, then cool at 10\u00b0F (5.6\u00b0C)/h \nto 925\u00b0F (496\u00b0C). \nHold at 925\u00b0F (496\u00b0C) for 60 h, then cool at 5\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C)/h \nto 875\u00b0F (468\u00b0C). \nHold at 875\u00b0F (468\u00b0C) for 100 h, then cool at 50\u00b0F \n(27.8\u00b0C)/h to 600\u00b0F (315\u00b0C). \nCoo 1 in still air. \nS63.3 Test the Charpy V-notch test specimens in accordance \nwith Test Methods and Definitions A370 to determine the 40 \nft-lbs (55 J) transition temperature from each transition tem\u00ad\nperature curve using a set of three test specimens at each test \ntemperature. The test temperatures shall include tests on the \nupper and lower shelves and a minimum of four intermediate \ntemperatures. \nS63.4 The following requirements shall be met. \nwhere: \nvTr40 (vTr55) \nL'wTr40 (~vTr55) \nvTr40+ 2.5LwTr40 :5 50\u00b0F \nvTr55 + 2.51'.i vTr55 :5 10\u00b0 C \n= the 40 ft-lbs (55 J) transition tempera\u00ad\nture of the material subjected to the \nminimum PWHT specified by the pur\u00ad\nchaser. \n= the shift of the 40 ft-lbs (55 J) transition \ntemperature the of the step cooled ma\u00ad\nterial.
