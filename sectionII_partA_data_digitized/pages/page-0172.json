Scope \n1.1 This specification covers steel rivets for use in \nboilers and pressure vessels and steel bars for use in the \nmanufacture of rivets. \n1.2 Two grades are covered: \n1~2.1 Grade A - Bars having a yield point of \n23 000 psi (160 MPa) minimum with no controls on carbon \ncontent. \n1.2.2 Grade B - Bars having a yield point of \n29 000 psi (200 MPa) minimum with carbon 0.28% \nmaximum. \n1.2.3 Rivets are manufactured from the applicable \nbar grade. \n1.3 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be \nregarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses \nare for information only. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA 29 I A 29M Specification for Steel Bars, Carbon and \nAlloy, Hot-Wrought, General Requirements for \nA 370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Test\u00ad\ning of Steel Products \nA 751 Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology for \nChemical Analysis of Steel Products \nF 1470 Guide for Fastener Sampling for Specified Mechan\u00ad\nical Properties and Performance Inspection \n2.2 ASME Standards: \nB 18.1.1 Small Solid Rivets \u00bd 6 Inch Nominal Diameter and \nSmaller \nB 18 .1.2 Large Rivets \u00bd Inch Nominal Diameter and Larger \nB18.24 Part Identifying Number (PIN) Code System Stan\u00ad\ndard for B 18 Fastener Products \n120 \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for rivets and bars under this specification \nshall include: \n3.1.1 Specification designation and date of issue, \n3.1.2 Quantity - Number of pieces for rivets and \nweight for bars, \n3.1.3 Name of product and grade (A or B), \n3.1.4 Size ( diameter and length), \n3.1.5 Rivet head type, \n3.1.6 If inspection at point of manufacture is \nrequired, \n3.1.7 DELETED \n3.1.8 Additional testing or special requirements, if \nrequired. \n3.1.9 For establishment of a part identifying system, \nsee ASME Bl8.24. \nNOTE 1-A typical ordering description is: ASME SA-31, 2015 edition, \n10 000 pieces, steel rivets Grade A, button head. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 The steel shall be made by any of the following \nprocesses: open-hearth, electric-furnace, or basic-oxygen. \n4.2 Rivets shall be manufactured from rivet bars con\u00ad\nforming to the applicable grade ordered. \n4.3 Rivets shall be manufactured by hot- or cold\u00ad\nheading. \n4.4 Bars shall be furnished as rolled and not pickled, \nblast cleaned, or oiled. At producer's option, bars may be \ncleaned for inspection or cold drawn. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 The steel shall conform to chemical composition \nprescribed in Table l. ",
