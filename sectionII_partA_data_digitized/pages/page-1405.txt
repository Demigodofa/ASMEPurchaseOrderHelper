~vTr40 (~vTr55) = the shift of the 40-ft-lbs (55 J) transition 
temperature the of the step cooled ma­
terial. (The 40-ft-lbs (55 J) transition 
temperature the of the step cooled ma­
terial minus that of the material sub­
jected to the minimum PWHT only). 
S63.5 The 40-ft-lbs (55 J) transition temperatures for the 
two material conditions shall be reported. (Fig. S 1.1)
