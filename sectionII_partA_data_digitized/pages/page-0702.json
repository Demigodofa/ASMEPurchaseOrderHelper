S62 and S63 \nare applicable for Grades 22 and 21 only. \nS53. Alternative Location for Mechanical Testing \nWhen specified by the purchaser, the axis of the tensile and \nimpact test specimens shall come from the mid-thickness of \neach plate tested, in lieu of midway between the center \nthickness and the top or bottom surface of the plate. \nS60. Restricted Carbon \nS60.1 The maximum carbon content of Grade 5 shall be \n0.10%. \nS62. Temper Embrittlement Factor \nS62.l The composition of the steel, based on heat analysis, \nshall be restricted in accordance with the following equations: \nJ (Si+Mn)X(P+Sn)Xl0 4 ::Sl50 (Si,Mn,PandSninwt%) \nCus 0.20% \nNiS 0.30% \nS62.1.1 Lower values of J, Cu, and Ni can be specified by \nagreement between purchaser and the supplier. \nS62.1.2 When so specified by the purchaser, the maximum \nvalue of J shall not exceed 100. \nS62.1.3 The values of J shall be reported. \nS62.1.4 If the plates are repaired by welding, the composi\u00ad\ntion of the weld deposit shall be restricted in accordance with \nthe following equations: \nX = (10P+5Sb+4Sn+As)/I00s 15 (P, Sb, SnandAsinppm) \nCu::S 0.20% \nNiS 0.30% \nS62.1.5 The values of X shall be reported. \nS63. Impact Properties After Step Cooling \nS63.1 The Charpy V-notch impact properties shall be deter\u00ad\nmined as follows: \nS63.1.l A sufficient amount of Charpy V-notch test speci\u00ad\nmens shall be taken from the same location from a plate from \neach heat of steel to construct two transition temperature \ncurves. \n652 \nS63 .1.2 The test specimens for one transition temperature \ncurve shall be given the minimum post weld heat treatment \n(PWHT) cycle specified by the purchaser. \nS63.2 The test specimens for the other transition tempera\u00ad\nture curve shall be given the PWHT cycle specified in S63.1.2 \nplus the following step cooling heat treatment: \nHold at l100\u00b0F (593\u00b0C) for 1 h, then cool at 10\u00b0F (5.6\u00b0C)/h \nto 1000\u00b0F (538\u00b0C). \nHold at 1000\u00b0F (538\u00b0C) for 15 h, then cool at l0\u00b0F (5.6\u00b0C)/h \nto 975\u00b0F (524\u00b0C). \nHold at 975\u00b0F (524\u00b0C) for 24 h, then cool at 10\u00b0F (5.6\u00b0C)/h \nto 925\u00b0F (496\u00b0C). \nHold at 925\u00b0F (496\u00b0C) for 60 h, then cool at 5\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C)/h \nto 875\u00b0F ( 468\u00b0C). \nHold at 875\u00b0F (468\u00b0C) for 100 h, then cool at 50\u00b0F \n(27.8\u00b0C)/h to 600\u00b0F (315\u00b0C). \nCool in still air. \nS63.3 Test the Charpy V-notch test specimens in accordance \nwith Test Methods and Definitions A370 to determine the 40 \nft-lbs (55 J) transition temperature from each transition tem\u00ad\nperature curve using a set of three test specimens at each test \ntemperature. The test temperatures shall include tests on the \nupper and lower shelves and a minimum of four intermediate \ntemperatures. \nS63.4 The following requirements shall be met. \nwhere: \nvTr40+ 2.5Li vTr40 s 50\u00b0F \nvTr55+2.5LivTr55 s 10\u00b0C \nvTr40 (vTr55) = the 40 ft-lbs (55 J) transition tempera-\nture of the material subjected to the \nminimum PWHT specified by the pur\u00ad\nchaser. \n~vTr40 (~vTr55) = the shift of the 40 ft-lbs (55 J) transition \ntemperature the of the step cooled ma\u00ad\nterial. (The 40 ft-lbs (55 J) transition \ntemperature the of the step cooled ma\u00ad\nterial minus that of the material sub\u00ad\njected to the minimum PWHT only). \nS63.5 The 40 ft-lbs (55 J) transition temperatures for the \ntwo material conditions shall be reported.
