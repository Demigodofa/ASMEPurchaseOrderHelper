the option of the manufacturer. If furnished in the normalized 
and tempered condition, the minimum tempering temperature 
shall be 1200 °P [650 °C], except T22 shall be tempered at 
1250 °P [676 °C] minimum. 
5.3.2 When grades Tl, Tia, Tlb, and T2 are cold finished, 
the tubes may, at the option of the manufacturer, be heat treated 
after the final cold-drawing pass at a temperature of 1200 °P or 
higher, provided one of the heat treatments specified in 5.3.1 
was applied after welding. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements given in 
Table l. 
6.2 Product Analysis 
6.2.l An analysis of either one length of flat-rolled stock or 
one tube shall be made on each heat. The chemical composition 
thus determined shall conform to the requirements given in 
Table 1. 
6.2.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be 
made. Both retests for the elements in question shall meet the 
requirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot (See 8.1) shall be rejected or, at the 
option of the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or tube 
may be individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat­
rolled stock or tubes that do not meet the requirements of the 
specification shall be rejected. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7 .1 Tensile Requirements 
7 .1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties given in Table 2. 
7.1.2 Table 3 gives the computed minimum elongation 
values for each 1/.12-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. 
Where the wall thickness lies between two values given in 
Table 3, the minimum elongation value shall be determined by 
the following equation:

E = elongation in 2 in. [50 mm] %, and 
t = actual thickness of specimen, in.[mm].

7.2 Hardness Requirements-The tubes shall have a hard­
ness not exceeding the values given in Table 4. 
7.3 Mechanical Tests Required 
7.3.1 Tension Test-One tension test shall be made on a 
specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall 
be made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes (See 8.2). 
7.3.2 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used 
for the flange test, from each lot (See 8.1). 
7.3.3 Flange Test-One flange test shall be made on speci­
mens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used for 
the flattening test, from each lot (See 8.1). 
7.3.4 Reverse Flattening Test-One reverse flattening test 
shall be made on a specimen from each 1500 ft [450 m] of 
finished tubing. 
7.3.5 Hardness Test-Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot (See 
8.2). 
7.3.6 Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Tests-Bach 
tube shall be subjected to either the hydrostatic or the nonde­
structive electric test. The purchaser may specify which is to be 
used. 
8. Sampling 
8.1 For flattening and flange requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting of the same specified outside 
diameter and specified wall thickness that are produced from 
the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a 
batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the 
same size and from the same heat that are heat treated in the 
same furnace charge. When the final heat treatment is in a
