The contour of the reinforcement shall be smooth, \nand the deposited metal shall be fused smoothly and uniformly \ninto the plate surface. \n5.2.4 When radiographic examination in accordance with \n9.1 is to be used, the weld reinforcement shall be governed by \nthe more restrictive provisions of UW-51 of Section VITI of the \nASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code instead of 5.2.3 of this \nspecification. \n5.3 Heat Treatment-All classes other than 10, 11, 12, and \n13 shall be heat treated in a furnace controlled to \u00b1 25 \u00b0F [15 \n0 C] and equipped with a recording pyrometer so that. heating \nrecords are available. Heat treating after forming and welding \nshall be to one of the following: \n5.3.1 Classes 20, 21, 22, and 23 pipe shall be uniformly \nheated within the post-weld heat-treatment temperature range \nindicated in Table 2 for a minimum of 1 h/in. [0.4 hr/cm] of \nthickness or for 1 h, whichever is greater. \n5.3.2 Classes 30, 31, 32, and 33 pipe shall be uniformly \nheated to a temperature in the austenitizing range and not \nexceeding the maximum normalizing temperature indicated in \nTable 2 and subsequently cooled in air at room temperature. \n5.3.3 Classes 40, 41, 42, and 43 pipe shall be normalized in \naccordance with 5.3.2. After normalizing, the pipe shall be \nreheated to the tempering temperature indicated in Table 2 as a \nminimum and held at temperature for a minimum of \u00bd hhn. \n[0.2 hr/cm] of thickness or for \u00bd h, whichever is greater, and \nair cooled. \n5.3.4 Classes 50, 51, 52, and 53 pipe shall be uniformly \nheated to a temperature in the austenitizing range, and not \nexceeding the maximum quenching temperature indicated in \nTable 2 and subsequently quenched in water or oil. After \nquenching, the pipe shall be reheated to the tempering tem\u00ad\nperature indicated in Table 2 as a minimum and held at that \ntemperature for a minimum of\u00bd h/in. [0.2 hr/cm] of thickness \nor for \u00bd h, whichever is greater, and air cooled. \n5.4 Grade 91 shall be produced only to classes 4X and 5X. \nIn addition, post-weld heat treatment is required after weld \nrepair. \n6. General Requirements \n6.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to \nthe applicable requirements of the current edition of Specifi\u00ad\ncation A530/A530M, unless otherwise provided herein. \n7. Chemical Requirements \n7.1 Product Analysis of Plate-The pipe manufacturer shall \nmake an analysis of each mill heat of plate material. The \nproduct analysis so determined shall meet the requirements of \nthe plate specification to which the material was ordered. \n7.2 Product Analysis of Weld-The pipe manufacturer shall \nmake an analysis of finished deposited weld metal from each \n200 ft [60 m] or fraction thereof. Analysis shall conform to the \nwelding procedure for deposited weld metal. \n7.3 Analysis may be taken from the mechanical test speci\u00ad\nmens. The results of the analyses shall be reported to the \npurchaser. \n7.4 If the analysis of one of these tests specified in 7 .1 or 7 .2 \ndoes not conform to the requirements specified, analyses shall \nbe made on additional pipes of double the original number \nfrom the same lot, each of which shall conform to the \nrequirements specified. Nonconforming pipe shall be rejected. \n8. Mechanical Requirements \n8.1 Tension Test: \n8.1.1 Requirements-Transverse tensile properties of the \nwelded joint shall meet the minimum requirements for ultimate \ntensile strength of the specified plate material. \n8.1.2 Number of Tests-One test specimen shall be made to \nrepresent each lot of finished pipe. \nTABLE 2 Heat Treatment ParametersA \nASTM Post-Weld Heat-Treat \nPipe Grade Specification Temperature Range (Stress \nRelieving), \u00b0F (\u00b0C) \nCM-65 A204/A204M 1100 to 1200 [590 to 650] \nCM-70 A204/A204M 1100 to 1200 [590 to 650] \nCM-75 A204/A204M 1100 to 1200 [590 to 650] \nCMSH-70 A537/A537M 1100 to 1200 [590 to 650] \nCMS-75 A299/A299M 1100 to 1200 [590 to 650] \nCMSH-80 A537/A537M 1100 to 1200 [590 to 650] \n%CR A387/A387M 1100 to 1300 [590 to 705] \n1CR A387/A387M 11 00 to 1350 [590 to 730] \n1\u00bcCR A387/A387M 1100 to 1375 [590 to 745] \n2\u00bcCR A387/A387M 1200 to 1400 [650 to 760] \n3CR A387/A387M 1200 to 1400 [650 to 760] \n5CR A387/A387M 1200 to 1400 [650 to 760] \n9CR A387/A387M 1325 to 1375 [715 to 745] \n91 A387/A387M 1350 to 1420 [730 to 770] \nA\\Nhere ellipses ( ... ) appear in the table, there is no requirement. \n8 Requires quenching and tempering. \nNormalizing \nTemperature, \nmax unless \notherwise noted, \nOF (OC) \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \nB \n1850 [1010] \n1850 [1010] \n1850 [1010] \n1850 [1010] \n1850 [1010] \n1850 [1010] \nC \n1900 to 2000 \n[1040 to 1095] \nQuenching \nTemperature, \nmax unless \notherwise noted, \nOF (OC) \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1650 [900] \n1900 min \n[1040 min] \nTempering Temperature, \nmin, \u00b0F (\u00b0C) \n1100 to 1250 [590 to 675] \n1150 to 1375 [620 to 745] \n1150 to 1375 [620 to 745] \n1150 to 1375 [620 to 745] \n1250 to 1400 [675 to 760] \n1250 to 1400 [675 to 760] \n1300 to 1400 [705 to 760] \n1325 to 1375 [715 to 745] \n1350 to 1440 [730 to 780] \n0 9CR steel is an air-hardenable steel, at times retaining austenite down to near atmospheric temperature.
