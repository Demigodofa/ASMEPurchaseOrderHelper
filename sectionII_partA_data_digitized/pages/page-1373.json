These requirements shall not be \nconsidered, unless specified in the order, in which event the necessary tests shall be made by the \nmanufacturer prior to the bending or shipment of the tubing. \nSl. Nondestructive Eddy-Current Test \nS 1.1 Each tube in the finished condition, except for bending \nif that is required, shall be tested by passing it through an \nelectric nondestrnctive tester capable of detecting defects on \nthe entire cross section of the tube. Suitable instrumentation \nshall be used to clearly distinguish the artificial defects. The \noutside and inside surfaces of the tubes shall be free of loose \nscale, metallic particles, or other material that would tend to \nrestrict signals or create electrical noise. The tubing shall be \ninspected by feeding it longitudinally through an inspection \ncoil or coils with a diameter suitable for the diameter of tubing \nto be inspected. The instrument calibration shall be accom\u00ad\nplished with a reference standard prepared from the approp1iate \nlength of selected tubing of the same size, grade, and physical \ncondition as the material to be inspected. The standard shall be \nfed through the coil at the same speed that the inspection of the \ntubing is performed. \nSl.2 The factors listed in S1.3 shall be selected or adjusted, \nor both, in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's \ninstrnctions, for the particular instrument involved as required \nto achieve optimum instrument distinction between the refer\u00ad\nence defects and plain portions of the tube. \nS 1.3 The following as well as other factors involved shall \nnot be used in such a manner that they detract from the overall \nability of the instrument to detect defects: test frequency, \ndirect-cmTent saturation level, filter networks, phase-analysis \ncircuits, coil diameter, and instrument gain. \nSl.4 The reference standard shall consist of a defect-free \nsample of the same size, alloy, and condition (temper) as that \nbeing tested, and shall contain longitudinal and circumferential \nnotches on the outside diameter establishing the rejection level \nof the tubing to be tested. Inside diameter notches, both \nlongitudinal and transverse, shall also be a part of the reference \nstandard. These inside notches may be larger than the outside \nnotches, and are intended for use only to assure instrument \nphase settings capable of yielding optimum inside surface \nsensitivity. \nS 1.4.1 All notches shall be produced by EDM methods. The \noutside diameter notches shall be of the dimensions shown in \nTable S 1.1. See also Fig. S LI. \nS 1.5 All tubing shall meet this specification. The instrument \ncalibration shall be verified at the start of testing, after any shut \ndown of the test equipment, after any test equipment \nadjustment, or at least every V2 h of continuous production \ntesting, or both. Tubes generating a signal above the outside\u00ad\ndiameter calibration standard sensitivity level shall be rejected. \nS 1.6 Tubes may be reconditioned and retested provided \nreconditioning does not adversely effect the minimum wall \nthickness or other properties of the tube specification require-\nOD, in. \n[mm] \n% to 1 \n[15.9 to \n25.4] \nincl \nTABLE S1 .1 Notch DepthA \nLength, Wall, in. \n[mm] \nDepth, max \nin.

S1 .1 Eddy-Current Test Standard \nments. Upon agreement between purchaser and manufacturer, \nthe referee method, employing ultrasonic testing, may be \nemployed for retesting tubes rejected by the eddy-current test. \nThe calibration standard for this test shall be identical to that \nrequired for the eddy-current test. \nS2. Nondestructive Eddy-Current Testing (Select Com\u00ad\nmercial Grade) \nS2. l The manufacturer shall test the tubing using the \nprocedure outlined in Supplementary Requirement SI, except \nfor the notch standards, which shall be as indicated in Table \nS2.1. \nS3. Report \nS3.1 A report shall be furnished by the manufacturer to \ninclude a record of all tests performed to qualify material to \nthis specification. This record shall include numbers of tests \nperformed and qualitative or quantitative results as are appli\u00ad\ncable. \n1311 ",
