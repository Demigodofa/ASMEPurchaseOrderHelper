[50 mm] \nNoTE 1-For clarity, only the Charpy V-notch specimen is shown in Figs. 1-4. The tension test specimen shall be located such that its orientation and \nthe mid-length location meet the same requirements as that for the Charpy V-notch test specimen shown in Figure 1. \nFIG. 1 Separately Forged Test Bar for Forgings with T ,,; 2 in. [50 mm] \n(1) Except as stated in 7.1.3.2 (2) and 7.1.3.2 (3), the \ncentral axis of the test specimen shall be taken at least \u00bc T \nfrom the nearest heat-treated surface and its mid-length shall be \nat least 2 in. [50 mm] from all other heat treated surfaces, \nexclusive of the T dimension surfaces. See Fig. 2 for test \nspecimen location in separately forged test blanks. \n(2) For quenched-and-tempered or for quenched-and\u00ad\nprecipitation-heat-treated forgings, the central axis of the test \nspecimen shall be taken at least \u00bc T from the nearest heat\u00ad\ntreated surface, and the mid- length of the test specimen shall be \nat least T from all other heat treated surfaces, exclusive of the \nT dimension surfaces. See Fig. 3 for test specimen location in \nseparately forged test blanks. \n(3) For quenched-and-tempered or for quenched-and\u00ad\nprecipitation-heat-treated forgings that have a W/T ratio < 2, \nthe central axis of the test specimen shall be taken at least \u00bc T \nfrom the nearest heat-treated surface, and at mid-width of the \nforging, where Wis the width of the forging. The test specimen \nmid-length shall be at least T from the ends of the forging or \ntest blank. See Fig. 4 for test specimen location in separately \nforged test blank. \n7.1.3.3 Metal Buffers-The required distances from heat \ntreated surfaces for the test locations described in 7.1.3.1 and \n7.1.3.2 may be obtained with metal buffers instead of integral \nexpansions. Buffer material may be carbon or low alloy steel, \nand shall be joined to the forging with a partial penetration \nweld that seals the buffered surface. Specimens shall be located \nat\u00bd in. [13 mm] minimum from the buffered surface of the \nforging. Buffers shall be removed after heat treatment and the \nwelded areas subjected to magnetic particle test to assure \nfreedom from cracks unless the welded areas are completely \nremoved by subsequent machining. \n7.1.3.4 The test specimen shall have its longitudinal axis \nlocated parallel to the direction of major working of the forging \nor test blank. \n7.1.3.5 With prior purchaser approval, tests may be taken at \na depth (t) corresponding to the distance from the area of \nsignificant loading to the nearest heat treated surface and at \nleast twice this distance (2t) from any second surface. \nHowever, the test depth shall not be nearer to one treated \nsurface than\u00be in. [19 mm] and to the second treated surface \nthan 1 \u00bd in. [38 mm]. This method of test location would \nnormally apply to contour-forged parts, or parts with thick \ncross-sectional areas where \u00bc T x T testing (7.1.3.2) is not \npractical. Sketches showing the exact test locations shall be \napproved by the purchaser when this method is used. \n7 .1.4 Test Method-Testing shall be performed as specified \nin Specification A961/A961M. The test specimen shall be as \nlarge as is practicable and shall be machined to the form and \ndimensions in Specification A961/A961M. When seamless \ntubular materials are used, testing shall be performed on \nlongitudinal specimens as specified in Specification A961/ \nA961M. \n531 \n1.2 Impact Test: \n7 .2.1 Requirements-The material shall conform to the \nrequirements for impact properties in Table 3 when tested at \nthe applicable standard temperature in Table 4 within the limits \nof 7.2.4.2 and 7.2.4.3. When subsize specimens are used, the \nimpact energy values obtained shall conform to Table 5 at \nenergy values proportional to standard size. Exceptions to this \nrequirement are permissible when Supplementary Requirement \nS 1 is specified by the purchaser. Impact tests may be made at \ntemperatures different from those in Table 4, provided that the ",
