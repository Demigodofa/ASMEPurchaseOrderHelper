Wt) \nFF = ( Combined Heat Weight) X lOO % \nStep # 2-Calculate the weighted average for each element. \nExamples for several elements shown below: \nWeighted avg= sum of ( % element in each furnace heat X FF) \n\u2022 Weighted avg of Carbon (weighted avg): \nFurnace A-0.20 % x 20 % = 0.04 % \nFurnace B-0.25 % x 40 % = 0.10 % \nFurnace C-0.25 % x 40 % = 0.1 0 % \nAdd to get weighted avg of 0.24 % \nIndividual Heat Chemistry, % \ns \n0.020 \n0.015 \n0.Q18 \nSi Ni \n0.34 0.92 \n0.38 0.98 \n0.38 0.94 \nCr \n0.32 \n0.32 \n0.34 \nMo \n0.12 \n0.12 \n0.13 \nV \n0.03 \n0.02 \n0.02 \n\u2022 Weighted avg of manganese: \nFurnace A-0.50 % x 20 % = 0.10 % \nFurnace B-0.50 % x 40 % = 0.20 % \nFurnace C-0.50 % x 40 % = 0.20 % \nAdd to get weighted avg of 0.50 % \n\u2022 Weighted avg of phosphorus: \nFurnace A-0.010 % x 20 % = 0.002 % \nFurnace B-0.013 % x 40 % = 0.0052 % \nFurnace C-0.015 % x 40 % = 0.006 % \nAdd to get weighted avg of 0.013 %A \nA (Round to significant figures in accordance with Practice E380.) \n\u2022 The same procedure Is used for all of the other elements. \nA3. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW MATERIALS \nA3.1 New materials may be proposed for inclusion in \nspecifications referencing this specification of general require\u00ad\nments subject to the following conditions: \nA3.l.1 Application for the addition of a new grade to a \nspecification shall be made to the chair of the subcommittee \nthat has jurisdiction over that specification. \nA3 .1.2 The application shall be accompanied by a statement \nfrom at least one user indicating that there is a need for the new \ngrade to be included in the applicable specification. \nA3.l.3 The application shall be accompanied by test data as \nrequired by the applicable specification. Test data from a \nminimum of three test lots, as defined by the specification, each \nfrom a different heat, shall be furnished. \nA3.l.4 The application shall provide recommendations for \nall requirements appearing in the applicable specification. \nA3.l.5 The application shall state whether or not the new \ngrade is covered by patent. \nA4. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF MATERIALS FROM OTHER A0l OR B02.07 SPECIFICATIONS \nA4.l Wrought materials that are already covered by another \nAOl or B02.07 specification may be proposed for inclusion in \nspecifications referencing this specification of general require\u00ad\nments subject to the following conditions: \nA4.1.1 Application for the addition of a grade that is already \ncovered in another AOl or B02.07 specification shall be made \nto the chair of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the \nspecification to which the addition is being proposed. \nA4.1.2 The chemical requirements, the specified mechani\u00ad\ncal properties, and the heat treatment requirements of the grade \nbeing added shall be the same as those for the grade in the AOl \nor B02.07 specification in which the grade is presently covered. \nA4.1.3 The application shall provide recommendations for \nall requirements appearing in the applicable specification. \nA4. l.4 The application shall state whether or not the grade \nis covered by patent. \u2022 \n1284 ",
