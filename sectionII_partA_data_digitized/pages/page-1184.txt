SA-667 /SA-667M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Centrifugally Cast Dual Metal (Gray and White Cast Iron) 
Cylinders 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers centrifugally cast cylinders 
with an outer layer of white cast iron and the remainder of the 
material of gray cast iron. These castings are suitable for 
pressure containing parts the design strength of which is based 
on the gray iron portion of the cylinder. These castings are 
suitable for service at temperatures up to 450°F [230°C]. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.3 The following safety hazards caveat pertains only to the 
test method portion, Section 8, of this specification: This 
standard does not purport to address all of the sqfety concerns, 
if' any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user 
of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limita­
tions prior to use. 
2. Referenced Documents 
2.1 ASTM Standards: 
A278/A278M Specification for Gray Iron Castings for 
Pressure-Containing Parts for Temperatures Up to 650°F 
(350°C) 
3. Materials and Manufacture 
3.1 The melting procedures shall be optional with the 
foundry. 
3.2 The white iron pmtion of the cylinder shall be made to 
a minimum hardness of 55 Scleroscope "C". The gray iron 
portion of the cylinder shall conform to Specification A278/ 
A278M, Class 20 or Class 150. 
3.3 The casting process shall be controlled to produce a 
metallurgical bond between the two metal layers. 
4. :Finish 
4.1 All surfaces shall be machined prior to the cylinders 
being placed into service. 
5. Physical Requirements 
5.1 Tensile Requirements-Tension test specimens removed 
from the casting shall have a tensile strength not less than 80 % 
of that specified in 3.2. 
5.2 Thickness of White Cast Iron: 
5.2. l The thickness of the white cast iron shall be not less 
than 5 % nor more than 30 % of the total finished wall 
thickness. 
5.2.2 The thickness of the white cast iron shall be deter­
mined by ultrasonic testing. 
6. Number of Tests 
6.1 The number of tension tests shall be in conformance 
with Specification A278/A278M. 
7. Specimen Preparation 
7.1 Separately cast test bars may be used to represent the 
gray iron portion of the castings. The test bars shall be cast in 
core sand and have a nominal dimneter of 2 in. [50 mm]. 
Tension test specimens shall be machined from test bars to the 
dimensions given for Specimen C in Specification A278/ 
A278M. 
7 .2 At the option of the manufacturer he may substitute test 
bars taken from the gray iron portion of the casting. The test 
bars shall be taken midway between the inside diameter of the 
casting and the interface between the two layers. Tension test 
specimens machined from these test bars shall conform to the 
dimensions shown for Specimen C in Specification A278/ 
A278M.
