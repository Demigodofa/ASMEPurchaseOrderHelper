A To meet the tensile requirements, the Brinell hardness shall be over 200 HBW (93 HRS). 
8 Class 1 is solution treated. Class 1 A is solution treated in the finished condition for corrosion resistance; heat treatment is critical due to physical property requirement. 
Class 2 is solution treated and strain hardened. Austenitic steels in the strain-hardened condition may not show uniform properties throughout the section particularly in 
sizes over M20 mm in diameter. 
c For sizes M20 mm in diameter and smaller, a maximum hardness of 241 HBW (100 HRS) is permitted. 
° For diameters M38 and over, center (core) properties may be lower than indicated by test reports which are based on values determined at½ radius.
