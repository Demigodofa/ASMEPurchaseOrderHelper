10.4.1 A notched-bar impact test, consisting of breaking 
three specimens shall be made. Each test shall represent only 
such fittings from a heat that do not vary from the thickness of 
the material from which the test specimens are taken by more 
than ¼ in. [6 mm]. 
10.4.2 When heat treatment is performed in furnaces not 
equipped with calibrated recording pyrometers, one impact test 
shall be made for each heat in each heat-treatment load. Test 
specimens shall be included with each furnace charge. If this 
heat treatment is conducted in continuous-type furnaces not 
equipped with calibrated recording pyrometers, then one test 
per heat shall be conducted for each 5000 lb or 2550 kg (or 
less) of product. 
10.4.3 When heat treatment is performed in furnaces con­
trolled within a 50 °F [28 °C] range and equipped with 
calibrated recording pyrometers so that records of heat treat­
ment are available, then one impact test from each heat is 
required, provided that all other heat treatments are conducted 
at the same temperatures and within the same 50 °F [28 °C] 
range as the furnace charge that contained the test specimens. 
10.4.4 On fittings of welded construction, additional impact 
tests of the same number as required in 10.4.1 or 10.4.2 shall 
be made to test the weld metal. 
10.4.5 Specimens showing defects while being machined or 
prior to testing shall be discarded, and replacements shall be 
considered as original specimens. 
10.5 Retreatment: 
10.5.1 If the results of impact tests conducted in accordance 
with 10.4.2 and 10.4.3 fail to conform to the test requirements 
specified in 10.1, that group of fittings shall be retreated and 
submitted for test. No group of fittings shall be retreated more 
than twice. 
11. Hydrostatic Tests 
11.1 Hydrostatic testing of fittings is not required by this 
specification. 
11.2 All fittings shall be capable of withstanding without 
failure, leakage, or impairment of their serviceability, a hydro­
static test pressure equal to that prescribed for the specified 
matching pipe of equivalent material. 
12. Dimensions 
12.1 Butt-welding fittings and butt-welding short-radius 
elbows and returns purchased in accordance with this specifi­
cation shall confonn to the dimensions and tolerances given in 
the latest revision of ASME Bl6.9 or MSS SP-95. Steel 
socket-welding and threaded fittings purchased in accordance 
with this specification shall conform to the sizes, shapes, 
dimensions, and tolerances specified in the latest revision of 
ASME B16.ll, MSS SP-79, or MSS SP-83. Swage(d) Nipples, 
Bull Plugs, and Integrally Reinforced Forged Branch Outlet 
Fittings purchased in accordance with this specification shall 
conform to the sizes, shapes, dimensions, and tolerances 
specified in the latest revision of MSS SP-95 or MSS SP-97. 
12.2 Fittings of size or shape differing from these standards, 
but meeting all other requirements of the specification, shall be 
furnished in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S58 
of Specification A960/ A960M only by agreement with the 
purchaser. 
13. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion 
Protection 
13.1 The requirements of Specification A960/ A960M apply. 
14. Repair by Welding 
14.1 The requirements of Specification A960/A960M apply 
except as follows: 
14.l.1 Repair welding, by the manufacturer, is permissible 
for parts made to dimensional standards such as those of 
ASME or equivalent standards. 
14.1.2 Prior approval of the purchaser shall be required to 
weld repair special parts made to the purchaser's dimensional 
requirements. 
14.1.3 Welding shall be accomplished with a weld proce­
dure designed to produce low hydrogen in the weldment. Short 
circuit gas metal arc welding is permissible only with the 
approval of the purchaser. 
704 
14.1.4 The weld repair shall be permanently identified with 
the welder's stamp or symbol in accordance with Section IX of 
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
14.1.5 After weld repair, material shall be heat treated in 
accordance with 7.1. 
14.1.6 Tension and impact testing of representative depos­
ited weld metal for each heat shall meet the requirements of 9 .2 
and 10.1. 
15. Radiographic Examination 
15.1 All fusion-welded butt joints shall be radiographically 
examined throughout the entire length in accordance with 
Paragraph UW-51 of Section VIII, Division 1, of the ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Instead of radiographic 
examination, welds made by the manufacturer may be ultra­
sonically examined in accordance with Appendix 12 of Section 
VIII, Division 1, of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code. In general, radiography or ultrasonic examination shall 
be performed after all forming operations have been com­
pleted. Fittings made from fusion-welded pipe need not be 
radiographed if the pipe has been radiographed, provided the 
fitting forming process does not materially affect the weld. 
16. Inspection 
16.l All tests and inspections shall be made at the place of 
manufacture, unless otherwise agreed to. 
16.2 Other tests, when required by agreement shall be made 
from materials of the lots covered in the order.
