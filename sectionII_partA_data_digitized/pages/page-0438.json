Scope \n1. 1 This specification covers plate of a carbon steel or \nlow-alloy steel base to which is integrally and continuously \nbonded on one or both sides a layer of nickel or nickel-base \nalloy. The material is generally intended for pressure vessel use \nbut may be used in other structural applications where corro\u00ad\nsion resistance of the alloy is of prime importance. \n1.2 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded \nas standard. The values given in parentheses are mathematical \nconversions to SI units that are provided for information only \nand are not considered standard. \n2.
