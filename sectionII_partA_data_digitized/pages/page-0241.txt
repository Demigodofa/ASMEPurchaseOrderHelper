ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-135/SA-135M (ASTM A135/A135M) 
The examination may not detect circumferentially oriented 
imperfections of short, deep imperfections. 
11.3.2 The eddy-current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
imperfections, especially of the short, abrupt type. 
11.3.3 The hydrostatic test referred to in Section 10 is a test 
method provided for in many product specifications. This test 
has the capability of finding imperfections of a size permitting 
the test fluid to leak through the tube wall and may be either 
visually seen or detected by a loss of pressure. This test may 
not detect very tight, through-the-wall imperfections or imper­
fections that extend an appreciable distance into the wall 
without complete penetration. 
11.3 .4 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of imperfections that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
11.4 In order to accommodate the various types of nonde­
structive electric testing equipment and techniques in use, the 
calibration pipe shall contain, at the option of the producer, any 
one or more of the following discontinuities to establish a 
minimum sensitivity level for rejection: 
11.4.1 Drilled Hole-A hole not larger than 0.031-in. [0.8-
mm] diameter shall be drilled radially and completely through 
pipe wall, preferably in the weld area, care being taken to avoid 
distortion of the pipe while drilling. 
11.4.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-A notch shall be filed 
or milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the 
longitudinal axis of the pipe preferably in the weld area. Said 
notch shall have a depth not exceeding 12.5 % of the nominal 
wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in., [0.10 mm], whichever 
is greater. 
11.4.3 Longituclinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
pipe axis on the outside surface of the pipe preferably in the 
weld area, to have a depth not exceeding 12.5 % of the nominal 
wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.10 mm], whichever is 
greater. 
11.5 Pipe producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
calibration imperfection shall be rejected. 
12. Dimensions, Weight (Mass), and Permissible 
Variations 
12.1 Weight (Mass)-The weight (mass) of any length of 
pipe other than Schedule 10 shall not vary more than 3.5 % 
under or 10 % over that specified, but the carload weight 
(mass) shall be not more than 1.75 % under the nominal weight 
(mass). The weight (mass) of pipe furnished to Schedule 10 
shall not vary more than ± 10 % from that calculated using the 
weight (mass) per unit length prescribed in Appendix Table 
Xl.1. The weight (mass) of the pipe shall be calculated from 
the relevant equation in ASME B36.10M. 
NoTE 4-A system of standard pipe sizes has been approved by the 
American National Standards Institute as American National Standard for 
Welded and Seamless Wrought Steel Pipe (ASME B36.lOM). 
12.2 Diameter-The outside diameter shall not vary more 
than ± 1 % from the nominal size specified. 
12.3 Minimum Wall Thickness-The minimum wall thick­
ness at any point shall be not more than 12.5 % under the 
specified wall thickness. 
NoTE 5-The minimum wall thickness on inspection is shown in Table 
Xl.2 of the Appendix. 
12.4 Lengths: 
12.4.1 Except as allowed in 12.4.2, pipe shall be furnished 
in lengths averaging 38 ft [11.6 m] or over, with a minimum 
length of 20 ft [6.1 m], but no more than 5 % may be under 32 
ft [9.8 m]. Jointers made by welding are permissible. When 
threaded pipe is ordered, jointers shall be made by threaded 
connections and shall not exceed 5 % of the order. 
12.4.2 Unless otherwise specified, Schedule 10 pipe shall be 
between 16 and 22 ft [4.9 and 6.7 m] for a minimum of 90 % 
of the footage furnished, with any balance being shorter 
lengths at least 8 ft [2.4 m] long. 
13. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
13.1 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight and free 
of defects. Surface imperfections in excess of 12.5 % of the 
nominal wall thickness shall be considered defects. 
13.2 End Finish: 
13.2.1 Schedule JO Pipe-Pipe furnished to Schedule 10 
shall be plain end only. All inside and outside cutting burrs 
shall be removed. This generally involves breaking the comers. 
13.2.2 Ends, Plain End Pipe-Unless otherwise specified, 
plain end pipe for use with the Dresser or Dayton type coupling 
shall be reamed both outside and inside sufficiently to remove 
all burrs. Plain end pipe for welding shall be beveled on the 
outside to an angle of 30° with a tolerance of+ 5° and - 0° and 
with a width of flat at the end of the pipe of 1/16 ± ½2 in. [1.6 
± 0.8 mm]. When material is ordered beveled to any other than 
a 30° angle, it should be understood that the angle is to be 
measured from a line drawn perpendicular to the axis of the 
pipe. This means that a greater amount of material is removed 
with a 60° angle than with a 30° angle. Pipe shall be 
sufficiently free from indentations, projections, or roll marks 
for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] from the end of the pipe to 
make a tight joint with the rubber gasket type of coupling. All 
plain end pipe intended for Dresser or Dayton type joints or for 
welding, sizes NPS 10 [DN 250] and smaller in outside 
diameter specified, shall be not more than 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] 
smaller than the outside diameter specified for a distance of 8 
in. [200 mm] from the ends of the pipe and shall permit the 
passing for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] of a ring gauge that has 
a bore 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] larger than the outside diameter 
specified of the pipe. Sizes larger than NPS 10 [DN 250] shall 
be not more than 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] smaller than the nominal 
outside diameter for a distance of 8 in. [200 mm] from the end 
of the pipe and shall permit the passing for a distance of 8 in. 
[200 mm] of a ring gauge which has a bore 3/32 in. [2.4 mm] 
larger than the nominal outside diameter of the pipe.

13.2.3 Ends, Threaded Pipe-Each end of threaded pipe 
shall be reamed to remove all burrs. All threads shall be in 
accordance with the American National Standard Pipe Threads
