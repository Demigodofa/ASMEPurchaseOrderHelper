Scope \n1.1 This specification covers a variety of carbon, alloy, and \nmartensitic stainless steel nuts in the size range \u00bc through 4 in. \nand metric M12 through MlO0 nominal. It also covers auste\u00ad\nnitic stainless steel nuts in the size range \u00bc in. and Ml2 \nnominal and above. These nuts are intended for high-pressure \nor high-temperature service, or both. Grade substitutions with\u00ad\nout the purchaser's permission are not allowed. \n1.2 Bars from which the nuts are made shall be hot-wrought. \nThe material may be further processed by centerless grinding \nor by cold drawing. Austenitic stainless steel may be solution \nannealed or annealed and strain-hardened. When annealed and \nstrain hardened austenitic stainless steel is ordered in accor\u00ad\ndance with Supplementary Requirement S 1, the purchaser \nshould take special care to ensure that 8.2.2, Supplementary \nRequirement Sl, and Appendix Xl are thoroughly understood. \n1.3 Supplementary requirements of an optional nature are \nprovided. These shall apply only when specified in the inquiry, \ncontract, and order. \n1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units \nand in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the \napplicable \"M\" specification designation (SI units), the mate\u00ad\nrial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. \n1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. Within the text, the SI units are shown in \nbrackets. \n248 \n1.6 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
