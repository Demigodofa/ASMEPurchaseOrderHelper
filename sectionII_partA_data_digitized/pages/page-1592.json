Scope \n1.1 This specification covers Chromium-Molybdenum\u00ad\nTungsten alloy steel plates intended primarily for welded \nboilers and pressure vessels designed for elevated temperature \nservice. \n1.2 Plates are available under this specification in grades \nhaving different alloy contents as follows: \nNominal Nominal Nominal \nChromium Molybdenum Tungsten \nGrade Content,% Content,% Content,% \n23 2.25 0.20 1.60 \n911 9.00 1.00 1.00 \n92 9.00 0.45 1.75 \n122 12.00 0.40 2.00 \n1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the \ncapacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical \nproperty requirements. \n1.4 The specification is expressed in both inch-pound units \nand in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the \napplicable \"M\" specification designation (SI units), the mate\u00ad\nrial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. \n1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n1.6 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA20/A20M Specification for General Requirements for Steel \nPlates for Pressure Vessels \nA435/A435M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic \nExamination of Steel Plates \nA577/A577M Specification for Ultrasonic Angle-Beam Ex\u00ad\namination of Steel Plates \nA578/A578M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic \nExamination of Rolled Steel Plates for Special Applica\u00ad\ntions \n3. General Requirements \n3 .1 Material supplied to this material specification shall \nconform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out\u00ad\nline the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit\u00ad\nted variations in dimensions and mass, quality and repair of \ndefects, marking, loading, and ordering information. \n3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this \nspecification, certain supplementary requirements are available \nwhen additional control, testing, or examination is required to \nmeet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the \nlisted supplementary requirements in this specification and to \nthe detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. \n3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require\u00ad\nments of this specification shall prevail. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed. \n5. Heat Treatment \n5.1 Except as allowed by 5.2 and 5.3, all plates shall be \nnormalized at 1900 to 1975\u00b0F [1040 to 1080\u00b0C]. Plates for \nGrades 23, 92, and 122 shall be tempered at 1350 to 1470\u00b0F \n[730 to 800\u00b0C]. Grade 911 plates shall be tempered at 1365 to \n1435\u00b0F [740 to 780\u00b0C]. \n1538 ",
