A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope \n1.1 This specification 2 covers two kinds of rolls used in \nmachinery for producing corrugated paperboard. Rolls are \nfabricated of forged bodies and trunnions. The trunnions may \nbe bolted or shrink assembled on one or both ends of the body. \nA seal weld may be made at the body/trunnion interface. Roll \nshells are made of carbon/manganese, or low alloy steel as \nhereinafter described, and are heat treated prior to assembly. \nPressure rolls may be ordered surface hardened as Condition \nH, or without surface hardening as Condition S. Provision is \nmade in Supplementary Requirements S 1 and S3 for the \noptional surface hardening of corrugating rolls. \n1.2 Corrugating and pressure rolls made to this specification \nshall not exceed 30 in. [760 mm] in inside diameter. The wall \nthickness of the roll body shall not be less than 1/12 of the inside \ndiameter or 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is greater, but shall not \nexceed 4 in. [100 mm]. The wall thickness of the corrugating \nroll is measured at the bottom of the corrugations in the \nlocation of the trunnion fit. The maximum design temperature \n(MDT) of the roll is 600 \u00b0F [315 \u00b0C] and the maximum \nallowable working pressure (MAWP) is 250 psi [1.7 MPa]. The \nminimum design temperature shall be 40 \u00b0F [4 \u00b0C] for roll wall \nthicknesses up to 3 in. [75 mm]. For roll wall thicknesses over \n3 in. [75 mm] to 4 in. [100 mm], the minimum design \ntemperature shall be 120 \u00b0F [50 \u00b0C]. The maximum stresses on \nthe roll bodies from the combined internal and external loading \nare limited to 18 750 psi [129 MPa] for the Class 2 pressure \nroll bodies, and 20 000 psi [138 MPa] for Class lA, lB, or 5 \npressure or corrugating roll bodies in Grades 1 or 2. For the \ntrunnions, the maximum stresses from the combined internal \nand external loading are limited to 15 000 psi [103.4 MPa] for \nClasses 3 or 4, or 20 000 psi [138 MPa] for Classes IA, lB, or \n5 in Grade 2 only. The Grade 1 strength level is not pennissible \nfor trunnions. \n1.3 Referring to Table 1, material to Classes lA, lB, or 5 \nshall be used for the manufacture of corrugating or pressure \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee A0l on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0!.06 on Steel Forgings and Billets. \nCurrent edition approved March I, 2020.

Trunnions shall be made from forgings in Classes lA, \nlB, or 5 in Grade 2 strength level as restricted by Footnote B \nin Table 2 or in forgings in either Class 3 or 4. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to \nensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be \nused independently of the other, and values from the two \nsystems shall not be combined. \n1.5 Unless the order specifies the applicable \"M\" specifica\u00ad\ntion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch\u00ad\npound units. \n1.6 Except as specifically required in this standard, all of the \nprovisions of Specification A788/A788M apply. \n1.7 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
