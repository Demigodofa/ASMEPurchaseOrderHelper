Failure to comply with the require\u00ad\nments of Specification A962/A962M constitutes nonconfor\u00ad\nmance with this specification. In case of conflict between this \nspecification and Specification A962/ A962M, this specification \nshall prevail. \n5. Heat Treatment \n5.1 Grades B4B and B4C shall be heated to a temperature \nrange of 1875 to 1925 \u00b0F [1025 to 1050 \u00b0C] and liquid \nquenched to below 600 \u00b0F [316 \u00b0C]. The material Grades B4B \nand B4C shall then be uniformly reheated for tempering at a \ntempering temperature at least 100 \u00b0F [55 \u00b0C] higher than the \nproposed operating temperature but not less than 1150 \u00b0F [620 \n0 C], then air or furnace cooled to room temperature. The \nmaterial shall be at the tempering temperature for a minimum \nof 2 h. Double tempering may be used to enhance properties. \n5.2 Grade B4D shall be heated to a temperature range of \n1700 to 1750 \u00b0F [925 to 954 \u00b0C] and oil quenched. The \nmaterial shall then be uniformly reheated or tempered at a \ntemperature of 1200 \u00b0F [650 \u00b0C] minimum, followed by air or \nfurnace cooling to room temperature. \n5.3 Stress relieving treatment of the bar material is required \nafter any stretcher, roller, or rotary-straightening or cold\u00ad\nfinishing operations performed after heat treatment for me\u00ad\nchanical properties. Local gagging or press straightening to \nconect camber limitations in excess of\u00bc in. in any 5 ft [6 mm \nin any 1.5 m] shall be followed by a stress relieving heat \ntreatment. The minimum stress relieving temperature shall be \n100 \u00b0F [55 \u00b0C] below the minimum tempering temperature as \nshown in 5.1 for Grades B4B and B4C or in 5.2 for Grade \nB4D. \n6.

Tensile Requirements \n7.1 Bolting material shall conform to the requirements as to \ntensile properties prescribed in Table 2 at room temperature \nafter heat treatment. \n7 .2 The longitudinal axis of the test specimen shall be \nparallel to the direction of rolling. \n8. Impact Requirements \n8.1 Grades B4B, B4C, and B4D shall conform to the \nrequirements as to impact properties prescribed in Table 3 at \nroom temperature after heat treatment. \n9. Hardness Tests \n9.1 Grades B4B, B4C, and B4D shall conform to the \nrequirements as to hardness as prescribed in Table 4 and Table \n5 at room temperature after heat treatment. \n10. Nuts \n10.1 When specified by the purchaser, nuts shall be subject \nto the impact and tension requirements of this specification. \nThe tests shall be made on test specimens taken from the bar or \nplate used in the manufacture of the nuts. \n11. Threads \n11.1 All threads shall be formed after heat treatment. \n12. Nondestructive Inspection \n12.1 Each bar or forged blank of starting material shall be \nsubjected to NDE following final heat treatment. The method \nused shall be either the Eddy Current (EC), the Magnetic \nPmiicle (MPI) (wet or dry), the Liquid Penetrant (LPI), the \nUltrasonic (UT), or the Visual Testing (VT), at the option of the \nproducer. For LPI or MPI, linear indications (those indications \nlonger than 1/16 in. [l.5 mm] with a length greater than three \ntimes their width) are unacceptable. For UT or ET, reject levels \nfor linear indications shall be based on the alarm response from \na surface notch with a maximum depth of 0.012 in. [0.30 mm] \nin a calibration bar. Product being subjected to VT shall be \npickled prior to inspection. VT indications longer than 1/8 in. \n[3.2 mm] are prohibited. \n719 \n13. Certification \n13 .1 Certification is required.
