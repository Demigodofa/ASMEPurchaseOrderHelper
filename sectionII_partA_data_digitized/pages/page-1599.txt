ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-1058 
cross-sectional area, the diameter shall be measured at the 
center of the gauge length to the nearest 0.025 mm. 
7.6 General-Test specimens shall be either substantially 
full size or machined, as prescribed in the product specifica­
tions for the material being tested. 
7.6.1 It is desirable to have the cross-sectional area of the 
specimen smallest at the center of the gauge length to ensure 
fracture within the gauge length. This is provided for by the 
taper in the gauge length permitted for each of the specimens 
described in the following sections. 
7 .6.2 For low ductility materials it is desirable to have fillets 
of large radius at the ends of the gauge length. 
• 8. Plate-Type Specimen 
8.1 The standard plate-type test specimen is shown in Test 
Methods E8/E8M, ISO 6892-1, or JIS Z 2241. This specimen 
is used for testing metallic materials in the form of plate, 
structural and bar-size shapes, and flat material having a 
nominal thickness of 5 mm or over. When product specifica­
tions so permit, other types of specimens may be used. 
9. Sheet-Type Specimen 
9.1 The standard sheet-type test specimen is shown in Test 
Methods E8/E8M, ISO 6892-1, or JIS Z 2241. This specimen 
is used for testing metallic materials in the form of sheet, plate, 
flat wire, strip, band, and hoop ranging in nominal thickness 
from 0.13 to 19 mm. When product specifications so permit, 
other types of specimens may be used, as specified in Test 
Methods E8/E8M. 
10. Round Specimens 
10.1 The standard diameter round test specimen as shown in 
Test Methods E8/E8M, ISO 6892-1, or JIS Z 2241 is frequently 
used for testing metallic materials. 
10.2 Small size specimens proportional to standard speci­
mens may be used when it is necessary to test material from 
which the standard specimens cannot be prepared. When small 
size specimens are used, the gauge length for measurement of 
elongation shall be five times the diameter of the specimen. 
10.3 The type of specimen ends outside of the gauge length 
shall accommodate the shape of the product tested, and shall 
properly fit the holders or grips of the testing machine so that 
axial loads are applied with a minimum of load eccentricity and 
slippage. 
11. Gauge Marks 
11.1 Test specimens shall be marked in accordance with the 
requirements of the relevant standards. 
12. Determination of Tensile Properties 
12.1 The determination and description of the tensile prop­
erties shall be in accordance with the requirements of the 
relevant standards. 
12.2 Elongation values may be converted from (i) 4d gauge 
length to a 5d gauge length, or (ii) 5d gage length to a 4d gage 
length by use of the multiplication factors shown in Table 2. If 
this conversion is used, the supplier must show the calculation 
on the certification.

12.2.1 Example I-Conversion of Carbon and low alloy 
steel elongation derived from 4d gauge length to a 5d gauge 
length elongation value: 
23 % X 0.916 = 21 % 
12.2.2 Example 2-Conversion of Austenitic steel elonga­
tion derived from 5d gauge length to a 4d gauge length 
elongation value: 
23 % X l.029 = 24 % 
12.3 Reduction of Area-Fit the ends of the fractured 
specimen together and measure the mean diameter or the width 
and thickness at the smallest cross section to the same accuracy 
as the original dimensions. The difference between the area 
thus found and the area of the original cross section expressed 
as a percentage of the original area is the reduction of area. 
BEND TEST 
13. Description 
13.1 The bend test is one method for evaluating ductility, 
but it cannot be considered as a quantitative means of predict­
ing service performance in all bending operations. The severity 
of the bend test is primarily a function of the angle of bend and 
inside diameter to which the specimen is bent, and of the cross 
section of the specimen. These conditions are varied according 
to location and orientation of the test specimen and the 
chemical composition, tensile properties, hardness, type, and 
quality of the steel specified. Test Method E190, Test Methods 
E290, EN ISO 7438, EN 10232 (tube), ISO 7438, or ISO 8491 
(tube) and JIS Z 2248 may be consulted for methods of 
performing the test. 
13.2 Unless otherwise specified, it shall be pennissible to 
age bend test specimens. The time-temperature cycle employed 
must be such that the effects of previous processing will not be 
materially changed. It may be accomplished by aging at room 
temperature 24 to 48 h, or in shorter time at moderately 
elevated temperatures by boiling in water or by heating in oil 
or in an oven. 
13.3 Bend the test specimen at room temperature to an 
inside diameter, as designated by the applicable product 
specifications, to the extent specified. The speed of bending is 
ordinarily not an important factor. 
HARDNESS TEST 
14. General 
14.1 A hardness test is a means of determining resistance to 
penetration and is occasionally employed to obtain a quick 
approximation of tensile strength. Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, 
and Table 6 are for the conversion of hardness measurements 
from one scale to another or to approximate tensile strength.
