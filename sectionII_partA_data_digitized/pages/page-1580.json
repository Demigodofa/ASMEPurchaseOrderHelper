Scope \n1. 1 This specification covers a group of requirements that, \nunless otherwise specified in an individual specification, shall \napply to the ASTM product specifications noted below. \nTitle of Specification ASTM \nDesignationA \nSeamless Carbon-Molybdenum Alloy-Steel Boiler and A209/A209M \nSuperheater Tubes \nSeamless Ferritic and Austenitic Alloy-Steel Boiler, Superheater, A213/A213M \nand Heat-Exchanger Tubes \nWelded Austenitic Steel Boiler, Superheater, Heat-Exchanger, A249/A249M \nand Condenser Tubes \nElectric-Resistance-Welded Ferritic Alloy-Steel Boiler and A250/A250M \nSuperheater Tubes \nSeamless and Welded Ferritic and Martensitic Stainless Steel A268/ A268M \nTubing for General Service \nSeamless and Welded Austenitic Stainless Steel Tubing for A269/A269M \nGeneral Service \nSeamless and Welded Austenitic Stainless Steel Sanitary A270/A27DM \nTubing \nSeamless and Welded Carbon and Alloy-Steel Tubes for A334/A334M \nLow-Temperature Service \nWelded Austenitic Stainless Steel Feedwater Heater Tubes A688/ A688M \nAustenitic Stainless Steel Tubing for Breeder Reactor Core A771/A771M \nComponents \nSeamless and Welded Ferritic/Austenitic Stainless Steel Tubing A789/A789M \nfor General Service \nWelded Ferritic Stainless Steel Feedwater Heater Tubes A803/ A803M \nAustenitic and Ferritic Stainless Steel Duct Tubes for Breeder A826/ A826M \nReactor Core Components \nHigh-Frequency Induction Welded, Unannealed Austenitic Steel A851 \nCondenser Tubes \nA These designations refer to the latest issue of the respective specifications. \n1.2 In the case of conflict between a requirement of a \nproduct specification and a requirement of this general require\u00ad\nments specification, the product specification shall prevail. In \nthe case of conflict between a requirement of the product \nspecification or a requirement of this general requirements \nspecification and a more stringent requirement of the purchase \norder, the purchase order shall prevail. \n1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation (SI) of the product specification is specified in the \norder. \n1.4 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
