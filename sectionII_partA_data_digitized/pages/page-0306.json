Nuts in the size \nrange\u00bc to 1 \u00bdin.inclusive and M12 to M36 inclusive shall be \nproof load tested. Nuts not in this size range and all types of \nGrade 8 nuts are not subject to this test. Nuts manufactured to \ndimensions and configurations other than those covered by \nSpecification A962/A962M, ASME B 1.1, ASME B 1.13M, \nASME B 18.2.2, or ASME B 18.2.4.6M are not subject to the \ncone proof load test.
