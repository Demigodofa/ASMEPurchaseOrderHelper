Tensile Properties \n7 .1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to \ntensile properties prescribed in the individual specification. \n7 .2 The yield strength corresponding to a permanent offset \nof 0.2 % of the gage length or to a total extension of 0.5 % of \nthe gage length under load shall be determined. \n7.3 If the percentage of elongation of any test specimen is \nless than that specified and any part of the fracture is more than \n\u00be in. [19.0 mm] from the center of the gage length, as \nindicated by scribe marks on the specimen before testing, a \nretest shall be allowed. \n8. Standard Weights \n8.1 The calculated weight per unit length, based upon a \nspecified minimum wall thickness, shall be determined by the \nfollowing equation: \nW= C(D - t)t \nwhere: \nC = 10.69 [0.0246615], \nW == weight, lb/ft [kg/m], \nD = specified outside diameter, in. [mm], and \nt = specified minimum wall thickness, in. [mm) \n(1) \n8.2 The permissible variations from the calculated weight \nper foot [kilogram per metre] shall be as prescribed in Table 1. \n9. Permissible Variations in Wall Thickness \n9.1 Variations from the specified minimum wall thickness \nshall not exceed the amounts prescribed in Table 2. \n9.2 For tubes 2 in. [50.8 mm] and over in outside diameter \nand 0.220 in. [5.6 mm] and over in thickness, the variation in \nwall thickness in any one cross section of any one tube shall \nnot exceed the following percentage of the actual mean wall at \nthe section. The actual mean wall is defined as the average of \nthe thickest and thinnest wall in that section. \nSeamless tubes \u00b1 10 % \nWelded tubes \u00b15 % \n9.3 When cold-finished tubes as ordered require wall thick\u00ad\nnesses\u00be in. [19.1 mm] or over, or an inside diameter 60 % or \nless of the outside diameter, the permissible variations in wall \nthickness for hot-finished tubes shall apply. \nTABLE 1 Permissible Variations in Weight Per Unit LengthA \nMethod of Manufacture \nSeamless, hot-finished \nSeamless, cold-finished: \n1 \u00bd in.

Permissible Variations in Outside Diameter \n10.1 Except as provided in 10.2, variations from the speci\u00ad\nfied outside diameter shall not exceed the amounts prescribed \nin Table 3. \n10.2 Thin-wall tubes usually develop significant ovality (out \nof roundness) during final annealing, or straightening, or both. \nThe diameter tolerances of Table 3 are not sufficient to provide \nfor additional ovality expected in thin-wall tubes, and, for such \ntubes, are applicable only to the mean of the extreme (maxi\u00ad\nmum and minimum) outside diameter readings in any one cross \nsection. However, for thin wall tubes the difference in extreme \noutside diameter readings (ovality) in any one cross section \nshall not exceed the following ovality allowances: \nOutside Diameter \n1 in. [25.4 mm] and under \nOver 1 in. [25.4 mm] \nOvality Allowance \n0.020 in.
