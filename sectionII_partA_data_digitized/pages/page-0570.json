A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers ferritic steel forgings for \nboilers, pressure vessels, high-temperature parts, and associ\u00ad\nated equipment. \n1.2 Forgings made of steel grades listed in Specification \nA335/A335M may also be ordered under this specification. \nThe chemical, tensile, heat treatment, and marking require\u00ad\nments of Specification A335/A335M shall apply, except the \nforging shall conform to the chemical requirements of Tables 1 \nand 2 of Specification A335/A335M only with respect to heat \nanalysis. On product analysis they may deviate from these \nlimits to the extent permitted in Table 1 of this specification. \n1.3 Supplementary Requirements S 1 to S 10 are provided for \nuse when additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall \napply only when specified individually by the purchaser in the \norder. \n1.4 Unless the order specifies the applicable \"M\" specifica\u00ad\ntion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch\u00ad\npound units. \n1.5 Specification A336/ A336M formerly included austenitic \nsteel forgings, which are now found in Specification A965/ \nA965M. \n1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to \nensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be \nused independently of the other, and values from the two \nsystems shall not be combined. \n1.7 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0J.06 on Steel Forgings and Billets. \nCurrent edition approved Nov.
