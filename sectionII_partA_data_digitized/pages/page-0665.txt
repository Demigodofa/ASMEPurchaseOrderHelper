Norn I-Cross-sectional area may be calculated by multiplying A and t. 
Norn 2-The dimension t is the thick11ess of the test specimen as provided for in the applicable material specifications. 
NoTE 3-The reduced section shall be parallel within 0.010 in. and may have a gradual taper in width from the ends toward the center, with the ends 
not more than 0.010 in. wider than the center. 
Norn 4-The ends of the specimen shall be symmetrical with the center line of the reduced section within 0.10 in. 
Norn 5-Metric equivalent: 1 in. = 25.4 mm. 
Norn 6-Specimens with sides parallel throughout their length are permitted, except for referee testing, provided: (a) the above tolerances are used; 
(b) an adequate number of marks are provided for determination of elongation; and (c) when yield strength is determined, a suitable extensometer is used. 
If the fracture occurs at a distance of less than 2A from the edge of the gripping device, the tensile properties determined may not be representative of 
the material. If the properties meet the minimum requirements specified, no further testing is required, but if they are less than the minimum requirements, 
discard the test and retest. 
Norn ?-Specimen 5 is intended for testing specimens removed from an in-service product. Specimen 5 shall not be used for conformance testing of 
new product. Acceptance criteria for elongation values obtained from 1 in. gauge length specimens shall be determined by agreement between the 
responsible parties.

through the pressure line under the control of a suitable valve. 
An accurately calibrated pressure gauge serves to measure oil 
pressure. Any air in the system is removed through the bleeder 
line. As the oil pressure is increased, the rubber gasket expands 
which in turn stresses the specimen circumferentially. As the 
pressure builds up, the lips of the rubber gasket act as a seal to 
prevent oil leakage. With continued increase in pressure, the 
ring specimen is subjected to a tension stress and elongates 
accordingly. The entire outside circumference of the ring 
specimen is considered as the gauge length and the strain is 
measured with a suitable extensometer which will be described 
later. When the desired total strain or extension under load is 
reached on the extensometer, the oil pressure in pounds per 
square inch is read and by employing Barlow's formula, the 
unit yield strength is calculated. The yield strength, thus 
determined, is a true result since the test specimen has not been

condition as the tubular section from which it is cut. Further, 
the test closely simulates service conditions in pipe lines. One 
testing machine unit may be used for several different sizes of 
pipe by the use of suitable rubber gaskets and adapters.
