Scope \n1.1 This specification covers chemical and mechanical \nrequirements for eight grades of carbon and alloy steel \nnuts for general structural and mechanical uses on bolts, \nstuds, and other externally threaded parts. \nNOTE 1 - See Appendix Xl for guidance on suitable application of \nnut grades. \n1.2 The requirements for any grade of nut may, at the \nsupplier's option, and with notice to the purchaser, be \nfulfilled by furnishing nuts of one of the stronger grades \nspecified herein unless such substitution is barred in the \ninquiry and purchase order. \n1.3 Grades C3 and DH3 nuts have atmospheric corro\u00ad\nsion resistance and weathering characteristics comparable \nto that of the steels covered in Specifications \nA 242/ A 242M, A 588/ A 588M, and A 709 / A 709M. The \natmospheric corrosion resistance of these steels is substan\u00ad\ntially better than that of carbon steel with or without copper \naddition (see 5.2). When properly exposed to the atmo\u00ad\nsphere, these steels can be used bare (uncoated) for many \napplications. \nNOTE 2 - A complete metric compan.ion to Specification A 563 has \n_ -bet\\n. dev\u20ac\\lo13ed-A 563M; therefore, no metric equIValenfs are presentea \nin this specification. \n1.4 Terms used in this specification are defined in Ter\u00ad\nminology F 1789 unless otherwise defined herein. \n2.
