Scope \n1.1 This specification covers hot-wrought, ferritic alloy \nsteel bars for elevated temperature or pressure-containing parts \nsuitable for fusion welding or both. \n1.2 The bars are furnished in the following grades: \nGrade B 11: 1.25 % chromium, 0.55 % molybdenum \nGrade B 22: 2.25 % chromium, 1.00 % molybdenum \n1.3 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded \nas standard. The values given in. parentheses are mathematical \n.conversions to SI units that are provided for information only \nand are not considered standard. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA29/A29M Specification for Steel Bars, Carbon and Alloy, \nHot-Wrought, General Requirements for \nA370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Testing \nof Steel Products \u2022 \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for material under this specification should \ninclude the following information: \n3.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), \n3.1.2 Name of material (ferritic alloy steel bars), \n3.1.3 Condition (hot wrought, normalized and tempered, \nmachine straightened and descaled), \n3.1.4 Dimensions (cross-sectional shape, size, and length), \n3.1.5 ASTM designation and date of issue, \n3.1.6 Grade (Table 1), \n3.1.7 Additions to the specification, and \n3.1.8 End use. \nNom 1-A typical description is as follows: 10 000 lb, Fenitic Alloy \nSteel Bars, Hot Wrought Normalized and Tempered, and Descaled, \n1.000-in. diameter by IO ft, ASTM A739 dated_, Grade Bll, Special \nStraightened, Special Machined Fittings. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Melting Practice-The steel shall be made by one or \nmore of the following primary processes: open-hearth, basic\u00ad\noxygen, or electric-furnace. The primary melting may incor\u00ad\nporate separate degassing or refining and may be followed by \nsecondary melting using electroslag remelting or vacuum arc \nremelting. Where secondary melting is employed, the heat \nshall be defined as all of the ingots remelted from a single \nprimary heat. \n4.2 Condition-Unless otherwise specified, bars shall be hot \nwrought, heat treated, and descaled. \n4.3 Heat Treatment: \n4.3.1 The bars shall be normalized and tempered. \n4.3.2 Austenitizing temperature shall be within the range \nfrom 1700 to 1800\u00b0F (927 to 982\u00b0C). \n4.3.3 Cooling from the austenitizing temperature may be \naccomplished by cooling in still air or moving air, at the \nproducer's option. When permitted by the purchaser, cooling \nfrom the austenitizing temperature may be accelerated by spray \nor liquid quenching. \n4.3.4 The minimum tempering temperature shall be 1200\u00b0F \n(649\u00b0C) for Grade Bll and 1250\u00b0F (677\u00b0C) for Grade B22. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 The heat analysis shall conform to the limits for chemi\u00ad\ncal composition specified in Table 1 for the grade ordered. \n6. Mechanical Properties \n6.1 Tensile Requirements-The bars as represented by the \ntest specimens shall conform to the tensile requirements \nspecified in Table 2. \n6.2 Specimens-Tension test specimens shall be taken lon\u00ad\ngitudinally and machined from the locations specified in Test \nMethods and Definitions A370. \n1208 ",
