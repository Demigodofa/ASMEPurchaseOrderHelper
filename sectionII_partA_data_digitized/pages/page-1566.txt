SA-1010/SA-1010M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR HIGHER-STRENGTH 
MARTENSITIC STAINLESS STEEL PLATE, 
SHEET, AND STRIP 
SA-1010/SA-l0l0M 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 1010/AlOlOM-01(2009) except for an editorial correction to a column heading in Table 2.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers martensitic stainless steels 
for various structural, architectural, pressure vessel, and 
heat-resisting applications. The mechanical properties of 
these steels are customarily, but not necessarily, developed 
by a suitable heat treatment generally referred to as tem­
pering. 
1.2 Steel products under this specification are available 
in two grades: 
Grade 
40 [275) 
50 [350] 
Yield Strength, min, ksi 
[MPa] 
40 [275) 
50 [350) 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only 
by the capacity of the composition to meet the specified 
mechanical property requirements; however, current prac­
tice normally limits the maximum thickness of plates fur­
nished under this specification to 1 in. [25 mm]. 
1.4 The values stated in inch-pound or SI units are to 
be regarded separately as the standard. Within the text, SI 
units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
must be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in nonconformance with 
the specification. The inch-pound units shall apply unless 
the "M" designation of this specification is specified in the 
purchase order.
