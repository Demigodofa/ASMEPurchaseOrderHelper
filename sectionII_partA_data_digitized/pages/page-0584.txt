test temperature is at least as low as the intended service 
temperature, and that the forging is suitably marked to identify 
the reported test temperature. 
7.2.1.1 The test specimens shall be machined from material 
obtained as in 7.1. 
7 .2.2 Number of Tests-Three specimens shall constitute 
one test set. There shall be the same number of test sets as 
tension tests in 7.1.2. 
7.2.3 Test Locations and Orientations-The test specimen 
shall be located and oriented as described in 7.1.3. The area 
under the notch of the impact test specimen shall be used to 
locate the specimen with respect to the second heat-treated 
surface. The base of the notch shall be perpendicular to the 
nearest heat-treated surface. 
7.2.4 Test Method-The notched bar impact test shall be 
made in accordance with the procedure for the Charpy V-notch 
type test as specified in Specification A961/A961M. 
7.2.4.1 Standard size specimens shall be used for the impact 
test. Where the material is of insufficient thickness, or the 
shape of the forging precludes standard size, the largest 
obtainable subsize specimen shall be used. 
7.2.4.2 Where subsize specimens are used and represent 
forged material with thicknesses equal to or greater than 
0.394 in. [10 mm], and where the largest obtainable specimen 
has a width along the notch of at least 8 mm, such specimen 
shall be tested at the temperature in Table 4. Where the largest 
obtainable specimen has a width along the notch less than 
8 mm, the temperature for testing shall be lower than the 
temperature in Table 4 by the amount shown in Table 6 for the 
actual specimen width tested. 
532 
7 .2.4.3 Where subsize specimens are used and represent 
forged material with thicknesses less than 0.394 in. [10 mm], 
and where the largest obtainable specimen has a width along 
the notch of at least 80 % of the forging thickness, the 
specimen shall be tested at the temperature in Table 4. Where 
the largest obtainable specimen has a width along the notch of 
less than 80 % of the material thickness, the temperature for 
testing shall be lower than the temperature in Table 4 by an 
amount equal to the difference (referring to Table 6) between 
the temperature reduction corresponding to the thickness of the 
material represented, and the temperature reduction corre­
sponding to the specimen width actually tested. 
7.3 Hardness Test: 
7.3.l Except when only one forging is produced, a mini­
mum of two forgings shall be hardness tested per batch or 
continuous run as defined in 7 .1.2.1 to ensure that hardness of 
the forgings does not exceed 197 HBW after heat treatment for 
mechanical properties. The hardness measurements shall be 
made as specified in Specification A961/A961M. When only 
one forging is produced, it shall be hardness tested to ensure 
that it meets the 197 HB W maximum of this specification. The 
purchaser may verify that this requirement has been met by 
testing at any location on the forging, provided that such 
testing does not render the forging useless. 
8. Hydrostatic Test 
8.1 Forgings manufactured under this specification shall be 
capable of passing a hydrostatic test compatible with the rating
