SPECIFICATION FOR HIGH-STRENGTH QUENCHED 
AND TEMPERED LOW-ALLOY STEEL FORGED 
FITTINGS AND PARTS FOR PRESSURE VESSELS 
SA-592/SA-592M 0

[Identical with ASTM Specification A 592/ A 592M-04(2009).] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers high-strength quenched 
and tempered low-alloy steel forged fittings and parts for 
pressure vessels. The maximum thickness of forgings under 
this specification shall be 1½ in. [38 mm] for Grade A, 
and 4 in. [100 mm] for Grades E and F. 
NOTE 1- These grades are similar to corresponding grades in Specifica­
tion A 517 /A 517M. 
1.2 Although no provision is made for supplementary 
requirements in this standard, the supplementary require­
ments in Specification A 788 may be considered by the 
purchaser. 
1.3 Welding technique is of fundamental importance 
and it is presupposed that welding procedures will be in 
accordance with approved methods for the class of mate­
rial used. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
(metric) units are to be regarded separately as the standard; 
within the text and tables, the SI units are shown in [brack­
ets]. The values stated in each system are not exact equiva­
lents; therefore, each system must be used independently 
of the other. Combining values from the two systems may 
result in nonconformance with the specification. 
1.5 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" speci­
fication designation, the material shall be furnished to the 
inch-pound units.

3. Ordering Information and General 
Requirements 
3.1 In addition to the ordering information required by 
Specification A 788, the purchaser shall include with the 
inquiry and order the following information: 
3.1.1 A detailed drawing, a sketch, or written descrip­
tion of the forging. 
3.1.2 The charpy impact test temperature if a test 
temperature lower than 32°F [0°C) is required. 
3.1.3 Additional heat treatment cycles to be applied 
to the mechanical test specimens following removal from 
the heat-treated forging or special forged test block. 
3.1.4 Required supplementary requirement(s) from 
specification A 788. 
3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform 
to the requirements of Specification A 788, which outlines 
additional ordering information, manufacturing require­
ments, testing and retesting methods and procedures, mark­
ing, certification, product analysis variations, and 
additional supplementary requirements. Failure to comply 
with the requirements of Specification A 788 constitutes 
non-conformance with this specification. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in con­
flict with the requirements of Specification A 788, the 
requirements of this specification shall prevail.
