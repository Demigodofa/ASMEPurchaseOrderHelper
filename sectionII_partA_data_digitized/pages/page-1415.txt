A Determined by either the 0.2 % offset method or the 0.5 % extension-under-load 
method. 
7. Number of Tests and Retests 
. 7.1 One tension test shall be made from each heat. 
7 .2 If any test specimen is defectively machined, it may be 
discarded and another specimen substituted. 
8. Retests 
8.1 When one or more representative test specimens do not 
conform to specification requirements for the tested 
characteristic, only a single retest for each nonconfonning 
characteristic may be performed to establish product accept­
ability. Retests shall be performed on twice the number of 
representative specimens that were originally nonconforming. 
When any retest specimen does not conform to specification 
requirements for the characte1istic in question, the lot repre­
sented by that specimen shall be rejected, or the test material 
shall be heat treated or reheat-treated in accordance with 4.4, 
and tested in accordance with Sections 6 and 7. 
9. Test Specimens 
9 .1 The test material to be used for qualifying the forgings 
shall be heat treated with the forgings represented by the test 
material, if the forgings are heat treated, then, the test material 
shall be normalized three times froljll a 1ninimum temperature 
of 1550 °P [845 °C) prior to testfng. ,This heat treatment 
simulates glass-coating operations. 
10. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion 
Protection 
10.1 The requirements of Specification A961/A961M apply 
to forgings and finished parts. 
11. Repair by Welding 
11.1 Approval by the purchaser shall be required prior to 
weld repair. 
11.2 The welded test plate used to qualify the procedure 
shall be normalized three times at 1550 °P [845 °C) prior to 
testing to simulate glass-coating operations. 
11.3 The composition of the weld deposits shall be similar 
to the base metal and in accordance with the procedure 
qualification for the applicable material. Welding shall be 
accomplished with a weld procedure designed to produce low 
hydrogen in the weldment. Short-circuit gas metal arc welding 
is permissible only with the approval of the purchaser. 
12. Rejection and Rehearing 
12.1 Samples representing material rejected by the pur­
chaser shall be preserved until disposition of the claim has been 
agreed upon by the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
13. Certification 
13.1 See Specification A961/A961M. 
13.2 A test rep01t of the test results for chemistry (Section 5 
and Table 1) and tensile properties (Section 6 and Table 2) shall 
be furnished. 
14. Product Marking 
14.1 In addition to marking requirements of Specification 
A961/A961M, the following additional marking requirements 
shall apply: 
14.1.1 Forgings repaired by welding shall be marked with 
the letter "W" following this specification number. 
14.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 14.1, 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. The bar coding system, if applied at 
the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one of 
the published industry standards for bar coding. If used on 
small parts, the bar code may be applied to the box or a 
substantially applied tag.
