ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-671/SA-671M (ASTM A671/A671M) 
7 .2 Product Analyses of Weld-The pipe manufacturer shall 
make an analysis of finished deposited weld material from each 
200 ft [60 m] or fraction thereof. Analyses shall conform to the 
welding procedure for deposited weld metal. 
7.3 Analysis may be taken from the mechanical test speci­
mens. The results of the analyses shall be reported to the 
purchaser. 
8. Mechanical Requirements 
8.1 Tension Test: 
8.1.1 All welded pipe manufactured to this specification 
must have a cross weld tensile test after final heat treatment, 
and the results must match the base material requirements for 
ultimate tensile strength of the specified plate material. 
Additionally, grades CD XX and CJ XXX, when these are of 
Class 3x, 4x, or 5x, and Grade CP of 6x and 7x shall have a 
transverse base metal tensile test performed on specimens cut 
from finished pipe. The results of these tests shall meet the 
minimum mechanical test requirements of the plate specifica­
tion. 
8.1.2 Number of Tests-One test specimen of weld metal 
and one specimen of base metal, if required by 8.1.1, shall be 
made and tested to represent each lot of finished pipe. 
8.1.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation-The test 
specimens shall be taken transverse to the weld at the end of 
the finished pipe and may be flattened cold before final 
machining to size. 
8.1.4 Test Method-The test specimen shall be made in 
accordance with QW-150 in Section IX of the ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code. The test specimen shall be tested at 
room temperature in accordance with Test Methods and Defi­
nitions A370. 
8.2 Transverse Guided Weld Bend Test: 
8.2.1 Requirements-The bend test shall be acceptable if no 
cracks or other defects exceeding 1/s in. [3 mm] in any direction 
are present in the weld metal or between the weld and the base 
metal after bending. Cracks that originate along the edges of 
the specimen during testing, and that are less than¼ irr. [6 mm] 
measured in any direction shall not be considered. 
8.2.2 Number of Tests-One test (two specimens) shall be 
made to represent each lot of finished pipe. 
8.2.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation-Two bend 
test specimens shall be taken transverse to the weld at the end 
of the finished pipe. As an alternative, by agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer, the test specimens may be 
taken from a test plate of the same material as the pipe, the test 
plate being attached to the end of the cylinder and welded as a 
prolongation of the pipe longitudinal seam. 
8.2.4 Test Method-The test requirements of A370, A2.5.1. 7 
shall be met. For wall thicknesses over 3 /s in. [10 mm] but less 
than¾ in. [19 mm] side-bend tests may be made instead of the 
face and root-bend tests. For wall thicknesses¾ in. [19 mm] 
and over both specimens shall be subjected to the side-bend 
test. 
8.3 Pressure Test-Classes X2 and X3 pipe shall be tested in 
accordance with Specification A530/A530M, Hydrostatic Test 
Requirements. 
9. Radiographic Examination 
9.1 The full length of each weld of Classes Xl and X2 shall 
be radiographically examined in accordance with and meet the 
requirements of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
Section VIII, Paragraph UW-51. 
9.2 Radiographic examination may be performed prior to 
heat treatment. 
10. Rework 
10.1 Elimination of Surface lmpeifections-Vnacceptable 
surface imperfections shall be removed by grinding or machin­
ing. The remaining thickness of the section shall be no less than 
the minimum specified in Section 11. The depression after 
grinding or machining shall be blended uniformly into the 
surrounding surface. 
10.2 Repair of Base Metal Defects by Welding: 
10.2.1 The manufacturer may repair, by welding, base metal 
where defects have been removed, provided the depth of the 
repair cavity as prepared for welding does not exceed 1/3 of the 
nominal thickness and the requirements of 10.2.2, 10.2.3, 
10.2.4, 10.2.5 and 10.2.6 are met. Base metal defects in excess 
of these may be repaired with prior approval of the customer. 
10.2.2 The defect shall be removed by suitable mechanical 
or thermal cutting or gouging methods and the cavity prepared 
for repair welding. 
10.2.3 The welding procedure and welders or welding 
operators are to be qualified in accordance with Section IX of 
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
10.2.4 The full length of the repaired pipe shall be heat 
treated after repair in accordance with the requirements of the 
pipe class specified. 
10.2.5 Each repair weld of a defect where the cavity, 
prepared for welding, has a depth exceeding the lesser of 3/s in. 
[10 mm] or 10 % of the nominal thickness shall be examined 
by radiography in accordance with the methods and the 
acceptance standards of Section 9. 
10.2.6 The repair surface shall be blended uniformly into 
the surrounding base metal surface and examined and accepted 
in accordance with Supplementary Requirements S6 or S8. 
10.3 Repair of Weld Metal Defects by Welding: 
10.3.1 The manufacturer may repair weld metal defects ifhe 
meets the requirements of 10.2.3, 10.2.4, 10.3.2, 10.3.3 and 
10.4. 
10.3.2 The defect shall be removed by suitable mechanical 
or thermal cutting or gouging methods and the repair cavity 
examined and accepted in accordance with Supplementary 
Requirements S7 or S9. 
10.3.3 The weld repair shall be blended uniformly into the 
surrounding metal surfaces and examined and accepted in 
accordance with 9.1 and with Supplementary Requirements S7 
or S9. 
10.4 Retest-Bach length of repaired pipe of a class requir­
ing a pressure test shall be hydrostatically tested following 
repair.
