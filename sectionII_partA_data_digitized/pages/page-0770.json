Keywords \n15.1 bolts-steel; chromium alloy steel; bolting \ncomponents-steel; marking on bolting components; nuts\u00ad\nsteel; stainless steel; steel bars-alloy; steel bolting material; \ntemperature service applications-high; turbine materials \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nOne or more of the following supplementary requirements shall be applied only when specified by \nthe purchaser in the inquiry, contract, or order; in which event the specified tests shall be made before \nshipment of the product. \nSl. Non-Destructive Examination \nS 1.1 NDE is required following all machining and thread\u00ad\ning. The acceptance criteria of 12.1 shall apply. \nS2. Stress Rupture Testing-Grade B4B \nS2.1 Stress rupture testing shall be conducted at 1200 \u00b0F \n[650 \u00b0C] and 26 000 psi [180 MPa] using a combination test \nbar in accordance with Test Methods E292. Rupture shall occur \nin the smooth section of each test specimen. The test may be \n720 \ndiscontinued after 25 h provided the certification so notes. \u00b7 \nStress rupture testing is not required on bars less than \u00bd in. \n[12.7 mm] in diameter or thickness. \nS3. Grain Size-Grades B4B and B4C \nS3.l The average grain size shall be 4 or finer. The \nmaximum size of individual grains, distributed at random, shall \nbe a 2. When the average grain size is 5 or finer, only the \naverage size need be reported. Grain size determination shall \nbe performed in accordance with Test Methods El12. ",
