Mechanical Properties \n7.1 The iron represented by test coupons shall conform \nto tensile requirements prescribed in Table 1. \n7.2 The yield strength prescribed in Table 1 may be \ndetermined by any of the approved procedures described \nin 7.3 of Test Methods E 8. \n7.3 The Brinell hardness of the material shall be a \nminimum of 201 HB. Hardness tests shall be conducted \nin accordance with Test Method E 10, using a 3000 kgf \nload. The test may be made on either the casting or on a \ntest coupon representing the casting. \n8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n8.1 The castings shall conform to the dimensions on \nthe drawings furnished by the purchaser, or if no drawing \nhas been provided, to the dimensions predicated by the \npattern supplied by the purchaser. Surfaces of the castings \nshall be free of adhering sand. Runners, risers, fins, and \nother extraneous metal shall be removed. \n9. Sampling \n9.1 Test coupons shall be poured from the same iron \nas the castings represented. \n9.2 Test coupons shall be cast either to the \"Y\" block \nsize and shape shown in Fig. 1 or to the dimensions of the \n1 in. [25-mm] keel block shown in Fig. 2. The type of test \ncoupon and, when selected, the size of the \"Y\" block shall \nbe specified by the purchaser. \n9.3 The test coupons shall be cast in open molds made \nof suitable core sand with a minimum 1\u00bd in. [38 mm] of \nsand for the 1 in. [25 mm] size and 3 in. [75 mm] of sand \nfor the 3 in. [75 mm] size. The coupons shall be left in \nthe mold until black. \n9.4 Table 2 shows the equivalent geometrical shapes \nwith various dimensions and the equivalent \"Y\" block, \nbased on cooling rates, and may be used as a guide for \nselection of the proper \"Y\" block to be specified to repre\u00ad\nsent the casting. \n9.5 When the castings are heat treated, the test coupons \nshall be heat treated with the castings they represent. \n10. Tension Test \n10.1 Tension test specimens shall be obtained from test \ncoupons shown in either Fig. 1 or Fig. 2, and machined \nto the dimensions shown in Fig. 3. Test coupons cast as \n\"Y\" blocks (Fig. 1) shall be sectioned as shown in Fig. 4. \n10.2 One tension test shall be performed for each \ncasting. \n10.3 If any specimen shows defective machining or \nflaws, it may be discarded and another substituted from \nthe same casting represented. \n10.4 If an apparently sound test specimen fails to con\u00ad\nform to the tensile requirements, two retests may be made. \nIf either retest fails to conform to the requirements speci\u00ad\nfied, the castings shall be rejected. \n11. Repairs \n11.1 Castings made to this specification that leak on \nsubsequent hydrostatic testing may be repaired by using \nthreaded plugs provided the following requirements are \nmet. \n11.1.1 No welding or brazing shall be permitted. \n11.1.2 The diameter of the plug shall not exceed \nthe diameter of a standard 2 in. [ISO R2] iron pipe size \npipe plug. \n11.1.3 The plugs, where practical, shall conform in \nall dimensions to the standard iron pipe size pipe plugs. \nIn addition, they shall have full thread engagement corres\u00ad\nponding to the thickness of the repaired section. Where a \ntapered plug is impractical because of the excess wall \nthickness in terms of plug diameter and coincident thread \nengagement, other types of plugs may be used provided \nboth full thread engagement and effective sealing against \npressure are obtained. Where possible the ends of the plugs \nshould be ground smooth after installation to conform to \nthe inside and outside contours of the cylinder. \n11.1.4 The material from which the plug is manufac\u00ad\ntured shall conform in all respects to this specification. \n769 \n11.1.5 The area adjacent to the drilled hole should \nbe examined radiographically in accordance with Guide \nE 94. The area examined shall meet the requirements of \nSeverity Level 3 of Reference Radiographs E 446. \n11.1.6 The thickness of any repaired section in rela\u00ad\ntion to the size of plug used shall be not less than that \ngiven in Table 3. \n11.1.7 The minimum radius of curvature of the \nrepaired section of the cylinder in relation to the size of \nplug used shall be not less than that given in Table 4. \n11.1.8 A repaired area may consist of a maximum \nof three plugs with a spacing such that the distance between \nadjacent plugs shall not be less than those listed in Table \n5. Adjacent areas of repair, in which each contains more \nthan one plug, shall be separated by at least twice the \ndistance required in Table 5 for the two nearest plugs \nseparating the two areas. \n11.2 Surface imperfections not exceeding 20% of the \nthickness of the section and other minor defects may be \nrepaired by plugging provided the diameter of the plug \ndoes not exceed its length.
