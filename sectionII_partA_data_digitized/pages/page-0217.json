Terminology \n3.1 Definitions-For definitions of other terms used in this \nspecification, refer to Specification A961/A961M. \n3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.2.1 heaviest cross-section, n-maximum heat treated \nthickness of the production forging. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 See Specification A961/A961M. \n4.1.1 Additional requirements (see 14.2). \n5. General Requirements \n5.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A961/A961M, including any \nsupplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase \norder. Failure to comply with the requirements of Specification \nA961/A961M constitutes nonconformance with this specifica\u00ad\ntion. In case of a conflict between the requirements of this \nspecification and Specification A961/A961M, this specification \nshall prevail. \n5.2 Except as permitted by Section 6 in Specification \nA961/A961M, the finished product shall be a forging as \ndefined in the Terminology Section of Specification A788/ \nA788M. \n6. Heat Treatment \n6.1 Heat treatment is not a mandatory requirement of this \nspecification except for the following piping components: \n6.1.1 Flanges above Class 300, \n6.1.2 Flanges of special design where the design pressure at \nthe design temperature exceeds the pressure-temperature rat\u00ad\nings of Class 300, Group 1.1, \n6.1.3 Flanges of special design where the design pressure or \ndesign temperature are not known, \nTABLE 1 Chemical Requirements \nNoTE 1-For each reduction of 0.01 % below the specified carbon \nmaximum (0.35 %), an increase of 0.06 % manganese above the specified \nmaximum (1.05 %) will be permitted up to a maximum of 1.65 %. \nElement \nCarbon \nManganese \nPhosphorus \nSulfur \nSilicon \nCopper \nNickel \nChromium \nMolybdenum \nVanadium \nComposition, % \n0.35 max \n0.60--1.05 \n0.035 max \n0.040 max \n0.10-0.35 \n0.40 maxA \n0.40 maxA \n0.30 maxA,a \n0.12 maxA,a \n0.08 maxA \nA The sum of copper, nickel, chromium, molybdenum and vanadium shall not \nexceed 1.00 %. \n8 The sum of chromium and molybdenum shall not exceed 0.32 %. \n6.1.4 Piping components other than flanges which meet \nboth of the following criteria: (/) over NPS 4 and (2). above \nClass 300, and \n6.1.5 Piping components of Special Class other than \nflanges which meet both of the following criteria: (/) over NPS \n4 and (2) when the working pressure at the operating tempera\u00ad\nture exceeds the tabulated values for Special Class 300, Group \n1.1. \n6.2 Heat treatment, when required by 6.1 shall be annealing, \nnormalizing, or normalizing and tempering or quenching and \ntempering in accordance with Specification A961/A961M. \nAfter hot working and before reheating for heat treatment, the \nforging shall be allowed to cool substantially below the \ntransformation range. \n6.2.1 Quenching shall consist of either ( 1) fully austenitiz\u00ad\ning the forgings followed by quenching in a suitable liquid \nmedium or (2) using a multiple stage procedure whereby the \nforgings are first fully austenitized and rapidly cooled, then \nreheated to partially reaustenitize, followed by quenching in a \nsuitable liquid medium. All quenched forgings shall be tem\u00ad\npered as prescribed in Specification A961/A961M. \n7. Chemical Composition \n7 .1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements \nspecified in Table 1. \n7 .2 Steels to which lead has been added shall not be used. \n8. Mechanical Properties \n8.1 The material shall conform to the mechanical property \nrequirements prescribed in Table 2 and Table 3. \n8.2 For normalized, normalized and tempered, or quenched \nand tempered forgings, the central axis of the test specimen \nshall be taken at least \u00bc T from the nearest surface as-heat\u00ad\ntreated, where Tis the maximum heat-treated thickness of the \nrepresented forging. In addition, for quenched and tempered \nforgings, the midlength of the test specimen shall be at least T \nfrom all other surfaces as-heat-treated, exclusive of the T \ndimension surfaces.
