Rockwell Test \n18.1 Description: \n18.1.1 In this test a hardness value is obtained by determin\u00ad\ning the depth of penetration of a diamond point or a tungsten \ncarbide ball into the specimen under certain arbitrarily fixed \nconditions. A minor load of 10 kgf is first applied which causes \nan initial penetration, sets the penetrator on the material and \nholds it in position. A major load which depends on the scale \nbeing used is applied increasing the depth of indentation. The \nmajor load is removed and, with the minor load still acting, the \nRockwell number, which is proportional to the difference in \npenetration between the major and minor loads is determined; \nthis is usually done by the machine and shows on a dial, digital \n1/15-in.

This is an arbitrary number \nwhich increases with increasing hardness. The scales most \nfrequently used are as follows: \nB \nC \nPenetrator \n1/15-in. tungsten carbide ball \nDiamond brale \nMaior \nLoad, kg! \n100 \n150 \n10 \n10 \n18 .1.2 Rockwell superficial hardness machines are used for \nthe testing of very thin steel or thin surface layers. Loads of 15, \n30, or 45 kgf are applied on a tungsten carbide ( or a hardened \nsteel) ball or diamond penetrator, to cover the same range of \nhardness values as for the heavier loads. Use of a hardened \nsteel ball is permitted only for testing thin sheet tin mill \nproducts as found in Specifications A623 and A623M using \nHR15T and HR30T scales with a diamond spot anvil. (Testing \nof this product using a tungsten carbide indenter may give \nsignificantly different results as compared to historical test data \nobtained using a hardened steel ball.) The superficial hardness \nscales are as follows: \nScale Maior Minor \nSymbol Penetrator Load, kgf Load, kg! \n15T 1/1B\u00b7in. tungsten carbide or steel ball 15 3 \n30T 1/1a-in. tungsten carbide or steel ball 30 3 \n45T 1/1s-in. tungsten carbide ball 45 3 \n15N Diamond brale 15 3 \n30N Diamond brale 30 3 \n45N Diamond brale 45 3 \n18.2 Reporting Hardness-In recording hardness values, the \nhardness number shall always precede the scale symbol, for \nexample: 96 HRBW, 40 HRC, 75 HR15N, 56 HR30TS, or 77 \nHR30TW. The suffix W indicates use of a tungsten carbide ball. \nThe suffix S indicates use of a hardened steel ball as permitted \nin 18.1.2. \n599 ",
