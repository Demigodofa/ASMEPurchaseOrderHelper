3. Appurtenant Materials 
3.1 When components of a steel structure are identified with 
this ASTM designation but the product form is not listed in the 
scope of this specification, the material shall conform to one of 
the standards listed in Table 1 unless otherwise specified by the 
purchaser. 
4. General Requirements for Delivery 
4.1 . Structural products furnished under this specification 
shall conform to the requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A6/ A6M, for the specific structural product 
ordered, unless a conflict exists in which case this specification 
shall prevail. 
4.2 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into a finished structural product. 
Structural products produced from coil means structural prod­
ucts that have been cut to individual lengths from a coil. The 
processor directly controls, or is responsible for, the operations 
involved in the processing of a coil into a finished structural 
product. Such operations include decoiling, leveling or 
straightening, hot-forming or cold-forming (if applicable), 
cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, heat treat­
ment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for shipment, 
and certification. 
NoTE 1-For structural products produced from coil and furnished 
without heat treatment or with stress relieving only, two test results are to 
be reported for each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding 
structural products produced from coil are described in Specification 
A6/A6M.

A See the Orientation subsection in the Tension Tests section of Specification 
A6/A6M. 
8 For wide flange shapes with flange thickness over 3 in. [75 mm], the 80 ksi [550 
MPa] maximum tensile strength does not apply and a minimum elongation in 2 In. 
[50 mm] of 19 % applies. 
cvield point 32 ksi [220 MPa] for plates over 8 in. [200 mm] in thickness. 
0 Elongation not required to be determined for floor plate. 
E For plates wider than 24 in. [600 mm], the elongation requirement is reduced two 
percentage points. See the Elongation Requirement Adjustments subsection 
under the Tension Tests section of Specification A6/A6M. 
5. Bearing Plates 
5.1 Unless otherwise specified, plates used as bearing plates 
for bridges shall be subjected to mechanical tests and shall 
conform to the tensile requirements of Section 8. 
5.2 Unless otherwise specified, mechanical tests shall not be 
required for plates over 1 ½ in. [40 mm] in thickness used as 
bearing plates in structures other than bridges, subject to the 
requirement that they shall contain 0.20 to 0.33 % carbon by 
heat analysis, that the chemical composition shall conform to 
the requirements of Table 3 in phosphorus and sulfur content, 
and that a sufficient discard shall be made to secure sound 
plates. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 The steel shall be killed. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The heat analysis shall conform to the requirements 
prescribed in Table 3, except as specified in 5.2. 
7.2 The steel shall conform on product analysis to the 
requirements prescribed in Table 3, subject to the product 
analysis tolerances in Specification A6/ A6M. 
8. Tension Test 
127 
8.1 The material as represented by the test specimen, except 
as specified in 5.2 and 8.2, shall conform to the requirements as 
to the tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. 
8.2 Shapes less than 1 in.2 [645 mm 2 ] in cross section and 
bars, other than flats, less than½ in. [12.5 mm] in thickness or 
diameter need not be subjected to tension tests by the 
manufacturer, provided that the chemical composition used is 
appropriate for obtaining the tensile properties in Table 2.
