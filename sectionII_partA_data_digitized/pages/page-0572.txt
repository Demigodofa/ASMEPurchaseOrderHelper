3. Ordering Information and General Requirements 
3.1 In addition to the ordering information required by 
Specification A788/A788M, the purchaser should include with 
the inquiry and order the following information: 
3.1.1 A drawing or sketch that shows test locations when the 
testing is in accordance with 8.2.1.3. 
3.1.2 The intended use of forgings if 5.1 is applicable. 
3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out­
lines additional ordering information, manufacturing 
requirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, 
marking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi­
tional supplementary requirements. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, the 
requirements of this specification shall prevail. 
3.4 For hubbed flatheads and tube sheets ordered for ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code application, Supplementary 
Requirement S12 of Specification A788/A788M shall be 
specified. 
3.5 At the purchaser's request the forgings shall be rough 
machined before heat treatment (5.2). 
3.6 For Section III, Part NB of the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code application, Supplementary Requirement 
S3 shall be specified. 
4. Melting and Forging 
4.1 In addition to the melting and forging requirements of 
Specification A788/A788M, which may be supplemented by 
Supplementary Requirement S8, the following conditions ap­
ply: 
4.1.1 A sufficient discard shall be made to secure freedom 
from injurious pipe and undue segregation. 
5. Machining 
5.1 Forged pressure vessels for steam power service shall 
have the inner surface machined or ground. Unfired pressure 
vessels shall have the inner surfaces sufficiently free of scale to 
permit inspection. 
5.2 Unless otherwise specified by the purchaser, when 
rough machining is performed, it may be done either before or 
after heat treatment at the manufacturer's option. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 Except as permitted in 6.1.1 for Grade F22V, and in 
6.1.2 for Grade F91 Type 1 and Type 2 and Grade F92, the steel 
forgings shall be annealed or normalized and tempered but 
alternatively may be liquid quenched and tempered when 
mutually agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. For all grades, normalizing or liquid quenching shall 
be followed by tempering at a subcritical temperature as shown 
in 6.1.4. 
6.1.1 Grade F22V forgings shall be normalized and tem­
pered or liquid quenched and tempered at the manufacturer's 
option. 
6.1.1.1 For Grade F22V forgings the minimum austenitizing 
temperature shall be 1650 °F [900 °C]. 
6.1.2 Grade F91 Type 1 and Type 2 forgings having any 
section thickness greater than 3 in. [75 mm] shall be normal­
ized and tempered or liquid quenched and tempered at the 
manufacturer's option. Grade F92 forgings shall be normalized 
and tempered or liquid quenched and tempered at the manu­
facturer's option. 
6.1.2.1 For Grade F91 Type 1 and Type 2, F911, and F92 
forgings, the austenitizing temperature shall be in the range of 
1900 °F to 1975 °F [1040 °C to 1080 °C]. 
6.1.3 For Grade F6NM the austenitizing temperature shall 
be 1850 °F [1010 °C] minimum. The tempering temperature 
range shall be as shown in 6.1.4. 
520 
6.1.4 Except for the following grades, the minimum tem­
pering temperature shall be 1100 °F [595 °C]: 
Grade 
F6 
F6NM 
F11, Class 2 
F11, Class 3 
F11, Class 1

7.I Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam­
pling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M and shall 
comply with Table 2. 
7.2 Product Analysis-The manufacturer shall use the prod­
uct analysis provision of Specification A788/A788M to obtain 
a product analysis from a forging representing each heat or 
multiple heat. The product analysis for columbium and calcium 
for Grade F22V shall conform to the requirements of Table 2 
of this specification. Boron is not subject to product analysis. 
The purchaser may also make this determination in accordance 
with Specification A788/A788M. 
8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 General Requirements-The material shall conform to 
the requirements for mechanical properties prescribed in Table 
1. The largest obtainable tension test specimen as specified in 
Test Methods and Definitions A370 shall be used. 
8.2 Sampling-The mid-point of the gauge length of tension 
test specimens and the area under the notch of impact speci­
mens shall be located in accordance with one of the following 
methods as specified by the purchaser, or suggested by the 
supplier and approved by the purchaser. Unless otherwise 
noted, all testing shall be from integral prolongations of the 
forging.
