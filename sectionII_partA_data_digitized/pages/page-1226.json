Heat Treatment of Product \n6.1 Material of types other than Type UNS S46910 shall be \nfurnished in the solution-annealed condition as noted in Tables \n2 and 3 unless otherwise specified by the purchaser on the \npurchase order. \n6.1.1 When continuous heat treating is used, process param\u00ad\neters (that is, furnace temperature set points, heat input, travel \nrate, etc.) for continuous heat treating lines shall be established \nby the material producer and validated by testing of product to \nthe requirements of 7.1. \n6.2 Type UNS S46910 shall be furnished in cold-worked \ncondition. \n7. Mechanical Properties \n7 .1 The material, as represented by mechanical test \nspecimens, shall conform to the mechanical property require-\nments specified in Table 4 and shall be capable of developing \nthe properties in Table 5 when heat treated as specified in 9 .1. \n8. Bending Requirements \n8.1 Samples cut from the solution-annealed plate, sheet, or \nstrip shall withstand cold bending as specified in Table 6 \nwithout cracking on the outside of the bent portion. \n9. Heat Treatment of Test Specimens \n9.1 Samples cut from the plate, sheet, or strip shall conform \nto the mechanical properties of Table 5 when precipitation \nhardened as specified in Table 2 and Table 3. \n10.
