Number of Tests and Retests \n. 7.1 One tension test shall be made from each heat. \n7 .2 If any test specimen is defectively machined, it may be \ndiscarded and another specimen substituted. \n8. Retests \n8.1 When one or more representative test specimens do not \nconform to specification requirements for the tested \ncharacteristic, only a single retest for each nonconfonning \ncharacteristic may be performed to establish product accept\u00ad\nability. Retests shall be performed on twice the number of \nrepresentative specimens that were originally nonconforming. \nWhen any retest specimen does not conform to specification \nrequirements for the characte1istic in question, the lot repre\u00ad\nsented by that specimen shall be rejected, or the test material \nshall be heat treated or reheat-treated in accordance with 4.4, \nand tested in accordance with Sections 6 and 7. \n9. Test Specimens \n9 .1 The test material to be used for qualifying the forgings \nshall be heat treated with the forgings represented by the test \nmaterial, if the forgings are heat treated, then, the test material \nshall be normalized three times froljll a 1ninimum temperature \nof 1550 \u00b0P [845 \u00b0C) prior to testfng. ,This heat treatment \nsimulates glass-coating operations. \n10. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion \nProtection \n10.1 The requirements of Specification A961/A961M apply \nto forgings and finished parts. \n11. Repair by Welding \n11.1 Approval by the purchaser shall be required prior to \nweld repair. \n11.2 The welded test plate used to qualify the procedure \nshall be normalized three times at 1550 \u00b0P [845 \u00b0C) prior to \ntesting to simulate glass-coating operations. \n11.3 The composition of the weld deposits shall be similar \nto the base metal and in accordance with the procedure \nqualification for the applicable material. Welding shall be \naccomplished with a weld procedure designed to produce low \nhydrogen in the weldment. Short-circuit gas metal arc welding \nis permissible only with the approval of the purchaser. \n12. Rejection and Rehearing \n12.1 Samples representing material rejected by the pur\u00ad\nchaser shall be preserved until disposition of the claim has been \nagreed upon by the manufacturer and the purchaser. \n13. Certification \n13.1 See Specification A961/A961M. \n13.2 A test rep01t of the test results for chemistry (Section 5 \nand Table 1) and tensile properties (Section 6 and Table 2) shall \nbe furnished. \n14. Product Marking \n14.1 In addition to marking requirements of Specification \nA961/A961M, the following additional marking requirements \nshall apply: \n14.1.1 Forgings repaired by welding shall be marked with \nthe letter \"W\" following this specification number. \n14.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 14.1, \nbar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification \nmethod. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar \ncoding system to be used. The bar coding system, if applied at \nthe discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one of \nthe published industry standards for bar coding. If used on \nsmall parts, the bar code may be applied to the box or a \nsubstantially applied tag. \n15. Keywords \n15.1 carbon; pipe fittings; p1pmg applications; pressure \ncontaining parts; pressure vessel service; steel; steel flanges; \nsteel forgings; steel valves \n1353 ",
