Scope \n1.1 This standard is a compilation of definitions of terms \nrelated to steel, stainless steel, related alloys, and ferroalloys. \n1.2 When a term is used in an ASTM document for which \nCommittee A0l is responsible, it is included herein only when \njudged, after review by Subcommittee A0l.92, to be a gener\u00ad\nally usable term. \n1.3 Some definitions include a discussion section, which is \na mandatory part of the definition and contains additional \ninformation that is relevant to the meaning of the defined term. \n1.4 Definitions of terms specific to a particular standard will \nappear in that standard and will supersede any definitions of \nidentical terms in this standard. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nE112 Test Methods for Determining Average Grain Size \n3. Terminology \n3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \nAccm\u2022 Ac 1, Ac 3, Ac,r-See transformation temperature. \nAecm, Ae 1 , Ae 3 , Ae,r-See transformation temperature. \nage hardening, n-hardening by aging, usually after rapid \ncooling or cold working. \nage hardening, n-see precipitation hardening. \naging, n-a change in the properties of certain steels that \noccurs at ambient or moderately elevated temperatures after \nhot working or a heat treatment ( quench aging, natural \naging, or artificial aging) or after a cold-working operation \n(strain aging). \nDiscussION-The change in properties is often, but not always, due to \nprecipitation hardening, but never involves a change in the chemical \ncomposition of the steel. \nalloy steel, n-a steel, other than a stainless steel, that \nconforms to a specification that requires one or more of the \nfollowing elements, by mass percent, to have a minimum \ncontent equal to or greater than: 0.30 for aluminum; 0.0008 \nfor boron; 0.30 for chromium; 0.30 for cobalt; 0.40 for \ncopper; 0.40 for lead; 1.65 for manganese; 0.08 for molyb\u00ad\ndenum; 0.30 for nickel; 0.06 for niobium (columbium); 0.60 \nfor silicon; 0.05 for titanium; 0.30 for tungsten (wolfram); \n0.10 for vanadium; 0.05 for zirconium; or 0.10 for any other \nalloying element, except sulphur, phosphorus, carbon, and \nnitrogen. \nannealing, n-a generic term covering any of several heat \ntreatments. \nDiscusSION-This treatment is used for purposes such as reducing \nhardness, improving machinability, facilitating cold working, produc\u00ad\ning a desired microstructure, or obtaining desired mechanical, physical, \nor other properties. Where applicable, it is preferred that the following \nmore specific terms be used: box annealing, bright annealing, full \nannealing, intermediate annealing, isothermal annealing, process \nannealing, spheroidizing, and subcritical annealing. The term \n\"annealing,\" without qualification, implies full annealing. Any pro\u00ad\ncess of annealing will usually reduce stresses; however, if the \ntreatment is applied for the sole purpose of stress reduction, it should be \ndesignated stress relieving. \nArcm, Ar 1 , Ar 3 , Ar,r-See transformation temperature. \nartificial aging, n-aging above room temperature. \natmospheric corrosion resistance, n-the ability to resist \ndegradation or alteration of material through chemical reac\u00ad\ntion with the surrounding atmosphere. \nD1scussioN-This term generally pertains to carbon steel, low alloy \nsteel, or micro-alloyed steel. \naustempering, n-heat treatment involving quenching a \nsteel object from a temperature above the transformation \nrange in a medium maintained at a temperature above the \nmartensite range sufficiently fast to avoid the formation of \n1380 ",
