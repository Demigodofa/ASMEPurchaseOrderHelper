11.2 When agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser, test coupons from which test specimens are pre­
pared shall be cast attached to separate blocks from the same 
heat as the casting represented. The test blocks shall be heat 
treated in the same manner as the casting represented. 
11.3 Tension test specimens shall be machined to the form 
and dimensions of the standard round 2-in. [50-mm] gage 
length specimens shown in Fig. 6 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370. 
12. Hydrostatic Test 
12.1 Each length of pipe shall be hydrostatically tested in 
accordance with Specification A999/ A999M. 
12.2 When agreed to between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser and so stated in the order, the hydrostatic test may be 
defe1Ted and shall be performed later by the purchaser. Pipe 
furnished without the hydrostatic test shall include with the

mandatory marking the letters "NH." The manufacturer is 
responsible for the satisfactory performance of the casting 
when it is tested. 
12.3 When certification is required by the purchaser and the 
hydrostatic test has been omitted, the certification shall clearly 
state "not hydrostatically tested." The specification number and 
material grade shown on the certification shall be followed by 
the letters "NH." 
13. Visual Inspection 
13 .1 The surface of the casting shall be free from cracks and 
hot tears as determined by visual examination. Other surface 
imperfections shall be judged in accordance with visual accep­
tance criteria which may be specified in the order. 
14. Rework and Retreatment 
14. l Defects as defined in Section 13 shall be removed and 
their removal verified by visual inspection of the resultant 
cavities. Defects that are located by inspecting with supple­
mentary requirements S6, S7, SS, or S9 shall be removed or 
reduced to an acceptable size. 
14.2 If removal of the defect does not infringe upon the 
minimum wall thickness, the depression may be blended 
uniformly into the surrounding surface. 
14.3 If the cavity resulting from defect removal infringes 
upon the minimum wall thickness, weld repair is permitted 
subject to the purchaser's approval. The composition of the 
weld rod used shall be suitable for the composition of the metal 
being welded. 
14.3.1 Only welders and procedures qualified in accordance 
with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX, shall 
be used. All repair welds will be inspected to the same quality 
standards used to inspect the casting. 
14.4 Local or full heat treatment in accordance with tem­
pering temperatures specified in 5.1 shall follow welding.
