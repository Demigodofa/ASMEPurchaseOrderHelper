When appropriate, the areas of significant \nloading in the forging shall be designated. \n3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out\u00ad\nlines additional ordering information, manufacturing \nrequirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, \nmarking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi\u00ad\ntional supplementary requirements. \n3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, the \nrequirements of this specification shall prevail. \n4. Manufacture \n4.1 Melting Practice-The steel shall be made to a killed, \nfine austenitic grain size, practice. \n4.1.1 Vacuum degassing in accordance with Specification \nA788/A788M is highly recommended. \n4.2 Heat Treatment: \n4.2.1 Normalizing may, at the manufacturer's option, pre\u00ad\ncede the prescribed heat treatment cycle. \n4.2.2 Grade A Class 1 forgings shall be normalized at a \ntemperature in the range from 1600 to 1725 \u00b0F [870 to 940 \u00b0C] \nand then precipitation hardened in the range from 1000 to \n1225 \u00b0F [540 to 665 \u00b0C] for a time to be determined by the \nmaterial manufacturer. \n4.2.3 Grade A Class 2 forgings shall be liquid quenched \nfrom a temperature in the range from 1600 to 1725 \u00b0F [870 to \n940 \u00b0C] and then precipitation hardened in the range from 1000 \nto 1225 \u00b0F [540 to 665 \u00b0C] for a time to be determined by the \nmaterial manufacturer. \n4.2.4 Grade B forgings shall be double quenched and \ntempered (liquid quenched twice) by austenitizing twice at a \ntemperature in the range of 1600 to 1725 \u00b0F [870 to 940 \u00b0C], \nand then precipitation hardened at a temperature in the range of \n1000 to 1300 \u00b0F [540 to 700 \u00b0C] for a time to be determined by \nthe manufacturer. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam\u00ad\npling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall \ncomply with Table 1. \n5.2 Product Analysis-The purchaser may use the product \nanalysis provision of Specification A788/A788M to obtain a \nproduct analysis from a forging representing each heat or \nmultiple heat. \n6. Mechanical Requirements \n6.1 Tensile Requirements;_The forgings, as represented by \nthe tension test specimens, shall conform to the requirements \nof Table 2. The largest obtainable tension test specimen as \nspecified in Test Methods and Definitions A370 shall be used. \n6.2 Notch Toughness Requirements: \n6.2.1 For Grade A, Class 1 or 2 forgings, unless Supple\u00ad\nmentary Requirement S6 is specified, the Charpy impact test \nresults shall conform to the requirements of Table 3. One set of \nthree specimens shall be removed from each specimen location \nas specified in 6.3. The supplier may select a test temperature \ncolder than that specified in the order, but in any case, the \nactual test temperature shall be reported with the test results. \n6.2.2 For Grade B forgings two sets of Charpy impact \nspecimens shall be removed from each test specimen location \nas specified in and shall conform to the requirements of Table \n3. \n6.2.3 Full-size, 10 by 10 mm, Charpy V-notch specimens \nshall be used unless the material thickness or configuration \nmakes it impossible to obtain full-size specimens. If the use of \nsub-size specimens is necessary, the largest standard sub-size \nspecimen it is possible to obtain shall be used. \n6.2.4 The acceptance values for sub-size specimens shall be \nreduced in direct ratio to the reduction of specimen width. \n6.3 Sampling-The longitudinal axis and the mid-length of \ntension and impact test specimens shall be positioned in \naccordance with one of the following methods as specified by \nthe purchaser: \nTABLE 1 Chemical Requirements \nElement \nCarbon \nManganese \nPhosphorus, max \nSulfur, max \nSilicon, max \nChromium \nNickel \nMolybdenum \nCopper \nColumbium \nVanadium max \nAluminum max \nTitanium max \nTin max \nArsenic max \nAntimony max \nNitrogen \nGrade A \n0.07 max \n0.40-0.70 \n0.025 \n0.025 \n0.40 \n0.60-0.90 \n0.70-1.00 \n0.15-0.25 \n1.00-1.30 \n0.02 min \n1367 \nComposition, % \nGrade B \n0.02-0.04 \n0.75-1.05 \nO.Q15 \n0.002 \n0.40 \n0.45-0.75 \n3.35-3.85 \n0.55-0.65 \n1.15-1.75 \n0.02-0.06 \n0.008 \n0.03 \n0.003 \n0.03 \n0.025 \n0.025 \nreport ",
