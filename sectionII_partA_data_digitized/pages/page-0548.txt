11. Hardness Requirements 
11.1 The tubes shall have a hardness number not 
exceeding those prescribed in Table 4. 
12. Impact Requirements 
12.1 For Grades 1, 3, 6, 7 and 9, the notched-bar impact 
properties of each set of three impact specimens, including 
specimens for the welded joint in welded pipe with wall 
thicknesses of0.120 in. [3 mm] and larger, when tested at 
temperatures in conformance with 14.1 shall be not less 
than the values prescribed in Table 5. The impact test is 
not required for Grade 11. 
12.1.1 If the impact value of one specimen is below 
the minimum value, or the impact values of two specimens 
are less than the minimum average value but not below 
the minimum value permitted on a single specimen, a retest 
shall be allowed. The retest shall consist of breaking three 
additional specimens and each specimen must equal or 
exceed the required average value. When an erratic result 
is caused by a defective specimen, or there is uncertainty 
in test procedures, a retest will be allowed. 
12.2 For Grade 8 each of the notched bar impact speci­
mens shall display a lateral expansion opposite the notch 
not less than 0.Gl5 in. [0.38 mm]. • 
12.2.1 When the average lateral expansion value for 
the three impact specimens equals or exceeds 0.015 in. 
[0.38 mm] and the value for one specimen is below 
0.015 in. [0.38 mm] but not below 0.010 in. [0.25 mm], 
a retest of three additional specimens may be made. The 
lateral expansion of each of the retest specimens must equal 
or exceed 0.015 in. [0.38 mm]. 
12.2.2 Lateral expansion values shall be determined 
in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
12.2.3 The values of absorbed energy in foot-pounds 
and the fracture appearance in percentage shear shall be 
recorded for information. A record of these values shall 
be retained for a period of at least 2 years. 
13. Mechanical Tests 
13.1 Tension Test - One tension test shall be made on 
a specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension 
tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes for lots 
of more than 50 tubes. 
13.2 Flattening Test - One flattening test shall be made 
on specimens from each end of one finished tube of each 
lot but not the one used for the flare or flange test. 
13.3 Flare Test (Seamless Tubes)- One flare test shall 
be made on specimens from each end of one finished tube 
of each lot, but not the one used for the flattening test. 
13.4 Flange Test (Welded Tubes) - One flange test 
shall be made on specimens from each end of one finished 
tube of each lot, but not the one used for the flattening test. 
13.5 Reverse Flattening Test - For welded tubes, one 
reverse flattening test shall be made on a specimen from 
each 1500 ft [460 m] of finished tubing. 
13.6 Hardness Test - Brinell or Rockwell hardness 
tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes from 
each lot. 
13.7 Impact Tests - One notched-bar impact test, con­
sisting of breaking three specimens, shall be made from 
each heat represented in a heat-treatment load on specimens 
taken from the finished tube. This test shall represent only 
tubes from the same heat, which have wall thicknesses not 
exceeding by more than¼ in. [6.3 mm] the wall thicknesses 
of the tube from which the test specimens are taken. If 
heat treatment is performed in continuous or batch-type 
furnaces controlled within a 50°F [30°C] range and 
equipped with recording pyrometers which yield complete 
heat-treatment records, then one test from each heat in a 
continuous run only shall be required instead of one test 
from each heat in each heat-treatment load. 
13.8 Impact Tests (Welded Tubes) - On welded tube, 
additional impact tests of the same number as required in 
13.7 shall be made to test the weld. 
13.9 Specimens showing defects while being machined 
or prior to testing may be discarded and replacements shall 
be considered as original specimens. 
496 
14. Specimens for Impact Test 
14.1 Notched-bar impact specimens shall be of the 
simple beam, Charpy-type, in accordance with Test Meth­
ods E 23, Type A, with a V notch. Standard specimens 10 
by 10 mm in cross section shall be used unless the material 
to be tested is of insufficient thickness, in which case the 
largest obtainable subsize specimens shall be used. Charpy 
specimens of width along the notch larger than 0.394 in. 
[10 mm] or smaller than 0.099 in. [2.5 mm] are not provided 
for in this specification. 
14.2 Test specimens shall be obtained so that the longi­
tudinal axis of the specimen is parallel to the longitudinal 
axis of the tube while the axis of the notch shall be perpen­
dicular to the surface. On wall thicknesses of 1 in. [25 mm] 
or less, the specimens shall be obtained with their axial 
plane located at the midpoint; on wall thicknesses over 1 
in. [25 mm], the specimens shall be obtained with their 
axial plane located½ in. [12.5 mm] from the outer surface. 
14.3 When testing welds the specimen shall be, when­
ever diameter and thickness permits, transverse to the lon­
gitudinal axis of the tube with the notch of the specimen
