SA-480/SA-480M (ASTM A480/A480M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
including 2 in. [50.8 mm] nominal size shall be capable of 
passing the intergranular corrosion test in the as shipped 
condition. In the case of heavier plates of types other than 
304L, 304LN, 309Cb, 310Cb, 316Cb, 316L, 316LN, 316Ti, 
317L, 321, 347, 348, S31725, S31726, and S31740, the 
applicability of this test shall be a matter for negotiation 
between the seller and the purchaser. 
18.2.2 The H types are not normally subject to intergranular 
corrosion tests. However, it is permitted to specify Practice E 
of Practices A262 for 'fype 321H when intergranular corrosion 
is of concern. In this case, the purchaser shall inform the seller 
and agree upon the requirements and these requirements shall 
be so stated on the purchase order. 
18.2.3 Austenitic chromium-manganese-nickel types (201, 
202, XM-17, XM-18, XM-19, XM-29, XM-31, S20400, 
S21640, and S21800) are to be heat treated for intergranular 
corrosion resistance. When intergranular corrosion tests are 
required, they shall be as agreed upon between the seller and 
the purchaser. 
18.2.4 N08800 shall be heat treated for intergranular corro­
sion resistance. When intergranular corrosion tests are 
required, they shall be as agreed upon between the seller and 
purchaser. 
18.2.5 Corrosion tests are not normally required for the 400 
series types. Lower-carbon corrosion-resistant types (S44400, 
S44635, S44660, S44700, S44800, S44735, XM-27, and XM-
33) are heat treated for resistance to corrosion. For S44400, 
S44635, S44660, S44700, S44800, S44735, XM-27, and XM-
33, intergranular corrosion testing of Practices A763, Practice 
X, Y, or Z shall be specified as agreed upon between the seller 
and the purchaser. 
18.3 Detrimental Intermetallic Phases in Duplex Stainless 
Steels-The tests for detrimental intermetallic phases in 
wrought duplex stainless steels, Methods A, B, or C of Test 
Methods A923 or A1084, are not required unless it is specified 
on the purchase order. All duplex (austenitic-ferritic) types that 
are listed in Test Methods A923 or A1084 are expected to be 
capable of passing these tests. However, it is not necessary to 
actually run the tests unless specified on the purchase. order. 
The applicability of these tests to duplex stainless steels not 
listed in Test Methods A923 or A1084 shall be a matter for 
negotiation between the seller and the purchaser. 
19. Test Methods 
19.1 The properties enumerated in applicable specifications 
shall be determined in accordance with the following ASTM 
standards. 
19.1.1 Tension Tests-Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
19.1.2 Brinell Tests-Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
19.1.3 Rockwell Hardness-Test Methods and Definitions 
A370. 
19.1.4 Hardness Equivalents-Tables B140. 
19.1.5 Intergranular Corrosion (When Specified)-Practices 
A262, Practices A763. 
19.1.6 Permeability Test (When Required)-Test Methods 
A342/ A342M. 
19.1.7 Charpy Impact Testing (When Required)-Test 
Methods and Definitions A370. 
19.1.8 lntermetallic Phases (When Specified)-Test Meth­
ods A923 or A1084. 
20. Retests and Retreatment 
20.1 Retests are permitted in accordance with the provisions 
of Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
20.2 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws, it is permitted to discard the flawed specimen 
and substitute another specimen. 
20.2.1 If the percentage of elongation of any tension speci­
men is less than that specified and any part of the fracture is 
more than¾ in. [19.1 mm] from the center of the gauge length 
of the 2 in. [50.8 mm] specimen or is outside the middle half 
of the gauge length of an 8 in. [203.2 mm] specimen, as 
indicated by scribe marks placed on the specimen before 
testing, a retest shall be allowed. 
20.3 If a bend test specimen fails, due to conditions of 
bending more severe than required by the specification, a retest 
shall be permitted, either on a duplicate specimen or on a 
remaining portion of the failed specimen. 
20.4 If the results of any test lot are not in conformance with 
the requirements of the applicable material specification, the 
producer is permitted the option of retreating such lots. The 
material shall be accepted if the results of retests on retreated 
material are within the specified requirements. 
20.5 If any specimens selected to represent any heat fail to 
meet any of the test requirements as specified in the applicable 
material specification, it is permitted to reheat treat the material 
represented and resubmit it for testing. 
20.6 If the product analysis fails to conform to the specified 
limits, analysis shall be made on a new sample. The results of 
this retest shall be within the specified requirements.

21. Repair of Plate by Welding 
21.1 Repair of surface defects of plate, by welding, is 
permitted unless prohibited by other specifications or purchase 
order requirements. 
21.2 Defect depth shall not exceed ½ of the nominal 
thickness, and the total area shall not exceed 1 % of the plate 
surface area, unless prior approval from the purchaser is 
obtained. 
21.3 Unacceptable imperfections shall be suitably prepared 
for welding by grinding or machining. Open clean defects, 
such as pits or impressions, will not necessarily require 
preparation. 
21.4 The welding procedure and the welders or welding 
operators shall be qualified in accordance with Section IX of 
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
21.5 The welding consumables shall be suitable with the 
plate. 
21.6 After repair welding, the welded area shall be ground 
smooth and blended uniformly to the surrounding surface.
