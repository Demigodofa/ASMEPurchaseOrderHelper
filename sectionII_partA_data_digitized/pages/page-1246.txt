NOTE 1-The ten levels of severity of intergranular network structures shown are indicative of the presence of aluminum nitride precipitation in the 
primary austenitic grain boundaries.

Shown In Fig. S23.1 
NoTE 1-These ratings are based on the physical width and continuity 
of the precipitate pattern developed by the acid etchant on the primary 
austenitic grain boundaries of the cast steel. Supplementary testing is 
normally conducted to determine the final disposition of castings with 
ratings of 5 or greater.

S24.3 Should the purchaser wish to have the ferrite content 
determined by either magnetic response or metallographic 
methods, the purchaser should impose Supplementary Require­
ment Sl or S2 of Practice A800/A800M. 
S25. Heat Treatment Certification 
S25.l Heat treatment temperature and cycle times shall be 
shown on the certification report. 
S26. Alternate Tension Test Coupons and Specimen Loca­
tions for Castings 
S26. l Test coupons may be cast integrally with the castings 
or separately. Separately cast coupons shall be heat treated 
together with the castings they represent. 
S26.2 The casting thickness, T, is the maximum thickness of 
the pressure-containing wall of the casting exclusive of pad­
ding added for directional solidification, flanges, appendages, 
and sections designated by the designer as noncritical. The 
order, inquiry, and drawing shall designate what the test 
dimension, T, is for the casting. 
S26.3 One of the following shall apply: 
S26.3.l The longitudinal centerline of the test specimen 
shall be taken at least ¼ T from the T dimension surface and all 
of the gage length must· be at least 1 T from any other 
heat-treated surface, exclusive of the surface opposite the T 
dimension surface. (See Specification Al067/Al067M, Fig. 5 
(a).) For cylindrical castings, the longitudinal centerline of the 
specimens shall be taken at least ¼ T from the outside or inside 
and all of the gage length must be at least T from the 
as-heat-treated end. (See Specification Al067/Al067M, Fig. 5 
(b).) 
S26.3.2 For ferritic and martensitic castings, partial sever­
ing of test coupons prior to final heat treatment is permitted. 
S26.3.3 Where separately cast test coupons are used, the 
dimension shall not be less than 3 T by 3 T by T and each 
specimen shall meet the requirements of S26.3.l, except that
