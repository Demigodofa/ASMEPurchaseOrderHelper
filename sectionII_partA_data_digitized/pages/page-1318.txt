1.2 This specification also covers a group of supple­
mentary requirements that may be applied to the above 
specifications as indicated therein. These are provided for 
use when additional testing or inspection is desired and 
apply only when specified individually by the purchaser 
in the order. 
1.3 The requirements of the individual material speci­
fication, and this general specification shall prevail in the 
sequence named. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification. Inch-pound units are applicable for 
material ordered to Specification A 781 and SI units for 
material ordered to Specification A 781M.
