SA-748/SA-748M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Statically Cast Chilled White Iron-Gray Iron Dual Metal Rolls 
for Pressure Vessel Use 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers statically cast dual metal rolls 
with the outer layer of the roll body being chilled white iron of 
different chemical composition than the core and joumals of 
the roll which is gray cast iron. The castings are suitable for 
pressure containing parts, the design strength of which is based 
on the gray iron p011ion of the cylinder. The castings are 
suitable for service at temperatures up to 450°F [232°C]. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.3 The following safety hazards statement pertains only to 
the test method portion, 9, of this specification: This standard 
does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, if any, 
associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this 
standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices 
and detennine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior 
to use.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for material under this specification shall include 
the following information: 
3.1.1 ASTM designation and year of issue, 
3.1.2 Dimensions of dual rolls, 
3.1.3 Class of gray iron in the roll core (see 4.2), 
3.1.4 Inspection requirements, if different (see 10.1), 
3.1.5 Certification, if required (see 11.1), and 
3.1.6 Special position of marking information, if required 
(see 12.1). 
3.2 Any additional requirements not covered in this speci­
fication are subject to agreement between the manufacturer and 
purchaser. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The melting procedure shall be optional with the 
foundry. 
4.2 The chilled white iron exterior of the roll body shall be 
made to a minimum hardness of 60 Scleroscope "C". The gray 
iron portion of the roll shall conform to the applicable class of 
Specification A278/A278M, as determined by design require­
ments. The scope of this specification shall include Nos. 20, 25, 
30, 35, 150,175,200, and 250 of Specification A278/A278M. 
4.3 The casting process shall be controlled to produce a 
metallurgical bond between the chilled white iron exterior and 
gray iron interior of the roll body. 
5. Test Requirements 
5.1 Tensile Requirements-Tensile bars removed from a 
prolongation at one end of the roll journal, in accordance with 
Specification A278/A278M, shall have a tensile strength not 
less than 80 % of that specified by the applicable class of 
Specification A278/A278M. 
5.2 Thickness of Chilled White Iron: 
5.2.1 The thickness of the clear chilled white iron plus the 
mottled iron at the roll face shall not be more than 30 % of the 
total finished wall thickness. 
5.2.2 The thickness of the chilled white iron exterior of the 
roll body shall be determined by measuring the chill depth at 
the ends of the roll face. 
6. Finish 
6.1 All surfaces shall be machined or ground, or both, prior 
to the rolls being placed into service.
