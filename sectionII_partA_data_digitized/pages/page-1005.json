Manufacture \n4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and \nshall conform to the fine austenitic grain requirement of \n5. Heat Treatment \n5 .1 All plates shall be heat treated by heating to a suitable \ntemperature within the range from 1550 to 1800\u00b0F [845 to \n980\u00b0C], holding for a sufficient time to obtain uniform tem\u00ad\nperature throughout the plate thickness and then quenching, in \nwater. Subsequently the plates shall be tempered at a suitable \ntemperature to produce the specified properties, but not less \nthan 1100\u00b0F [595\u00b0C] with a minimum holding time of\u00bd h/in. \n[1.2 min/mm] of thickness, but not less than V2 h. \n5.2 When the plates are heat treated by the fabricator, it \nshall be his responsibility to apply the proper heat treatment \nand to conduct tests he deems necessary to assure that the \nspecified properties are attained. Plates thicker than 2 in. [50 \nmm] shall be stress-relieved by the manufacturer prior to \nshipment at a temperature no lower than 1100\u00b0F [595\u00b0C]. \n6. Chemical Requirements \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements \nshown in Table 1 unless otherwise modified in accordance with \nSupplementary Requirement S 17, Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized \nSteel, in Specification A20/ A20M. \n7. Mechanical Requirements \n7.1 Tension Test Requirements: \n7 .1.1 The material as represented by the tension-test speci\u00ad\nmens shall conform to the requirements shown in Table 2. \n7.1.2 For nominal plate thicknesses of\u00be in. [20 mm] and \nunder, the 1 V2-in. [40 mm] wide rectangular specimen may be \nused, and the elongation may be determined in a 2-in. [50-mm] \ngage length that include the fracture and that shows the greatest \nelongation. \n8.
