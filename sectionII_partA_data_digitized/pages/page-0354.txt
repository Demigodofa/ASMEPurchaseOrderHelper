SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the purchase order. 
Lists of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser are included 
in Specifications A 703/ A 703M and A985/ A985M. Those which are ordinarily considered suitable for 
use with this specification are given below. Others enumerated in Specifications A703/A703M and 
A985/A985M may be used with this specification upon agreement between the manufacturer and 
purchaser.

S51.5 The minimum carbon content for the casting base 
metal shall be 0.18 wt.%. The maximum carbon content shall 
be as required for the appropriate grade. 
S51.6 Welding consumables for repair welds shall be of the 
low-hydrogen type. E60:XX electrodes shall not be used. 
S51. 7 In addition to the requirements for product marking in 
the specification, an "HF-N" stamp or marking shall be 
provided on each casting to identify that the casting complies 
with this supplementary requirement. 
S52. Lower Sulfur Maximum 
S52.l When specified in the order, the maximum sulfur 
content of Grade WCA, or Grade WCB, or Grade WCC shall 
not exceed 0.030. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
Committee A0l has identified the location of selected changes to this standard since the last issue 
(A216/A216M-18) that may impact the use of this standard. (Approved Sept. 1, 2021.) 
(1) Updated Supplementary Requirements S51.4 to S51.6 to 
make base metal and weld filler metal chemistry requirements 
more clear.
