In addition to the \nSection IX qualification limits, the weld test plate thickness \nshall be as agreed upon between the casting supplier and the \npurchaser, but no less than 1.5 times the maximum weld repair \ndepth. The weld deposit thickness shall be at least 80 % of the \nmaximum repair depth. \nS52.4.1 When the thickness of the qualification coupon is \nless than or equal to 4 in. [100 mm], and the qualification \ncoupon is subjected to a post-weld solution heat treatment in \naccordance with Table 1, Charpy impact testing shall be \nperformed at one of the test temperatures listed in Table S52.2. \nTABLE S52.2 Weld Qualification Impact Testing for'Post-Weld \nSolution-Treated Coupons \nNOTE 1-It is recommended that test temperature selection be deter\u00ad\nmined based on the intended service temperature of the casting. \nTest Temperature \nOF [OC] \n-51 [-46] \n-105 (-76] \n-150 [-101] \nCharpY V-Notch Impact Requirements \nEnergy Value, ft-lbf [J], min \nvalue for two specimens Energy Value, ft-lb!

Charpy impact test locations shall be at the \nweld cap and mid-thickness of the weld deposit. Three speci\u00ad\nmens shall be removed from each of these three locations: the \nfusion line, fusion line + 2 mm, and fusion line + 5 mm. The \naverage value of the three specimens shall not be less than \nspecified in Table Table S52.2, with no more than one value \npermitted below the average minimum specified and no value \npermitted below the minimum specified for a single specimen. \nTABLE S52.3 Weld Qualification Impact Testing for As-Welded \nCoupons \nTest Temperature \n\u00b0F [\u00b0C] \n-51 [-46] \n-105 [-76] \n-150 [-101] \nCharpy V-Notch Impact Requirements \nEnergy Value, ft-lbf [J], min \nvalue for two specimens Energy Value, ft-lb!

Weld test coupons subjected \nto a post-weld solution heat treatment shall be tested at 60 \u00b0C. \nWeld test coupons not being subjected to a post-weld solution \nheat treatment shall be tested at 50 \u00b0C. Regardless of heat treat \ncondition, the acceptance criteria and test time shall be the \nsame as outlined in S52.3. \n1484 ",
