accordance with 6.1 or they shall be cooled in the mold to 
500°F at m1 average rate of not more than 100°F/h for castings 
up to 1 in. in section. For heavier sections the maximum 
cooling rate in degrees Fahrenheit per hour shall be 100 
divided by the maximum section thickness. 
6.2.2 Castings of Class Nos. 275, 300, 325, 350, 380, and 
415, which are to be used at temperatures below 230°C, may be 
heat treated in accordance with 6.1 or they shall be cooled in 
the mold to 250"C at an average rate of not more than 50°C/h 
for castings up to 25-mm in section. For heavier sections the 
maximum cooling rate in degrees Celsius per hour shall be 
1250 divided by the maximum section thickness. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.l Carbon Equivalent: 
7.1.1 Class 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 castings intended for 
service above 450°F (230°C) shall have a maximum carbon 
equivalent of 3.8 % as calculated from the equation CE = %C 
+ 0.3 (%Si + %P). The maximum phosphorus and sulfm 
contents shall be 0.25 % and 0.12 %, respectively. 
7.1.2 Class 275, 300, 325, 350, 380, and 415 castings 
intended for service above 230°C shall have a maximum 
carbon equivalent of 3.8 % as calculated from the equation CE 
= %C + 0.3 (%Si + %P). The maximum phosphorus and sulfur 
contents shall be 0.25 % and 0.12 %, respectively. 
7.2 The chemical analysis for total carbon shall be made on 
either chilled cast pencil-type specimens or thin wafers ap­
proximately ½2 in. thick cut from test coupons. Drillings shall 
not be used because of attendant loss of graphite. 
8. Tensile Requirements 
8.1 Iron used in supplying castings to this specification shall 
conform to the tensile requirements prescribed in Table 3 and 
Table 4. 
9. Test Bars 
9.1 Separately cast test bars having the dimensions shown in 
Table 1 shall be poured from the same lot as the castings

represented. The size of the test bar to be poured shall be 
selected by the purchaser using Table 5. In the event no choice 
is made, the selection will be made by the manufacturer. 
9.2 Separately cast test bars shall be heat treated in the same 
furnace together with the castings represented. 
9.3 At the option of the manufacturer, test coupons may be 
removed from the casting at a location agreed npon between 
the manufacturer and purchaser.

9.4 Castings weighing in excess of 2000 lb may be repre­
sented either by separately cast test bars (9.l) or by integrally 
cast test bars having a cooling rate closely approximating that 
of the controlling section of the casting. 
9.5 For castings weighing in excess of 10 000 lb or having 
a controlling section greater than 2 in., test bars may be 
removed from the casting or integral projections having a cross 
section no less than the controlling section. The minimum 
tensile strength requirement for tension tests performed on 
either of these test bars shall be 80 % of the specified class. 
10. Molding and Pouring Test Bars 
10.1 The test bars shall be cast in dried siliceous sand molds 
maintained at approximately room temperature. A suitable 
design for a mold is shown in Fig. 1.
