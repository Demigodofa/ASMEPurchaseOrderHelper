ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-31 
5.2 Heat Analysis - An analysis of each heat of steel 
shall be made by the bar manufacturer to determine for 
Grades A and B the percentages of carbon, manganese, 
phosphorus, and sulfur. This analysis shall be made from 
a test ingot taken during the pouring of the heat. The 
chemical composition thus determined shall be reported to 
the purchaser or his representative and shall conform to the 
requirements for heat analysis in accordance with Table 1. 
5.3 Product Analysis - An analysis may be made by 
the purchaser from finished materials representing each 
heat. The chemical composition thus determined shall con­
form to the requirements for product analysis prescribed 
in Table 1. 
5.4 Application of heats of steel to which bismuth, 
selenium, tellurium, or lead has been intentionally added 
shall not be permitted. 
5.5 Chemical analyses shall be performed in accor­
dance with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology 
A 751. 
6. Mechanical Properties 
6.1 Rivet Bend Tests: 
6.1.1 The rivet shank of Grade A steel shall stand 
being bent cold through 180° flat on itself, as shown in 
Fig. 1, without cracking on the outside of the bent portion. 
6.1.2 The rivet shank of Grade B steel shall stand 
being bent cold through 180° without cracking on the 
outside of the bent portion in accordance with Table 2. 
6.2 Rivet Flattening Tests - The rivet head shall stand 
being flattened, while hot, to a diameter 2½ times the 
diameter of the shank, as shown in Fig. 2, without cracking 
at the edges. 
6.3 Bar Tensile Properties - Bars shall conform to the 
tensile requirements in accordance with Table 3. 
6.4 Bar Bend Tests: 
6.4.1 The test specimen for Grade A steel bars shall 
stand being bent cold through 180° flat on itself without 
cracking on the outside of the bent portion. 
6.4.2 The test specimen for Grade B steel bars shall 
stand being bent cold through 180° without cracking on 
the outside of the bent portion to an inside diameter which 
shall have a relation to the diameter of the specimen in 
accordance with Table 4. 
7. Dimensions, Mass, and Permissible Variations 
7.1 Rivets: 
7.1.1 The dimensions of rivets shall conform to 
B18.l.2 for nominal diameters in. and larger and Bl8.l.1 
for nominal diameters ½_ 6 in. and less. 
7 .1.2 Snap gage measurement shall be made at the 
point of minimum diameter, but it is not required that the 
rivet shall turn completely in the gage. Measurements of 
the maximum tolerance shall be made with a ring gage, 
all rivets to slip full to the head in the gage of the required 
size for the various diameters. 
7 .2 Bars - The diameter of hot- finished rivet bars shall 
not vary from the size specified by more than the amounts 
in accordance with Table 5. 
8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
8.1 Rivets - The finished rivets shall be true to form, 
concentric, and free of injurious defects. 
8.2 Bars: 
8.2.1 Bars shall be free of visible pipe, undue segre­
gation, and injurious surface imperfections. 
8.2.2 Surface Finish- The bars shall have a commer­
cial hot-wrought finish obtained by conventional hot roll­
ing. See 4.4 for producer's descaling option. 
121 
9. Number of Tests and Retests 
9.1 Rivets - Sampling for rivet bend and rivet flattening 
tests shall be in accordance with Guide F 1470, detection 
process. 
9.2 Bars: 
9.2.1 Two tension tests shall be made from each 
heat, unless the finished material from a heat is less than 
50 tons ( 45 Mg), when one tension test will be sufficient. 
However, for material 2 in. (51 mm) and under in thickness, 
when the material from one heat differs¾ in. (9.5 mm) or 
more in thickness, one tension test shall be made from 
both the thickest and the thinnest material rolled regardless 
of the weight represented. Each test shall conform to the 
specified requirements. 
9.2.2 Retests on bars may be made in accordance 
with Specification A 29 I A 29M. 
10. Specimen Preparation 
10.1 Rivets - Rivets shall be tested in their full-size 
finished condition. 
10.2 Bars: 
10.2.1 Test specimen selection and preparation shall 
be in accordance with Specification A 29 I A 29M and Test 
Methods and Definitions A 370. 
10.2.2 Tension and bend test specimens for rivet 
bars which have been cold drawn shall be normalized 
before testing.
