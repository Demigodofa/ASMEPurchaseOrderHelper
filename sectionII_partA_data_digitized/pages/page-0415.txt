13.7 Grain Size-Grain size determinations on grades 
TP309H, TP309HCb, TP310H and TP310HCb shall be made 
on the same number of tubes as prescribed for the flattening 
test. 
13.8 Heavily cold worked tubes (HCW) shall be capable of 
passing the -weld decay test listed in Supplementary S7 with a 
weld metal to base metal loss ratio of 0.90 to 1.10. The test is 
not required unless S7 is specified in the purchase order. 
13.9 Lot Definitions: 
13.9.1 For flattening and flange requirements, the term lot 
applies to all tubes prior to cutting of the same nominal size 
and wall thickness which are produced from the same heat of 
steel. When final heat treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot 
shall include only those tubes of the same size and from the 
same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace charge. 
When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, the 
number of tubes of the same size and from the same heat in a 
lot shall be determined from the size of the tubes as prescribed 
in Table 4. 
13.9.2 For tension and hardness test requirements, the term 
lot applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal 
diameter and wall thickness which are produced from the same 
heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a batch-type 
furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the same size 
and the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace 
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous 
furnace, a lot shall include all tubes of the same size and heat, 
annealed in the same furnace at the same temperature, time at 
heat, and furnace speed. 
14. Permissible Variations in Dimensions 
14.1 Dimensional tolerances other than wall thickness tol­
erances shall be in accordance with Specification A1016/ 
TABLE 4 Number of Tubes in a Lot Heat Treated by the 
Continuous Process 
Size of Tube 
2 in. [50.8 mm] and over in outside 
diameter and 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] and over 
in wall thickness 
Less than 2 in. [50.8 mm] but over 1 in. 
[25.4 mm] in outside diameter or over 1 in. 
[25.4 mm] in outside diameter and under 
0.200 In. [5.1 mm] in wall thickness 
1 In. [25.4 mm] or less in outside diameter 
Size of Lot 
not more than 50 tubes 
not more than 75 tubes 
not more than 125 
tubes 
A1016M. Wall thickness tolerances shall be ±10 % ofnominal 
wall for all tubing sizes. 
14.2 The wall thickness of the weld shall not exceed the 
wall thickness measured 90° from the weld by more than 6 % 
of the specified wall thickness or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], which­
ever is greater. 
14.2.1 Requirements of 14.2 are not applicable when any of 
the following apply: 
14.2.1.1 When the specified wall thickness exceeds 12 % of 
the specified outside diameter; 
14.2.1.2 When the specified wall thickness exceeds 0.165 
in. [4.2 mm]; 
14.2.1.3 When the specified OD exceeds 3 in. [76.2 mm]; or 
14.2.1.4 When the specified minimum yield strength given 
in Table 3 for the specified grade is 35 ksi [240 MPa] or greater. 
15. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
15.1 Finished tubes shall have smooth ends free of burrs and 
shall not deviate from straightness by more than 0.030 in. [0.8 
mm] in 3 ft [900 mm] of length. 
16. Surface Condition 
16.1 The tubes, after final heat treatment, shall be chemi­
cally descaled or pickled free of scale. When bright annealing 
is used, pickling or chemical descaling is not necessary. 
17. Forming Operations 
17 .1 Tubes when inserted in the boiler shall stand expanding 
and beading without showing cracks or flaws. All tubes, when 
properly manipulated, shall be able to stand expanding and 
beading without showing cracks and flaws, and also shall stand 
all forging, welding, and bending operations necessary for 
application without developing defects. 
18. Product Marking 
18.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
Al016/Al016M, the marking for Grades TP304H, TP309H, 
TP309HCb, TP310H, TP310HCb, TP316H, TP321H, TP347H, 
TP348H, N08810, and N08811 shall also include the heat 
number and the heat-treatment lot identification.
