The date of publication of the European standards considered in this table is the year of \napproval of the standard by CEN. This date appears in the body of the standard on the page starting with EN; dates appearing \non the front page of an XX EN standard ( e.g., XX= BS or NF or DIN) correspond only to the date of adoption by each member country. \nNOTES: \n(1) This refers to the edition of the source standard currently adopted by BPV II. The source standards for ASME material speci\u00ad\nfications listed in this table are ones from standards organizations other than ASTM International. \n(2) This refers to differences between the ASME material specification and the source standard. \n(3) This refers to acceptable editions of the corresponding non-ASTM specifications. Ellipses in this column indicate that there are \nnot any other acceptable editions. \n( 4) BPVC II Committee has taken the position that a reapproval is technically and substantively identical to the base edition. There\u00ad\nfore, for the purposes of ASME construction, a reapproval shall be considered acceptable for use, even if the edition is beyond \nthe range listed in this column, provided that its base edition is within range. \n1621 ",
