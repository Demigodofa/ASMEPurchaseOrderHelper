SPECIFICATION FOR FERRITIC DUCTILE IRON 
PRESSURE-RETAINING CASTINGS FOR USE AT 
ELEVATED TEMPERA TURES 
SA-395/SA-395M 
~ 
INTERNATIONAL 
Standards Worldwide 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 395/ A 395M-99(2018).] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers ductile iron castings for 
pressure-retaining parts for use at elevated temperatures. 
Castings of all grades are suitable for use up to 450°F. For 
temperatures above 450°F and up to 650°F, only Grade 
60-40-18 castings are suitable (Note 1). 
1.2 Valves, flanges, pipe fittings, pumps, and other 
piping components are generally manufactured in advance 
and supplied from stock by the manufacturer, jobber, or 
dealer. 
1.3 For supplemental casting requirements, Specifica­
tion A 834 may be utilized. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
to the specification. 
NOTE I - For service other than as specified in this section, reference 
should be made to Specification A 536 for Ductile Iron Castings.
