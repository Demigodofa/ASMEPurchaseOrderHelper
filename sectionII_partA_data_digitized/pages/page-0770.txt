SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall be applied only when specified by 
the purchaser in the inquiry, contract, or order; in which event the specified tests shall be made before 
shipment of the product. 
Sl. Non-Destructive Examination 
S 1.1 NDE is required following all machining and thread­
ing. The acceptance criteria of 12.1 shall apply. 
S2. Stress Rupture Testing-Grade B4B 
S2.1 Stress rupture testing shall be conducted at 1200 °F 
[650 °C] and 26 000 psi [180 MPa] using a combination test 
bar in accordance with Test Methods E292. Rupture shall occur 
in the smooth section of each test specimen. The test may be 
720 
discontinued after 25 h provided the certification so notes. · 
Stress rupture testing is not required on bars less than ½ in. 
[12.7 mm] in diameter or thickness. 
S3. Grain Size-Grades B4B and B4C 
S3.l The average grain size shall be 4 or finer. The 
maximum size of individual grains, distributed at random, shall 
be a 2. When the average grain size is 5 or finer, only the 
average size need be reported. Grain size determination shall 
be performed in accordance with Test Methods El12.
