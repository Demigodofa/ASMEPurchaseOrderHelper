The \nmanufacturer, secondary processors, and distributors shall \nidentify and maintain the integrity of each production lot of \nbolts from raw-material selection through all processing op\u00ad\nerations and treatments to final packing and shipment. Each lot \nshall be assigned its own lot-identification number, each lot \nshall be tested, and the inspection test reports for each lot shall \nbe retained. \n9.4 Lot Definition-A lot shall be a quantity of uniquely \nidentified heavy hex structural bolts of the same nominal size \nand length produced consecutively at the initial operation from \na single mill heat of material and processed at one time, by the \nsame process, in the same manner so that statistical sampling is \nvalid. The identity of the lot and lot integrity shall be \nmaintained throughout all subsequent operations and packag\u00ad\ning. \n9.5 Number of Tests-The minimum number of tests from \neach lot for the tests specified below shall be as follows: \nTests \nHardness, tensile \nstrength, proof load, \nand rotational capacity \nCoating weight/ \nthickness \nSurface discontinuities \nDimensions and \nthread fit \nNumber of Tests \nin Accordance With \nPractice F1470 \nThe referenced coating \nspecificationA \nSpecification F788/F788M \nASME B18.2.6 \nA Practice F1470 applies if the coating specification does not specify a testing \nfrequency. \n10. Test Methods \n10.1 Tensile, Proof Load, and Hardness: \n10.1.1 Tensile, proof load, and hardness tests shall be \nconducted in accordance with Test Methods F606. \n10.1.2 Tensile strength shall be determined using the Wedge \nor Axial Tension Testing Method of Full Size Product Method \nor the Machined Test Specimens Method depending on size \nand nominal length as specified in 6.2.1-6.2.2. Fracture on \nfull-size tests shall be in the body or threads of the bolt without \na fracture at the junction of the head and body. \n10.1.3 Proof load shall be determined using Method 1, \nLength Measurement, or Method 2, Yield Strength, at the \noption of the manufacturer. \n10.2 Rotational Capacity-The zinc-coated bolt shall be \nplaced in a steel joint or tension measuring device and \nassembled with a zinc-coated washer and a zinc-coated and \nlubricated nut with which the bolt is intended to be used (see \nNote 4). The nut shall have been provided with the lubricant \ndescribed in the last paragraph of the Manufacturing Processes \nsection of Specification A563. The joint shall be one or more \nflat structural steel plates or fixture stack up with a total \nthickness, including the washer, such that 3 to 5 full threads of \nthe bolt are located between the bearing surfaces of the bolt \nhead and nut. The hole in the joint shall have the same nominal \ndiameter as the hole in the washer. The initial tightening of the \nnut shall produce a load in the bolt not less than 10 % of the \nspecified proof load. After initial tightening, the nut position \nshall be marked relative to the bolt, and the rotation shown in \nTable 6 shall be applied. During rotation, the bolt head shall be \nrestrained from turning. After the tightening rotation has been \napplied, the assembly shall be taken apart and examined for \ncompliance with 6.3.3. \n479 \nNoTE 4-Rotational capacity tests shall apply only to matched assem\u00ad\nbly lots that contain one A325 bolt, one A563 lubricated nut, and one F436 \nwasher that have been zinc coated in accordance with either Specifications \nF2329 or B695. Both the bolt and nut components of the matched \nassembly shall be zinc coated using the same process. \n11. Inspection \n11.1 If the inspection described in 11.2 is required by the \npurchaser, it shall be specified in the inquiry and contract or \norder. \n11.2 The purchaser's representative shall have free entry to \nall parts of the manufacturer's works, or supplier's place of \nbusiness, that concern the manufacture or supply of the \nmaterial ordered. The manufacturer or supplier shall afford the \npurchaser's representative all reasonable facilities to satisfy \nhim that the material is being furnished in accordance with this \nspecification. All tests and inspections required by the specifi\u00ad\ncation that are requested by the purchaser's representative shall \nbe made before shipment, and shall be conducted as not to ",
