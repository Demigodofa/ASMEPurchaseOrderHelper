SA-266/SA-266M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Carbon Steel Forgings for Pressure Vessel Components 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers four grades of carbon steel 
forgings for boilers, pressure vessels, and associated equip­
ment. 
NoTE 1-Designations have been changed as follows: 
Current 
Grade 1 
Grade 2 
Grade 3 
Grade 4 
Formerly 
Class 1 
Class 2 
Class 3 
Class 4 
1.2 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when 
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply 
only when specified individually by the purchaser in the order. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other, and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined. 
1.4 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch­
pound units. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Information and General Requirements 
3.1 In addition to the ordering information required by 
Specification A 788/ A 788M, the purchaser shall include with 
the inquiry and order a detailed drawing, sketch, or written 
description of the forging. 
3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out­
lines additional ordering information, manufacturing 
requirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, 
marking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi­
tional supplementary requirements. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, the 
requirements of this specification shall prevail. 
3.4 For hubbed flat heads and tube sheets ordered for ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code application, Supplementary 
Requirement S12 of Specification A788/A788M shall be 
specified in addition to Supplementary Requirement S8 of this 
specification. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel shall be made in accordance with the Melting 
Process Section of Specification A788/A788M. A sufficient
