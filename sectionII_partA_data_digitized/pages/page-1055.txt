ANSI B 1.1 Unified Screw Threads 
ANSI Bl8.2.2 Square and Hex Nuts 
3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for nuts under this specification shall include 
the following: 
3.1.1 Quantity (number of nuts), 
3.1.2 Nominal size and thread series of nuts, 
3.1.3 Style of nut (for example, heavy hex), 
3.1.4 Grade of nut, 
3.1.5 Zinc Coating - Specify the zinc-coating pro­
cess required, for example, hot-dip, mechanically depos­
ited, or no preference (see 4.7), 
3.1.6 Other Finishes - Specify other protective fin­
ish if required, 
3.1.7 ASTM designation and year of issue, and 
3.1.8 Supplementary or special requirements. 
NOTE 3 - An example of an ordering description follows: 1000 1/g-9 
heavy hex nuts, Grade DH, hot-dip zinc-coated, and lubricated, ASTM 
A 563-XX. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Steel for nuts shall be made by the open-hearth, 
basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace process except that steel 
for Grades 0, A, and B nuts may be made by the acid­
bessemer process. 
4.2 Nuts may be made cold or hot by forrning, pressing, 
or punching or may be machined from bar stock. 
4.3 Grades DH and DH3 nuts shall be heat treated by 
quenching in a liquid medium from a temperature above 
llie trarisfonnationtemperaturtTillld--tempering-at a-tempera~ 
ture of at least 800°F. 
4.4 Grades C and D nuts made of steel having carbon 
content not exceeding 0.20%, phosphorus not exceeding 
0.04%, and sulfur not exceeding 0.05% by heat analysis 
may be heat treated by quenching in a liquid medium from 
a temperature above the transformation temperature and 
need not be tempered. When this heat treatment is used, 
there shall be particular attention to the requirements in 
6.1.1. 
4.5 Grades C, C3, and D nuts made of any steel permit­
ted for these grades may be heat treated by quenching in 
a liquid medium from a temperature above the transforma­
tion temperature and tempering at a temperature of at least 
800°F. 
4.6 Threads shall be formed by tapping or machining. 
4.7 Zinc Coatings, Hot-Dip and Mechanically 
Deposited: 
4.7.1 When zinc-coated fasteners are required, the 
purchaser shall specify the zinc coating process, for exam­
ple, hot-dip, mechanically deposited, or no preference. 
4.7.2 When hot-dip is specified, the fasteners shall 
be zinc-coated by the hot-dip process in accordance with 
the requirements of Specification F 2329. 
4.7.3 When mechanically deposited is specified, the 
fasteners shall be zinc coated by the mechanical deposition 
process in accordance with the requirements of Class 55 
of Specification B 695. 
4.7.4 When no preference is specified, the supplier 
may furnish either a hot-dip zinc coating in accordance 
with Specification F 2329, or a mechanically deposited zinc 
coating in accordance with Specification B 695, Class 55. 
Threaded components (bolts and nuts) shall be coated by 
the same zinc-coating process and the supplier's option is 
limited to one process per item with no mixed processes 
in a lot. 
4.7.5 Hot-dip zinc-coated nuts shall be tapped after 
zinc coating. 
4.7.6 Mechanically deposited zinc-coated nuts for 
assembly with mechanically deposited zinc-coated bolts 
shall be tapped oversize prior to zinc coating and need not 
be retapped afterwards. 
4.8 Lubricant: 
4.8.1 Hot-dip and mechanically deposited zinc­
coated Grade DH nuts shall be provided with an additional 
lubricant which shall be clean and dry to the touch (see 
Supplementary Requirement S 1 to specify lubrication 
requirements for plain finish nuts). 
4.8.2 See Supplementary Requirement S2 for option 
to specify a dye in the lubricant. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Grades 0, A, B, C, D, and DH shall conform to 
the chemical composition specified in Table 1. 
955 
5.2 Grades C3 and DH3 shall conform to the chemical 
composition specified in Table 2. See Guide G 101 for 
methods of estimating the atmospheric corrosion resistance 
of low alloy steels. 
5.3 Resulfurized or rephosphorized steel, or both, are 
not subject to rejection based on product analysis for sulfur 
or phosphorus. 
5.4 Application of heats of steel to which bismuth, 
selenium, tellurium, or lead has been intentionally added 
shall not be permitted for Grades D, DH, and DH3.
