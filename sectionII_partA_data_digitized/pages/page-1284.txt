SA-739 ASME BPVC.Ii.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Steel Bars, Alloy, Hot-Wrought, for Elevated Temperature or 
Pressure-Containing Parts, or Both 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers hot-wrought, ferritic alloy 
steel bars for elevated temperature or pressure-containing parts 
suitable for fusion welding or both. 
1.2 The bars are furnished in the following grades: 
Grade B 11: 1.25 % chromium, 0.55 % molybdenum 
Grade B 22: 2.25 % chromium, 1.00 % molybdenum 
1.3 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as standard. The values given in. parentheses are mathematical 
.conversions to SI units that are provided for information only 
and are not considered standard.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for material under this specification should 
include the following information: 
3.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), 
3.1.2 Name of material (ferritic alloy steel bars), 
3.1.3 Condition (hot wrought, normalized and tempered, 
machine straightened and descaled), 
3.1.4 Dimensions (cross-sectional shape, size, and length), 
3.1.5 ASTM designation and date of issue, 
3.1.6 Grade (Table 1), 
3.1.7 Additions to the specification, and 
3.1.8 End use. 
Nom 1-A typical description is as follows: 10 000 lb, Fenitic Alloy 
Steel Bars, Hot Wrought Normalized and Tempered, and Descaled, 
1.000-in. diameter by IO ft, ASTM A739 dated_, Grade Bll, Special 
Straightened, Special Machined Fittings. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Melting Practice-The steel shall be made by one or 
more of the following primary processes: open-hearth, basic­
oxygen, or electric-furnace. The primary melting may incor­
porate separate degassing or refining and may be followed by 
secondary melting using electroslag remelting or vacuum arc 
remelting. Where secondary melting is employed, the heat 
shall be defined as all of the ingots remelted from a single 
primary heat. 
4.2 Condition-Unless otherwise specified, bars shall be hot 
wrought, heat treated, and descaled. 
4.3 Heat Treatment: 
4.3.1 The bars shall be normalized and tempered. 
4.3.2 Austenitizing temperature shall be within the range 
from 1700 to 1800°F (927 to 982°C). 
4.3.3 Cooling from the austenitizing temperature may be 
accomplished by cooling in still air or moving air, at the 
producer's option. When permitted by the purchaser, cooling 
from the austenitizing temperature may be accelerated by spray 
or liquid quenching. 
4.3.4 The minimum tempering temperature shall be 1200°F 
(649°C) for Grade Bll and 1250°F (677°C) for Grade B22. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 The heat analysis shall conform to the limits for chemi­
cal composition specified in Table 1 for the grade ordered. 
6. Mechanical Properties 
6.1 Tensile Requirements-The bars as represented by the 
test specimens shall conform to the tensile requirements 
specified in Table 2. 
6.2 Specimens-Tension test specimens shall be taken lon­
gitudinally and machined from the locations specified in Test 
Methods and Definitions A370.
