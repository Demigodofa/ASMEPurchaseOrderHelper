TABLE S27.2 Permissible Variations from Flatness for Carbon Steel Plates As-Rolled or Normalized Ordered to Restrictive Flatness 
NoTE I-Flatness Variations for Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and variation in flatness along the length shall not 
exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 3700 mm in length, or in any 3700 mm of longer plates. 
Norn 2-Flatness Variations for Width-The flatness variation across the width shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width. 
Norn 3-When the longer dimension is under 900 mm, the variation in flatness along the length and across the width shall not exceed 6 mm in each 
direction. When the longer dimension is from 900 to 1800 mm, inclusive, the permissible flatness variation shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount 
for the specified width, but in no case less than 6 mm. 
Norn 4--The variations given in this table apply to plates that have a minimum specified tensile strength not over 415 MPa or comparable chemistry 
or hardness. For plates specified to a higher minimum tensile strength or comparable chemistry or hardness, the permissible variations are 1 ½ times the 
amounts shown in the table below. 
Norn 5-This table and these notes cover the flatness variations of circular and sketch plates based on the maximum dimensions of those plates. 
Nom 6-Waviness tolerances for rectangular plates, universal mill plates, and circular and sketch plates do not apply. 
Norn 7-A "Z" indicates that there is no published restricted value for the size. 
Norn 8-Plates shall be in horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured.

TABLE S27.3 Permissible Variations from Flatness for High-Strength Low-Alloy Steel Plates As-Rolled or Normalized Ordered to 
Restrictive Flatness 
Norn I-Flatness Variations for Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and variation in flatness along the length shall not 
exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 12 ft in length, or in any 12 ft of longer plates. 
Norn 2-Flatness Variations for Width-The flatness variation across the width shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width. 
Norn 3-When the longer dimension is under 36 in., the variation in flatness along the length and across the width shall not exceed 3 /s in. in each 
direction. When the larger dimension is from 36 to 72 in., inclusive, the permissible flatness variation shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount for 
the specified width but in no case less than 3/s in. 
Norn 4-This table and these notes cover the flatness variations of circular and sketch plates based on the maximum dimensions of those plates. 
Norn 5-Waviness tolerances for rectangular plates, universal mill plates, and circular and sketch plates do not apply. 
Norn 6-A "Z" indicates that there is no published restricted value for the size. 
Norn 7-Plates shall be in h01izontal position on a flat smface when flatness is measured.
