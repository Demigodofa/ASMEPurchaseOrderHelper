pads that are heated for forming shall be heat treated after 
forming in accordance with 5 .2. 
5.2 Heat Treatment Procedure: 
5.2.1 First Normalizing Treatment-Heat the plate to a 
uniform temperature of 1650 ± 25°F [900 ± 15°C], hold at 
that temperature for a minimum of 1 h/in. [2.4 min/mm] of 
thickness, but in no case less than 15 min, and cool in air. 
5.2.2 Second Normalizing Treatment-Reheat the plate to a 
uniform temperature of 1450 ± 25°F [790 ± 15°C], hold at 
that temperature for a minimum of 1 h/in. [2.4 min/mm] of 
thickness, but in no case less than 15 min, and cool in air. 
5.2.3 Tempering Treatment-Reheat the plate to a unifmm 
temperature within the range from 1050 to 1125°F [565 to 
605°C], hold within that temperature range for a minimum of 
1 h/in. [2.4 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 15 
min, and cool in air or water quench at a rate not less than 
300°F/h [165°C/h]. 
5.2.4 If hot forming is performed after heating to a tempera­
ture within the range from 1650 to 1750°F [900 to.955°C] the 
first normalizing treatment (5.2.1) may be omitted. 
5.2.5 When the plates are heat treated by the fabricator, it 
shall be the fabricator's responsibility to apply the proper heat 
treatment and to conduct tests it deems necessary to ensure that 
the specified properties are attained. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical composition 
requirements shown in Table 1 unless otherwise modified in 
accordance with Supplementary Requirement S 17, Vacuum 
Carbon-Deoxidized Steel, in Specification A20/A20M. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7 .1 Tension Test Requirements-The material as represented 
by the tension-test specimens shall conform to the require­
ments specified in Table 2. 
7.1.1 Upon agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer, yield strength may be determined by the exten­
sion under load method, using 0.005 in.fin. [0.005 mm/mm] 
total extension. 
7.1.2 For nominal plate thicknesses of¾ in. [20 mm] and 
under, the 1 ½-in. [40-rnrn] wide rectangular specimen may be 
used for the tension test and the elongation may be determined 
in a 2-in. [50-mm] gage length that includes the fracture and 
shows the greatest elongation. 
7 .1.3 One tension test shall be taken from each plate as heat 
treated. 
7.2 Impact Test Requirements: 
555 
7 .2.1 Charpy V-notch impact tests shall be made in accor­
dance with Specification A20/ A20M. 
7.2.2 The longitudinal axis of the test specimens shall be 
transverse to the final rolling direction of the plate. 
7.2.3 Unless otherwise agreed, tests shall be conducted at 
-320°F [-195°C]. 
7.2.4 Each test specimen shall have a lateral expansion 
opposite the notch of not less than 0.015 in. [0.381 mm]. 
8. Finish 
8.1 Because retained scale may mask surface imperfections, 
as well as mar the plate surface, plates shall be descaled by the 
producer after heat treatment. In the case of material to be 
heat-treated by the purchaser, the plates shall be descaled by 
the producer prior to shipment.
