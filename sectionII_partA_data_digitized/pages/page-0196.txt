produce a signal greater than the acceptance limit signal given 
in Table 3 shall be considered a defect unless the pipe 
manufacturer can demonstrate that the imperfection does not 
reduce the effective wall thickness beyond 12.5 % of the 
specified wall thickness. 
9.2 Type S Pipe-As an alternative to the hydrostatic test at 
the option of the manufacturer or if specified in the purchase 
order, the full body of each seamless pipe shall be tested with 
a nondestructive electric test in accordance with Practice E213, 
E309, or E570. In such cases, each length so furnished shall 
include the mandatory marking of the letters "NDE." Except as 
allowed by 9.2.6.2, it is the intent of this nondestructive electric 
test to reject pipe with imperfections that produce test signals 
equal to or greater than those produced by the applicable 
calibration standards. 
9.2.1 If the nondestructive electric test has been performed, 
the lengths shall be marked with the letters "NDE." The 
certification, if required, shall state Nondestructive Electric 
Tested and shall indicate which of the tests was applied. Also, 
the letters NDE shall be appended to the product specification 
number and grade shown on the certification. 
9 .2.2 The following information is intended to facilitate the 
use of this specification: 
9.2.2.1 The calibration standards defined in 9.2.3 through 
9.2.5 are convenient standards for calibration of nondestructive 
testing equipment. The dimensions of such standards are not to 
be construed as the minimum sizes of imperfections detectable 
by such equipment. 
9.2.2.2 The ultrasonic testing referred to in this specification 
is capable of detecting the presence and location of significant 
longitudinally or circumferentially oriented imperfections; 
however, different techniques need to be employed for the 
detection of differently oriented imperfections. Ultrasonic test­
ing is not necessarily capable of detecting short, deep imper­
fections. 
9.2.2.3 The eddy current examination referenced in this 
specification has the capability of detecting significant 
discontinuities, especially of the short abrupt type. 
9.2.2.4 The flux leakage examination referred to in this 
specification is capable of detecting the presence and location 
of significant longitudinally or transversely oriented disconti­
nuities. The provisions of this specification only require 
longitudinal calibration for flux leakage. Different techniques 
need to be employed for the detection of differently oriented 
imperfections. 
9.2.2.5 The hydrostatic test referred to in 8.2 has the 
capability of finding imperfections of a size permitting the test 
fluid to leak through the tube wall and may be either visually 
seen or detected by a loss of pressure. Hydrostatic testing is not 
necessarily capable of detecting very tight through-the-wall 
imperfections or imperfections that extend an appreciable 
distance into the wall without complete penetration. 
144 
9.2.2.6 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of imperfections that are 
capable of being detected in the specific application of these 
examinations is directed to discuss this with the manufacturer 
of the tubular product. 
9.23 For ultrasonic testing, the calibration reference 
notches shall be at the option of the manufacturer, and shall be 
any one of the three common notch shapes shown in Practice 
E213. The depth of notch shall not exceed 12.5 % of the 
specified wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], 
whichever is the greater.
