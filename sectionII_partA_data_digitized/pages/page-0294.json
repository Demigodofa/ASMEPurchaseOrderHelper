The minimum stress\u00ad\nrelief temperature shall be within not more than 100 \u00b0F [55 \u00b0C] \nbelow the tempering temperature. Tests for mechanical prop\u00ad\nerties shall be performed after stress relieving. \n6.1.4 B6 and B6X shall be held at the tempering tempera\u00ad\nture for a minimum time of 1 h. B6X bolting material may be \nfurnished in the as-rolled-and-tempered condition. Cold works \ning after heat treatment is permitted for B6X material provided \nthe final hardness meets the requirements of Tables 2 and\u00b7 3. \n6.1.5 B7 and B7M shall be heat treated by quenching in a \nliquid medium and tempering. For B7M bolting components, \nsuch as bolts, studs, or screws, the final heat treatment, which \nmay be the tempering operation if conducted at 1150 \u00b0F [620 \n0 C] minimum, shall be done after all machining and forming \noperations, including thread rolling and any type of cutting. \nSurface preparation for hardness testing, nondestructive \nevaluation, or ultrasonic bolt tensioning is permitted. \n6.1.5.1 Unless otherwise specified, bolting material for \nGrade B7 may be heat treated by the Furnace, the Induction or \nthe Electrical Resistance method. \nNorn 4--Stress-relaxation properties may vary from heat lot to heat lot \nor these properties may vary from one heat-treating method to another. \nThe purchaser may specify Supplementary Requirement S8, when stress\u00ad\nrelaxation testing is desired. \n6.1.6 Bolting material Grade B16 shall be heated to a \ntemperature range from 1700 to 1750 \u00b0F [925 to 955 \u00b0C] and \noil quenched. The minimum tempering temperature shall be as \nspecified in Tables 2 and 3. \n6.2 Austenitic Stainless Steels: \n6.2.1 All austenitic stainless steels shall receive a carbide \nsolution treatment (see 6.2.2 - 6.2.5 for specific requirements \nfor each class). Classes 1, lB, IC (Grades B8R and B8S only), \n2, 2B, and 2C can apply to bar, wire, and finished bolting \ncomponents. Class lA (all grades) and Class IC (grades B8RA \nand B8SA only) can apply to finished bolting components. \nClass ID applies only to bar and wire and finished bolting \ncomponents that are machined directly from Class ID bar or \nwire without any subsequent hot or cold working. \n6.2.2 Classes I and JB, and Class JC Grades B8R and \nBBS-After rolling of the bar, forging, or heading, whether \ndone hot or cold, bolting material shall be heated from ambient \ntemperature and held a sufficient time at a temperature at which \nthe chromium carbide will go into solution and then shall be \ncooled at a rate sufficient to prevent the precipitation of the \ncarbide. \n6.2.3 Class JD-Rolled or forged Grades B8, B8M, B8P, \nB8LN, B8MLN, B8CLNCuB, B8N, B8MN, B8R, and B8S bar \nshall be cooled rapidly immediately following hot working \nwhile the temperature is above 1750 \u00b0F [955 \u00b0C] so that grain \nboundary carbides remain in solution. Class ID shall be \nrestricted to applications at temperatures less than 850 \u00b0F [455 \noq, \n6.2.4 Class IA and Class IC Grades B8RA and BBSA\u00ad\nFinished bolting components shall be carbide solution treated \nafter all rolling, forging, heading, and threading operations are \ncomplete. This designation does not apply to starting material \nsuch as bar. Components shall be heated from ambient tem\u00ad\nperature and held a sufficient time at a temperature at which the \nchromium carbide will go into solution and then shall be \ncooled at a rate sufficient to prevent the precipitation of the \ncarbide. \n6.2.5 Classes 2, 2B, and 2C-Bolting material shall be \ncarbide solution treated by heating from ambient temperature \nand holding a sufficient time at a temperature at which the \nchromium carbide will go into solution and then cooling at a \nrate sufficient to prevent the precipitation of the carbide. \nFollowing this treatment the bolting material shall then be \nstrain hardened to achieve the required properties. \nNorn 5-Heat treatment follqwing operations performed on a limited \nportion of the product, such as heading, may result in non-uniform grain \nsize and mechanical properties through the section affected. \n242 \n6.2.6 If a scale-free bright finish is required; this shall be \nspecified in the purchase order. \n7. Chemical Composition \n7 .1 Each alloy shall conform to the chemical composition \nrequirements prescribed in Table 1. \n8. Heat Analysis \n8.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the \nmanufacturer to determine the percentages of the elements \nspecified in Section 7. The chemical composition thus deter\u00ad\nmined shall be reported to the purchaser or the purchaser's \nrepresentative, and shall conform to the requirements specified \nin Section 7. Should the purchaser deem it necessary\u00b7 to have \nthe transition zone of two heats sequentially cast discarded, the \npurchaser shall invoke Supplementary Requirement S3 of \nSpecification A 788/ A 788M. \n9. Mechanical Properties \n9.1 Tensile Properties: \n9.1.1 Requirements-Bolting material as represented by the \ntension specimens shall conform to the requirements pre\u00ad\nscribed in Tables 2 and 3 at room temperature after heat \ntreatment. Stainless strain hardened bolting components (Class \n2, 2B, and 2C) shall be tested full size after strain hardening to \ndetermine tensile strength and yield strength and shall conform \nto the requirements prescribed in Tables 2 and 3. In cases \nwhere tensile testing equipment of sufficient capacity is not \navailable, stainless strain hardened bolting components greater \nthan 1.500 in. diameter may be tested using machined speci\u00ad\nmen. Should the results of full size tests conflict with results of \ntension specimen tests, full size test results shall prevail. \n9.1.2 Full Size Bolting Components, Wedge Tensile \nTesting-When applicable, see 12.1.3, headed components \nshall be wedge tested full size. The minimum full size load \napplied (lbf or kN) for individual sizes shall be as follows: \nW=T,XA, ( 1) ",
