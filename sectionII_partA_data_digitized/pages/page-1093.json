[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the \nanvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 \nin. [2.55 mm]. Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness \nmeasurements. \nNoTE 3-This table was constructed by multiplying the values in the \nstandard table by 0.75 and rounding to 2 decimal places using standard \nASTM practice. \nNoTE 4--The thickness of material <50 mm wide shall be measured at \nmid-width. \nSpecified Width, mm \nTo 600, incl \nOver 600 to 1200, incl \nOver 1200 to 1500, incl \nOver 1500 to 1800, incl \nOver 1800 to 2000, incl \nOver2000 \nSpecified Ordered Thickness, mmA \nThrough Over 2.0 to Over 2.5 4.5 to \n2.0 2.5, incl to 6.0, excl \n4.5, excl \nThickness Tolerances Over, mm, No Tolerance Un\u00ad\nder 8 \n0.22 0.26 0.30 0.30 \n0.26 0.30 0.34 0.38 \n0.26 0.30 0.38 0.38 \n0.30 0.34 0.41 0.42 \n0.30 0.34 0.45 0.45 \nC 0.38 0.45 0.45\u00b0 \nA The specified thickness range captions apply independent of whether the \nordered thickness is stated as a nominal or minimum. \n8 The tolerances provided in the table are based on minimum thickness (tolerance \nover, not tolerance under).
