It is also obtained by measuring \nthe difference between the diagonals of the cut length. The out-of-square \ndeviation is one half of that difference. The tolerance for all thicknesses and all \nsizes is 1.0 mm/100 mm of width or fraction thereof. \nTABLE A1.9 Restricted Squareness Tolerances of Hot-Rolled \n(Including Pickled) and Cold-Rolled Sheet (All Designations) \n(Cut Lengths) \nWhen cut lengths are specified restricted squareness, the width and the length \nare not less than the dimensions specified. The individual tolerance for over\u00ad\nwidth, over-length, camber, or out-of-square should not exceed 1.6 mm up to \nand Including 1200 mm in width and up to and including 3000 mm in length. \nFor cut lengths wider or longer, the applicable tolerance is 3.2 mm.
