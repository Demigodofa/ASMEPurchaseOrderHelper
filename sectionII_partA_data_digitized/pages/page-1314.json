LAMELLAR TEARING ADJACENT TO WELDS \nXU Introduction \nXl.1.1 Lamellar tearing is a particular type of cracking that \noccurs under the weld of a steel plate weldment. It is generally \ncaused by strain induced in the thickness direction resulting \nfrom shrinkage of the weld deposit and by the restraint \nimposed by the components that comprise the weldment. High \nrestraint increases the possibility of lamellar tearing. However, \nlamellar tearing is not solely confined to highly restrained \nweldments. Lamellar tearing may also result from loads on the \nplate surface. \nXl.2 Characteristics of Lamellar Tearing \nXl.2.1 Lamellar tearing normally occurs in susceptible \nmaterial underneath the weld, in a direction generally parallel \n1248 ",
