When the \nfinal heat treatment is in a continuous furnace or when the \nheat-treated condition is obtained directly by quenching after \nhot forming, the number of tubes of the same size and from the \nsame heat in a lot shall be determined from the size of the tubes \nas prescribed in Table 7. \n15.2 For tensile and hardness test requirements, the term lot \napplies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same size (see 4.1.7) \nthat are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat \ntreatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only \nthose tubes of the same size and the same heat that are heat \ntreated in the same furnace charge. When the final heat \ntreatment is in a continuous furnace, or when the heat-treated \ncondition is obtained directly by quenching after hot forming, \na lot shall include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat \ntreated in the same furnace at the same temperature, time at \nheat, and furnace speed; or all tubes of the same size and heat, \nhot formed and quenched in the same production run, except as \nprescribed in 9.1.3. \nSize of Lot \nnot more than 50 tubes \nnot more than 75 tubes \nnot more than 75 tubes \nnot more than 125 tubes \n16. Product Marking \n16.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification \nA1016/A1016M, the marking shall include: the condition, hot \nfinished or cold finished; and the wall designation, minimum \nwall or average wall. \n16.2 For the austenitic stainless steels having a grain size \nrequirement (see Table 3) the marking shall also include the \nheat number and heat-treatment lot identification. \n16.3 When either T2 or T12 are ordered with higher sulfur \ncontents as permitted by Note B of Table 1, the marking shall \ninclude the letter, S, following the grade designation: T2S or \nT12S. \n16.4 For T91, the marking shall also include the type. \n17.
