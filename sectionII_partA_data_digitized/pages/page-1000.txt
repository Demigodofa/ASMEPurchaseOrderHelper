flattening and flaring tests and visual and dimensional exami­
nation shall be as follows: 
Lot Size (pieces per lot) Sample Size 
2 to 8 Entire lot 
9~ 00 8 
91 to 150 12 
151 to 280 19 
281 to 500 21 
501 to 1200 27 
1201 to 3200 35 
3201 to 10 000 38 
10 001 to 35 000 46 
In all cases, the acceptance number is zero and the rejection 
number is one. Rejected lots may be screened and resubmitted 
for visual and dimensional examination. All defective items 
shall be replaced with acceptable items prior to lot acceptance. 
28.1.4 Sampling for Chemical Analysis-One sample for 
chemical analysis shall be selected from each of two pipes 
chosen from each lot. A lot shall be all material poured from 
one heat. 
28.1.5 Sampling for Tension and Bend Test-One sample 
shall be taken from each lot. A lot shall consist of all pipe of the 
same outside diameter and wall thickness manufactured during 
an 8-h shift from the same heat of steel, and heat treated under 
the same conditions of temperature and time in a single charge 
in a batch type furnace, or heat treated under the same 
condition in a continuous furnace, and presented for inspection 
at the same time. 
28.1.6 Hydrostatic and Ultrasonic Tests-Each pipe shall be 
tested by the ultrasonic (when specified) and hydrostatic tests. 
28.1.7 Pipe shall be free from heavy oxide or scale. The 
internal surface of hot finished ferritic steel pipe shall be 
pickled or blast cleaned to a free of scale condition equivalent 
to the CSa2 visual standard listed in SSPC-SP6. Cleaning shall 
be performed in accordance with a written procedure that has 
been shown to be effective. This procedure shall be available 
for audit. 
28.1.8 In addition to the marking in Specification A450/ 
A450M, each length of pipe ¼ in. outside diameter and larger 
shall be marked with the following listed information. Marking 
shall be in accordance with FED-STD-183 and MIL-STD-792. 
(a) Nominal Pipe Size Schedule and Length (b) Heat or lot 
----------->c·dentifi.eatien;'lumber. 
28.1.9 Pipe shall be straight to within the tolerances speci­
fied in Table 3. 
28.1.10 When specified, each pipe shall be ultrasonically 
examined in accordance with MIL-STD-271, except that the 
notch depth in the calibration standard shall be 5 % of the wall 
thickness or 0.005 in., whichever is greater. Any pipe which 
produces an indication equal to or greater than 100 % of the 
indication from the calibration standard shall be rejected. 
28.1.11 The pipe shall be free from repair welds, welded 
joints, laps, laminations, seams, visible cracks, tears, grooves, 
slivers, pits, and other imperfections detrimental to the pipe as 
determined by visual and ultrasonic examination, or alternate 
tests, as specified. 
28.1.12 Pipe shall be uniform in quality and condition and 
have a finish conforming to the best practice for standard 
quality pipe. Surface imperfections such as handling marks, 
straightening marks, light mandrel and die marks, shallow pits, 
and scale pattern will not be considered injurious if the 
imperfections are removable within the tolerances specified for 
wall thickness or 0.005 in., whichever is greater. The bottom of 
imperfections shall be visible and the profile shall be rounded 
and faired-in. 
28.1.13 No weld repair by the manufacturer is permitted. 
28.1.14 Preservation shall be level A or commercial, and 
packing shall b¢ level A, B, or commercial, as specified. Level 
A preservation and level A or B packing shall be in accordance 
with MIL-STD-163 and commercial preservation and packing 
shall be in accordance with Practices A 700 or Practice D3951.
