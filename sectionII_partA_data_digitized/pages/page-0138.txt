TABLE A1.7 Permissible Camber for Carbon Steel Sheared or 
Gas-Cut Rectangular Plates all Thicknesses 
NoTE I-Camber, as it relates to plates, is the horizontal edge curvature 
in the length, measured over the entire length of the plate in the flat 
position. 
Maximum permissible camber, in. = 1/a in. x (number of feet of length/5)

TABLE A1.9 Permissible Variations from Flatness for Carbon Steel Plates 
NoTE I-Flatness Variations for Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and variation in flatness along the length shall not 
exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 12 ft in length, or in any 12 ft of longer plates. 
NoTE 2-Flatness Variations .f'or Width-The flatness variation across the width shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width. 
NoTE 3-When the longer dimension is under 36 in., the variation in flatness along the length and across the width shall not exceed \/4 in. in each 
direction. When the longer dimension is from 36 to 72 in., inclusive, the flatness vaiiation shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular ainonnt for the specified 
width, but in no case less than ¼ in. • 
Norn 4-The tolerances given in this table apply to plates that have a minimum specified tensile strength not over 60 ksi or comparable chemistry or 
hardness. For plates specified to a higher minimum tensile strength or comparable chemistry or hardness, the limits given in the table ai·e increased to 
1 ½ times the amounts in the above table. 
Norn 5-This table and notes cover the flatness tolerances of circular and sketch plates, based on the maximum dimensions of those plates. 
Norn 6-Plates shall be in a horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured.
