1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers 8 and 9% nickel-alloy 
steel forged or rolled flanges, fittings, valves, and parts 
intended for use in welded pressure vessels for low-temper­
ature service. The specification is applicable to forgings 
with maximum section thickness of 3 in. [75 mm] in the 
double normalized and tempered condition and 5 in. 
[125 mm] in the quenched and tempered condition. Forg­
ings under this specification are intended for service at 
operating temperatures not lower than -320°F [-196°C] 
for Type I or -275°F [-170°C] for Type II or higher than 
250°F [121 °C]. 
1.2 Material under this specification is available in two 
types having different chemical compositions as follows: 
Type 
I 
II 
Nominal Nickel Content, %

1.3 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound 
units and SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the 
material shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system must be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the specification.

3. General Requirements and Ordering 
Information 
3.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform 
to the requirements of Specification A 961, including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the pur­
chase order. Failure to comply with the requirements of 
Specification A 961 constitutes nonconformance with this 
specification. 
3.2 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in 
the purchase order all ordering information necessary to 
furnish the needed material. Examples of such information 
include but are not limited to the ordering information in 
Specification A 961 and following: 
3.2.1 Any supplementary requirements, and 
3.2.2 Additional requirements, (See 4.5, 5.2, 6.1, 7 .2, 
and 10.3). 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel shall be produced in accordance with the 
melting process section of Specification A 788. 
4.2 Material for forgings shall consist of ingots, or 
either forged or rolled blooms, billets, or bars. 
4.3 The finished product shall be a forging as defined 
in the Terminology Section of Specification A 788. 
4.4 Except for flanges of all types, hollow cylindrically 
shaped parts may be made from hot-rolled or forged bar,
