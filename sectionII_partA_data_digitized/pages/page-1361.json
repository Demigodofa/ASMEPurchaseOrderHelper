For pipe heat treated by the continuous \nprocess, or by direct quenching after hot forming, this test shall \nbe made on a sufficient number of pipes to constitute 5 % of the \nlot, but in no case less than two lengths of pipe. \n13.3.1 For welded pipe, a transverse guided face bend test \nof the weld may be conducted instead of a :flattening test in \naccordance with the method outlined in the steel tubular \nproduct supplement of Test Methods and Definitions A370. For \nwelded pipe with a specified wall thickness 2: 3/s in. [9.52 mm], \ntwo side bend tests may be made instead of the face bend test. \nThe ductility of the weld shall be considered acceptable when \nthere is no evidence of cracks in the weld or between the weld \nand the base metal after bending. Test specimens from 5 % of \nthe lot shall be taken from the pipes or test plates of the same \nmaterial as the pipe, the test plates being attached to the end of \nthe cylinder and welded as a prolongation of the pipe longitu\u00ad\ndinal seam. \n13.4 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests \nshall be made on specimens from two pipes from each lot (see \n13.2). \n14. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test \n14.1 Each pipe shall be subjected to the nondestructive \nelectric test or the hydrostatic test. The type of test to be used \nshall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise \nspecified in the purchase order. \n14.2 The hydrostatic test shall be in accordance with Speci\u00ad\nfication A999/A999M, except that the value for S to be used in \nthe calculation of the hydrostatic test pressure shall be equal to \n50 % of the specified minimum yield strength of the pipe. \n14.3 Nondestructive Electric Test-Nondestructive electric \ntests shall be in accordance with Practices E213 or E309. \n14.3.1 As an alternative to the hydrostatic test, and when \nspecified by the purchaser, each pipe shall be examined with a \nnondestructive test in accordance with Practices E213 or E309. \nUnless specifically called out by the purchaser, the selection of \nthe nondestructive electric test will be at the option of the \nmanufacturer. The range of pipe sizes that may be examined by \neach method shall be subject to the limitations in the scope of \nthe respective practices. \n14.3.1.1 The following information is for the benefit of the \nuser of this specification: \n14.3.1.2 The reference standards defined in 14.3.1.3 -\n14.3 .1.5 are convenient standards for calibration of nondestruc\u00ad\ntive testing equipment. The dimensions of these standards \nshould not be construed as the minimum size imperfection \ndetectable by such equipment. \n14.3.1.3 The ultrasonic testing (UT) can be performed to \ndetect both longitudinally and circumferentially oriented de\u00ad\nfects. It should be recognized that different techniques should \nbe employed to detect differently oriented imperfections. The \nexamination may not detect short, deep, defects. \n14.3.1.4 The eddy-current testing (ET) referenced in this \nspecification (see Practice E426) has the capability of detecting \nsignificant discontinuities, especially the short abrupt type. \n14.3 .1.5 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature \n(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can \nbe detected in the specific application of these examinations \nshould discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular \nproduct. \n14.4 Time of Examination-Nondestructive testing for \nspecification acceptance shall be performed after all mechani\u00ad\ncal processing, heat treatments, and straightening operations. \nThis requirement does not preclude additional testing at earlier \nstages in the processing. \n14.5 Surface Condition: \n14.5.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, paint, \nor other foreign material that could interfere with interpretation \nof test results. The methods used for cleaning and preparing the \nsurfaces for examination shall not be detrimental to the base \nmetal or the surface finish. \n14.5.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can \nproduce signals that interfere with the test. \n14.6 Extent of Examination: \n14.6.1 The relative motion of the pipe and the transducer(s), \ncoil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire pipe surface is \nscanned, except as in 14.6.2. \n14.6.2 The existence of end effects is recognized and the \nextent of such effects shall be determined by the manufacturer \nand, if requested, shall be reported to the purchaser. Other \nnondestructive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to \nagreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. \n14.7 Operator Qualifications-The test unit operator shall \nbe certified in accordance with SNT-TC- lA, or an equivalent \nrecognized and documented standard. \n14.8 Test Conditions: \n14.8.1 For eddy-current testing, the excitation coil fre\u00ad\nquency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration yet \nprovide good signal-to-noise ratio. \n14.8.2 The maximum eddy-current coil frequency used \nshall be as follows: \nOn specified walls up to 0.050 in.-100 KHz max \nOn specified walls up to 0.150 in.-50 KHz max \nOn specified walls over 0.150 in.-10 KHz max \n14.8.3 Ultrasonic-For examination by the ultrasonic \nmethod, the minimum nominal transducer frequency shall be \n2.00 MHz and the maximum nominal transducer size shall be \n1.5 in. If the equipment contains a reject notice filter setting, \nthis shall remain off during calibration and testing unless \nlinearity can be demonstrated at that setting. \n14.9 Reference Standards-Reference standards of conve\u00ad\nnient length shall be prepared from a length of pipe of the same \ngrade, size (NPS, or outside diameter and schedule or wall \nthickness), surface finish and heat treatment condition as the \npipe to be examined. \n14.9.1 For Ultrasonic Testing, the reference ID and OD \nnotches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes \nshown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The \ndepth of each notch shall not exceed 12 \u00bd % of the specified \nnominal wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in., whichever is \n1299 ",
