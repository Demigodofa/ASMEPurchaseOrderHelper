INTERNATIONAi. 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Carbon Steel, High Strength, for 
Moderate and Lower Temperature Service 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designationA612/A612M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers killed carbon-manganese­
silicon steel plates intended for welded pressure vessels in 
service at moderate and lower temperatures. 
1.2 The maximum thiclrness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the material to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.3 For plates produced from coil and furnished without 
heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the additional 
requirements, including additional testing requirements and the 
reporting of additional test results, of Specification A20/ A20M 
apply. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material supplied to this product specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted variations in dimensions and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3 .2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
where additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. 
3.3 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates 
produced from coil means plates that have been cut to 
individual lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or 
is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of 
coils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, 
leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, 
heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for 
shipment, and certification. 
Now 1-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat 
treatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are reported for 
each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plates from coil 
are described in Specification A20/A20M. 
3 .4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Mannfacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and 
shall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of 
Specification A20/A20M.
