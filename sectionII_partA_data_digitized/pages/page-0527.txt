3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for heavy hex structural bolts under this speci­
fication shall include the following: 
3.1.1 Quantity (number of pieces of bolts and accessories). 
3.1.2 Size, including nominal bolt diameter, thread pitch, 
and bolt length. 
3.1.3 Name of product, heavy hex structural bolts. 
3.1.4 When bolts threaded full length are required, Supple­
mentary Requirement S 1 shall be specified. 
3.1.5 Type of bolt: Type 1 or 3. When type is not specified, 
either Type 1 or Type 3 shall be furuished at the supplier's 
option. 
3.1.6 ASTM designation and year of issue. 
3.1.7 Other components such as nuts, washers, and com­
pressible washer-type direct-tension indicators, if required. 
3.1.7.1 When such other components are specified to be 
furnished, also state "Nuts, washers, and direct tension indica­
tors, or combination thereof, shall be furnished by lot number." 
3.1.8 Zinc Coating-Specify the zinc coating process re­
quired, for example, hot dip, mechanically deposited, Zinc/ 
Aluminum Corrosion Protective Coating or no preference (see 
4.3). 
3.1.9 Other Finishes-Specify other protective finish, if 
required. 
3.1.10 Test reports, if required (see Section 13). 
3.1.11 Supplementary or special requirements, if required. 
3.1.12 For establishment of a part identifying system, see 
ASME B18.24. 
NoTE 3-A typical ordering description follows: 1000 pieces l1/s-7 
UNC in. dia x 4 in. long heavy hex structural bolt, Type 1 ASTM A325-02, 
each with one hardened washer, ASTM F436 Type 1, and one heavy hex 
nut, ASTM A563 Grade DH. Each component hot-dip zinc-coated. Nuts 
lubricated. 
3.2 Recommended Nuts: 
3.2.1 Nuts conforming to the requirements of Specification 
A563 are the recommended nuts for use with Specification 
A325 heavy hex structural bolts. The nuts shall be of the class 
and have a surface finish for each type of bolt as follows: 
Bolt Type and Finish 
1, plain (noncoated) 
1, zinc coated 
1, coated in accordance with 
Specification F1136, Grade 
3 
Nut Class and Finish 
A563-C, C3, D, DH, DH3, 
plain 
A563-DH, zinc coated 
A563-DH coated in accor­
dance with Specification 
F1136, Grade 5 
3, plain A563-C3, DH3, plain 
3.2.2 Alternatively, nuts conforming to Specification A194/ 
Al 94M Gr. 2H are considered a suitable substitute for use with 
Specification A325 Type 1 heavy hex structural bolts. 
3.2.3 When Specification A194/A194M Gr. 2H zinc-coated 
nuts are supplied, the zinc coating, overtapping, lubrication, 
and rotational capacity testing shall be in accordance with 
Specification A563. 
3.3 Recommended Washers: 
3.3.1 Washers conforming to Specification F436 are the 
recommended washers for use with Specification A325 heavy 
hex structural bolts. The washers shall have a surface finish for 
each type of bolt as follows: 
Bolt Type and Finish 
1, plain (uncoated) 
1, zinc coated 
1, coated in accordance with 
Specification F1136, Grade 3 
3, plain 
3.4 Other Accessories: 
Washer Finish

3.4.1 When compressible washer type direct tension indica­
tors are specified to be used with these bolts, they shall 
conform to Specification F959, Type 325. 
4. Materials and Manufacture

temperature. Type 1 bolts produced from medium carbon steel 
to which chromium, nickel, molybdenum, or boron were 
intentionally added shall be quenched only in oil from the 
austenitizing temperature. 
4.1.2 Type 3 bolts shall be quenched only in oil from the 
austenitizing temperature.
