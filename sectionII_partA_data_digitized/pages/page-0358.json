A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon ( e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense . \n1. Scope* \nL 1 This specification 2 covers martensitic stainless steel and \nalloy steel castings for valves, flanges, fittings, and other \npressure-containing parts (Note 1) intended primarily for \nhigh-temperature and corrosive service (Note 2). \n1.2 One grade of martensitic stainless steel and nine grades \nof ferritic alloy steel are covered. Selection will depend on \ndesign and service conditions, mechanical properties, and the \nhigh-temperature and corrosion-resistant characteristics (Note \n3). \nNoTB I-Carbon steel castings for pressure-containing parts are cov\u00ad\nered by Specification A216/A216M. Low alloy quench-and-tempered \ngrades equivalent to Specification A217/A217M grades may be found in \nboth Specifications A352/A352M and A487/A487M. \nNoTB 2-The grades covered by this specification represent materials \nthat are generally suitable for assembly with other castings or wrought \nsteel parts by fusion welding. It is not intended to imply that these grades \npossess equal degrees of weldability; therefore, it is the responsibility of \nthe purchaser to establish for himself a suitable welding technique. Since \nthese grades possess varying degrees of suitability for high-temperature \nand corrosion-resistant service, it is also the responsibility of the purchaser \nto determine which grade shall be furnished, due consideration being \ngiven to the requirements of the applicable construction codes. \nNoTB 3-The committee formulating this specification has included \nnine grades of materials that are considered to represent basic types of \nferritic alloy steels suitable for valves, flanges, fittings, and other pressure\u00ad\ncontaining parts. Additional alloy steels that may better fulfill certain types \nof service will he considered for inclusion in this specification by the \ncommittee as the need becomes apparent. \n1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \n' This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee A0l on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.18 on Castings. \nCurrent edition approved March 1, 2022.

Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in nonconformance \nwith the standard. \n1.4 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
