9 .3 When required by the purchaser, the shear test specimen 
shall be taken near a top or bottom corner of the plate as rolled, 
parallel to its longitudinal axis, or other location that is 
representative of the final product. 
9.4 For plates 1 ½ in. (38 mm) and under in thickness, 
tension test specimens shall be the full thickness of the 
material, except as specified in 7.1.2 and 7.1.3. 
9.5 For plates over 1 ½ in. (38 mm) in thickness, tension 
tests shall be of the form shown in Fig. 3 and shall be of all 
base steel conforming to the requirements of the specification 
for the base steel. 
9.6 The bend test specimen used for bond strength determi­
nation shall be 1 ½ in. (38 mm) by not more than¾ in. (19 mm) 
in thickness and shall be machined to the form and dimensions 
shown in Fig. 2, or may be machined with both edges parallel. 
In reducing the thickness of the specimen, both the alloy 
cladding and the base steel shall be machined so as to maintain 
the same ratio of clad metal to base steel as is maintained in the 
plate, except that the thickness of the clad material need not be 
reduced below 1/s in. (3.1 mm). The sides of the bend test 
specimen used for bond strength determination may have the 
corners rounded to a radius not over 1/16 in. (1.6 mm) for plates, 
2 in. (50 mm) and under in thickness, and not over 1/s in. (3.1 
mm) for plates over 2 in. (50 mm) in thickness. 
10. Product Analysis 
10.1 Product analysis may be required for the cladding alloy 
on finished product. Chemical analysis may be accomplished 
by wet chemical or instrumental procedures. If wet chemical 
procedures are used, millings may be taken only when the 
composite plate thickness is sufficient to permit obtaining 
millings without danger of contamination from the adjacent 
layer. If spectrometric procedures are used, the sample shall be 
exposed on the center line of the cladding when there is 
in.

NoTE 1-The gage length and fillets shall be as shown, but the ends 
may be of any shape to fit the holders of the testing machine in such a way 
that the load shall be axial. The reduced section shall have a gradual taper 
from the ends toward the center, with the ends 0.003 to 0.005 in. larger in 
diameter than the center.

sufficient cladding thickness available so that there is no 
contamination from the adjacent base metal. 
10.2 If product analysis is specified by the purchaser for the 
cladding alloy, it shall be made on a sample taken from the 
finished product or a broken test specimen. For wet chemical 
analysis, in order to avoid contamination by the base plate 
metal, millings of cladding samples shall be taken from the test 
coupon by removal and discard of all the base metal plus 40 % 
of the cladding thiclmess from the bonded side, not to exceed 
1/16 in. (1.6 mm). The material shall be cleaned and sufficient 
millings taken to represent the full cross-section of the remain­
der. If there is insufficient cladding thickness available to 
spectrographically expose on the center line of the cladding 
without contamination, 50 % of the cladding shall be removed 
and the sample exposed on this surface. 
10.3 The results of the product analysis shall conform to the 
requirements of standards referenced in Section 2. 
10.4 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with the 
Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology of A751. 
10.5 Results of the product analysis for the backing steel 
when required shall conform to the requirements of Section 7 
of Specification A20/ A20M or A6/ A6M, as applicable. 
11. Permissible Variations 
11.1 Permissible variations except for thickness shall be in 
accordance with Specification A20/ A20M or A6/ A6M as 
applicable based on the backing specification. 
11.2 Minimum thickness of the alloy cladding metal and of 
the backing steel, or of the total composite plate shall be as 
required by purchase order documents when ordered to mini­
mum thickness. 
11.3 Permissible variation in thickness when ordered to 
nominal thicknesses shall be 0.01 in. (0.3 mm) under each for 
backing steel or total composite, and 0.03 in. (0.8 mm) under 
for the alloy cladding. 
11.4 Permissible vadations for excess thickness of the total 
composite shall be the greater of 0.125 in. (3 mm) or 10 % of 
the total composite thickness ordered and may occur in either 
backing steel, cladding, or both, provided the minimum for 
each is met. 
11.5 More restdctive or less restrictive permissible vada­
tions may be agreed upon by the purchaser and the manufac­
turer. 
12. Workmanship Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The matedal shall be free of injurious defects and shall 
have a workmanlike appearance.

12.2 Unless otherwise specified, the clad surface may be 
supplied as-rolled, blasted (descaled by means of sand, grit, 
shot or wire followed by pickling), or 100 % conditioned. 
13. Bond Quality 
13.1 The cladding metal shall be integrally and continu­
ously bonded to the base metal.
