If the \nresults of any tension test specimen are less than specified \nbecause a flaw becomes evident in the test specimen dming \ntesting, a retest shall be allowed provided that the defect is not \nattributable to ruptures, cracks, or flakes in the steel. \n9.4.2 If the average impact energy value meets the product \nspecification requirements, but one energy value is below the \nspecified minimum value for individual specimens, a retest is \npermitted. The retest shall be conducted in accordance with the \ntest methods specified herein. \n9.5 For the purpose of determining conformance to the \nproduct specification requirements, specimens shall be ob\u00ad\ntained from a finished product, or from production material that \nis in the same condition of working and heat treatment as the \nproduction material. \n10. Hardness Requirements \n10.1 The part shall conform to the hardness requirements \nprescribed in the product specification. \n10.2 Sampling for hardness testing shall conform to the \nproduct specification. \n11. Tensile Requirements \n11.1 The part shall conform to the tensile property require\u00ad\nments prescribed in the product specification. \n11.2 Sampling for tensile testing shall conform to the \nproduct specification. \n11.3 When the dimensions of the material to be tested will \npermit, the tension test specimens shall be machined to the \nform and dimensions of the standard 2-in. gauge length tension \ntest specimens described in Test Methods and Definitions A370 \nif inch-pound units are specified or the standard 62.5 mm \ngauge length tension test specimens described in the applicable \ntrack of Test Methods Al058 if SI units are specified. \n11.3 .1 In the case of small sections, which will not permit \ntaking the standard test specimen described in 11.3, the subsize \nround or strip specimen shall be machined as described in the \ntest methods being used. The tension test specimen shall be as \nlarge as feasible. \n12. Impact Requirements \n12.1 The part shall conform to the impact requirements \nprescribed in the product specification. \n12.2 Sampling for impact testing shall conform to the \nproduct specification. \n8 Product analysis limits for cobalt under 0.05 % have not been established and the \n12.3 Notched-bar impact specimens shall be simple-beam, \nCharpy-type A with a V-notch in accordance with Test Methods \nand Definitions A370 if the inch-pound units are specified or \nTest Methods A1058 if the M suffix (SI Units) standard is \nspecified. Standard specimens 10 by 10 mm in cross section \nproducer should be consulted for those limits. \ncNo over tolerance allowed. \n1393 ",
