When final heat treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot \nshaU include only those tubes of the same size and from the \nsame heat that are heat treated in the same furnace charge. \nWhen the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, the \nnumber of tubes of the same size and from the same heat in a \nlot shall be determined from the size of the tubes given in Table \n5. \n7.2 Tension and Hardness Tests-For tension and hardness \ntests, the term lot applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the \nsame nominal diameter and wall thic.kness that are produced \nfrom the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a \nbatch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the \nsame size and the same heat that are heat treated in the same \nfurnace charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous \nfurnace, a lot shall include all tubes of the same size and heat, \nheat treated in the same furnace at the same temperature, time \nat heat, and furnace speed. \nTABLE 5 Number of Tubes in a Lot Heat Treated by the \nContinuous Process \nSize of Tube Size of Lot \n2 in.
