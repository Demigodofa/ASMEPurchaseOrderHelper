TABLE 1 Heat Treatment Requirements 
Grade Heat Treatment 
1 B Heat to 1900 °F [1040 °CJ minimum, hold for sufficient time to heat 
casting uniformly to temperature, quench in water or rapid cool by 
other means. 
2A Heat to 2050 °F [1120 °C] minimum, hold for sufficient time to heat 
casting uniformly to temperature, quench in water or rapid cool by 
other means. 
3A Heat to 1950 °F [1070 °C) minimum, hold for sufficient time to heat 
casting uniformly to temperature, quench in water or rapid cool by 
other means. 
4A Heat to 2050 °F [1120 °C] minimum, hold for sufficient time to heat 
casting uniformly to temperature, and water quench; or the casting 
may be furnace cooled to a temperature no lower than 1850 °F 
[1010 °C], hold for 15 min minimum and then water quench. A rapid 
cool by other means may be employed in lieu of water quench. 
5A Heat to 2050 °F [1120 °CJ minimum, hold for sufficient time to heat 
casting to temperature, furnace cool to a temperature no lower than 
1910 °F [1045 °CJ, then quench in water or rapid cool by other 
means. 
6A Heat to 2010 °F [1100 °CJ minimum, hold for sufficient time to heat 
casting uniformly to temperature, quench in water or rapid cool by 
other means, or the casting may be furnace cooled to a temperature 
no lower than 1925 °F [1050 °C], hold for 15 min minimum, and then 
quench in water or rapid cool by other means. 
7A Heat to 2065 °F [1130 °CJ minimum, hold for sufficient time to heat 
casting to temperature, furnace cool to a temperature no lower than 
1940 °F [1060 °C], then quench in water or rapid cool by other 
means. 
5 .1.6 Additional requirements. 
6. Process 
6.1 The steel shall be made by the electric furnace process 
with or without separate refining. 
7. Heat Treatment 
7 .1 All castings shall be heat treated in accordance with 
Table 1. 
8. Chemical Composition 
8.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 2. 
9. Tensile Properties 
9.1 One tension test shall be made from each heat and shall 
conform to the requirements as to tensile properties prescribed 
in Table 3. 
10. Quality 
10.1 When additional inspection is desired, Supplementary 
Requirements S5, S6, and SlO may be ordered. 
11. Repair by Welding 
11.1 Repairs shall be made using procedures and welders 
qualified under Practice A488/A488M. 
11.2 The composition of the deposited weld metal may be 
similar to that of the casting or may be suitably alloyed to 
achieve the desired cmrnsion resistance and mechanical prop­
erties. 
11.3 Weld repairs shall be subject to the same quality 
standards as used to inspect the castings. 
12. Post-Weld Heat Treatment After Major Weld Repair 
12.1 Weld repairs shall be considered major in the case of a 
casting that has leaked on hydrostatic testing or when the depth 
of the cavity after preparation for repair exceeds 20 % of the 
actual wall thickness, or 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is smaller, 
or when the extent of the cavity exceeds approximately 10 in.2 
[65 cm 2 ]. All other weld repairs shall be considered minor. 
12.2 Castings shall be heat treated after major weld repairs. 
Heat treatment after minor weld repairs is not required unless 
Supplementary Requirement S 11 is included in the purchase 
order. 
12.3 Post-weld heat treatment shall be in accordance with 
Table 1.
