If not marked on the bundle tag, all \nrequired marking shall be on each length. \n25.2 When pipe sections are cut into shorter lengths by a \nsubsequent processor for resale as material, the processor shall \ntransfer complete identifying information, including the name \nor brand of the manufacturer to each unmarked cut length, or \nto metal tags securely attached to bundles of unmarked small \ndiameter pipe. The same material designation shall be included \nwith the information transferred, and the processor's name, \ntrademark, or brand shall be added. \n25.3 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 25.1 \nand 25.2, bar coding is acceptable as a supplementary identi\u00ad\nfication method. The purchaser may specify in the order a \nspecific bar coding system to be used. \n26. Government Procurement \n26.1 When specified in the contract, material shall be \npreserved, packaged, and packed in accordance with the \nrequirements of MIL-STD-163. The applicable levels shall be \nas specified in the contract. Marking for the shipment of such \nmaterial shall be in accordance with Fed. Std. No. 123 for civil \nagencies and MIL-STD-129 or Fed. Std. No. 183 if continuous \nmarking is required for military agencies. \n26.2 Inspection-Unless otherwise specified in the contract, \nthe producer is responsible for the performance of all inspec\u00ad\ntion and test requirements specified herein. Except as otherwise \nspecified in the contract, the producer shall use his own, or any \nother suitable facilities for the performance of the inspection \nand test requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by \nthe purchaser. The purchaser shall have the right to perform \nany of the inspections and tests set forth in this specification \nwhere such inspections are deemed necessary to ensure that the \nmaterial conforms to the prescribed requirements. \n27. Keywords \n27 .1 carbon steel pipe; seamless steel pipe; steel pipe \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nOne or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the \npurchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided \nin the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, \nretest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. \nSl. Product Analysis \nS 1.1 Product analysis shall be made on each length of pipe. \nIndividual lengths failing to conform to the chemical compo\u00ad\nsition requirements shall be rejected. \nS2. Transverse Tension Test \nS2. l A transverse tension test shall be made on a specimen \nfrom one end or both ends of each pipe NPS 8 [DN 200] and \nover. If this supplementary requirement is specified, the num\u00ad\nber of tests per pipe shall also be specified. If a specimen from \nany length fails to meet the required tensile properties (tensile, \nyield, and elongation), that length shall be rejected subject to \nretreatrnent in accordance with Specification A530/ A530M and \nsatisfactory retest. \nS3. Flattening Test, Standard \nS3 .1 For pipe over NPS 2 [DN 50], a section of pipe not less \nthan 2\u00bd in. [63.5 mm] in length shall be flattened cold between \nparallel plates until the opposite walls of the pipe meet. \nFlattening tests shall be in accordance with Specification \nA530/A530M, except that in the formula used to calculate the \n\"H\" value, the following \"e\" constants shall be used: \n0.08 for Grade A \n0.07 for Grades B and C \nS3.2 When low D-to-t ratio tubulars are tested, because the \nstrain imposed due to geometry is umeasonably high on the \ninside smface at the six and twelve o'clock locations, cracks at \nthese locations shall not be cause for rejection if the D-to-t ratio \nis less than ten. \n176 \nS3.3 The flattening test shall be made on one length of pipe \nfrom each lot of 400 lengths or fraction thereof of each size \nover NPS 2 [DN 50], up to but not including NPS 6 [DN 150], \nand from each lot of 200 lengths or fraction thereof, of each \nsize NPS 6 [DN 150] and over. \nS3.4 Should a crop end of a finished pipe fail in the \nflattening test, one retest is permitted to be made from the \nfailed end. Pipe shall be normalized either before or after the \nfirst test, but pipe shall be subjected to only two normalizing \ntreatments. \nS4. Flattening Test, Enhanced \nS4.l The flattening test of Specification A530/A530M shall \nbe made on a specimen from one end or both ends of each pipe. \nCrop ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is \nspecified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. \nIf a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility \nprior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening \ntest requirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat\u00ad\nment in accordance with Specification A530/A530M and \nsatisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails \nbecause of a lack of soundness, that length shall be rejected, \nunless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length \nis sound. \nSS. Metal Structure and Etching Test \nS5 .1 The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching \ntests conducted in accordance with the appropriate sections of \nMethod E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section \nfrom one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound ",
