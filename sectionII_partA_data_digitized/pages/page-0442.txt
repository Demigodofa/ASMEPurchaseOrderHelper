SA-265 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
13.2 Inspection: 
13.2.1 Clad plates less than% in. (10 mm) total minimum 
composite thickness shall be visually inspected for bond 
integrity p1ior to shipment. 
13.2.2 Clad plates 3/s in. (10 mm) and thicker total minimum 
composite thickness, and when specified by the purchaser, clad 
plates less than 3/s in. (10 mm) total minimum composite 
thickness, shall be ultrasonically inspected for bond integrity 
prior to shipment in accordance with the Procedures and 
Methods of Specification A578/A578M. 
13.2.3 Areas of non-bond detected visually shall be ex­
plored ultrasonically to determine the extent of the condition in 
accordance with 13.2.2. For purposes of defining non-bond, the 
cladding shall be interpreted to be unbonded when there is 
complete loss of back reflection accompanied by an echo 
indication from the plane of the interface of the clad and 
backing steel. Areas within 1 in. (25 mm) of a cut edge on the 
plate that contain indications exceeding 50 % of the back 
reflection at the bond interface shall be considered to be 
unbonded. 
13.2.4 Extent of ultrasonic examination shall be at the 
discretion of the manufacturer and sufficient enough to provide 
the quality level required by the purchaser. Plates may be 
ordered with 100 % coverage (see Supplementary Requirement 
Sl2). 
13.3 Quality Levels: 
13.3.1 Class I-No single unbonded area exceeding 1 in. 
(25 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not 
to exceed 1 % of the total cladded surface area. 
13.3.2 Class 3-No single unbonded area exceeding 3 in. 
(75 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not 
to exceed 3 % of the total cladded surface area. 
13.3.3 Class 5-No single unbonded area exceeding 9 in.2 
(58 cm 2 ) with total unbonded area not to exceed 5 % of the 
total cladded surface area. 
13.3.4 The class to be supplied shall be listed on the 
purchase order. When none has been specified, plates shall be 
furnished as Class 5 at the option of the manufacturer. 
14. Welding 
14.1 All welding which is a part of the delivered product, 
including any made in the fabrication of the cladding alloy 
component, shall be performed with a procedure and welders 
or welding operators that are qualified in accordance with 
Section IX of the ASME Code. 
14.2 The material manufacturer may repair defects in clad­
ding by welding provided the following requirements are met: 
14.2.1 When specified in the purchase order, prior approval 
shall be obtained from the purchaser. 
14.2.2 The defective area shall be removed and the area 
prepared for repair shall be examined by a liquid penetrant 
method to ensure all defective area has been removed. Method 
of test and acceptance standard shall be as agreed upon 
between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
14.2.3 The repair weld shall be deposited in accordance 
with a welding procedure and welding materials suitable for 
the cladding material. The surface condition of the repaired 
area shall be restored to a condition similar to the rest of the 
cladding. 
14.2.4 The repaired area shall be examined by a liquid 
penetrant method in accordance with 14.2.2. 
14.2.5 The location and extent of the weld repairs together 
with the repair procedure and examination results shall be 
transmitted as a part of the certification. 
15. General Requirements for Delivery 
15.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of Specification A6/A6M 
or A20/ A20M as appropriate for the backing metal. 
15.2 In the event of conflicts between this specification and 
the general delivery requirement specification for the backing 
steel, this specification shall apply. 
16. Certification 
16.l The chemical analysis of the base metal and the alloy 
cladding shall be certified to the purchaser by the clad plate 
manufacturer. 
16.2 The results of the tests in Section 7 and any other tests 
required by the purchase order shall be reported to the 
purchaser. 
390 
16.3 Compliance with the clad quality level of 13.3 shall be 
certified. Reports shall include the results of ultrasonic inspec­
tion when Supplementary Requirement S12 is specified. 
16.4 Compliance with any applicable construction code 
shall be certified and the appropriate documentation provided 
when appropriate in the case of explosively bonded clad 
produced using welded alloy cladding components (see 4.1.9 
and 4.1.11). 
17. Product Marking 
17 .1 Except as specified in plates shall be marked in 
accordance with the requirements of Specification A6/ A6M or 
A20/A20M for the backing steel as applicable, the cladding 
alloy designation, and this specification number. 
17 .2 For double-clad material or for material under % in. 
(6.35 mm) nominal in thickness or for clad plates provided 
with conditioned surfaces, the marking specified in 17. l shall 
be legibly stenciled instead of stamped when the material is 
shipped with the alloy smface up.
