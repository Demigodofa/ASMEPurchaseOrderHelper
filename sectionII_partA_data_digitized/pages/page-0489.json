Additional requirements regarding plates from coil \nare described in Specification A20/A20M. \n3.4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require\u00ad\nments of this specification shall prevail. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and \nshall conform to the fine grain size requirement of Specifica\u00ad\ntion A20/ A20M. \n5. Heat Treatment \n5.1 Plates 2 in. [50 mm] and under in thickness are normally \nsupplied in the as-rolled condition. Plates may be ordered \nnormalized, nonnalized and tempered, or stress relieved. \n5.2 Plates over 2 in. [50 mm] in thickness shall be normal\u00ad\nized or normalized and tempered. \n5.3 When normalizing plates 4 in. [100 mm] or over in \nthickness, the cooling rate may be accelerated by air blasting or \nliquid quenching followed by tempering in the temperature \nrange from 1100 to 1300\u00b0F [595 to 705\u00b0C] to obtain mechani\u00ad\ncal properties comparable to those developed by normalizing \nplates in the lesser thicknesses. \nGrade B \n80-100 [550-690] \n50 [345] \n15 \n18 \nGrade C \n80-100 [550-690] \n50 [345] \n17 \n20 \nGrade D \n80-100 [550-690] \n50 [345] \n17 \n20 \n5.4 If approved by the purchaser, for plates less than 4 in. \n[100 mm] in thickness, cooling rates faster than those obtained \nby cooling in air are permissible for improvement of \ntoughness, provided the plates are subsequently tempered in \nthe temperature range from 1100 to 1300\u00b0F [595 to 705\u00b0C]. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements \nshown in Table I unless otherwise modified in accordance with \nSupplementary Requirement S 17, Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized \nSteel, in Specification A20/A20M. \n7. Mechanical Properties \n7 .1 Tension Test Requirements-The plates, as represented \nby the tension test specimens, shall conform to the require\u00ad\nments given in Table 2. \n437 \n7 .1.1 For accelerated cooled plates with a nominal thickness \nof\u00be in. [20 mm] or less, the 1 \u00bd-in. [ 40-mm] wide rectangular \nspecimen may be used for the tension test, and the elongation \nmay be detennined in a 2-in. [50-mm] gage length that \nincludes the fracture and that shows the greatest elongation. \n8.
