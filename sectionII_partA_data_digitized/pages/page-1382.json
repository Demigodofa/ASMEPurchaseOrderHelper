Extraneous signals caused by \nidentifiable causes such as dings, scratches, dents, straightener \nmarks, etc., shall not be considered noise. The rejection \namplitude shall be adjusted to be at least 50 % of full scale of \nthe readout display. \n13.10.5 If upon any standardization, the rejection amplitude \nhas decreased by 29 % (3 dB) of peak height from the last \nstandardization, the pipe since the last calibration shall be \nrejected. The test system settings may be changed, or the \ntransducer(s), coil(s) or sensor(s) adjusted, and the unit \nrestandardized, but all pipe tested since the last acceptable \nstandardization must be retested for acceptance. \n13.11 Evaluation of Imperfections: \n13.11.1 Pipes producing a signal equal to or greater than the \nlowest signal produced by the reference standard(s) shall be \nidentified and separated from the acceptable pipes. The area \nproducing the signal may be reexamined. \n13.11.2 Such pipes shall be rejected if the test signal was \nproduced by imperfections that cannot be identified or was \nproduced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. These pipes \nmay be repaired per Sections 4 and 10. To be accepted, a \nrepaired pipe must pass the same non-destructive test by which \nit was rejected, and it must meet the minimum wall thickness \nrequirements of this specification. \n13.11.3 If the test signals were produced by visual imper\u00ad\nfections such as: \n( 1) Scratches, \n(2) Surface roughness, \n(3) Dings, \n( 4) Straightener marks, \n( 5) Cutting chips, \n( 6) Steel die stamps, \n(7) Stop marks, or \n(8) Pipe reducer ripple. \nThe pipe may be accepted based on visual examination \nprovided the imperfection is less than 0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or \n12\u00bd % of the specified wall thickness (whichever is greater). \n13.11.4 Rejected pipe may be reconditioned and retested \nproviding the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that \nrequired by this or the product specification. The outside \ndiameter at the point of grinding may be reduced by the amount \nso removed. To be accepted, retested pipe shall meet the test \nrequirement. \n13.11.5 If the imperfection is explored to the extent that it \ncan be identified as non-rejectable, the pipe may be accepted \nwithout further test providing the imperfection does not en\u00ad\ncroach on the minimum wall thickness. \n14. Product Marking \n14.1 In addition to that specified in Specification A999/ \nA999M, the marking shall include the manufacturer's private \nidentifying mark and identified as either single welded (SW) or \ndouble welded (DW) as applicable. For Grades TP304H, \nTP316H, TP321H, TP347H, and TP348H, the marking shall \nalso include the heat ti.umber and heat-treatment lot identifica\u00ad\ntion. If specified in the purchase order, the marking for pipe \nlarger than NPS 4 shall include the weights. \n14.2 DELETED \n14.3 When a hydrostatic test of the pipe is not performed, \nthe pipe shall be marked NH. \n15. General Requirements \n15.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con\u00ad\nform to the applicable requirements of the current edition of \nSpecification A999/ A999M unless otherwise provided herein. \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nOne or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the \npurchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided \nin the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, \nretest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. \nSl. Product Analysis \nS 1.1 For all pipes NPS 5 and larger in nominal size, there \nshall be one product analysis made of a representative sample \nfrom one piece for each ten lengths or fraction thereof from \neach heat of steel. \nS1.2 For pipe smaller than NPS 5, there shall be one product \nanalysis made from ten lengths per heat of steel or from 10 % \nof the number of lengths per heat of steel, whichever number \nis smaller. \nS 1.3 Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical \nrequirements specified in Section 5 shall be rejected. \nS2. Transverse Tension Tests \nS2.1 There shall be one transverse tension test made from \none end of 10 % of the lengths furnished per heat of steel. This \napplies only to pipe NPS 8 and larger in nominal size. \nS2.2 If a specimen from any length fails to conform to the \ntensile properties specified that length shall be rejected. \n1320 \n~ ",
