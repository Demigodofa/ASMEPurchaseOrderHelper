8 Unless otherwise indicated, a grade designation originally assigned by the 
American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). 
° Common name, not a trademark widely used, not associated with any one 
producer. 
5.8 Personnel performing NDE examinations shall be quali­
fied in accordance with SNT-TC-IA. 
5.9 Grade CR fittings shall meet the requirements of MSS 
SP-43 and do not require nondestructive examination. 
5.10 All fittings shall have the welders, welding operators, 
and welding procedures qualified under the provisions of 
Section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code 
except that starting pipe welds made without the addition of 
filler metal do not require such qualification. 
5.11 All joints welded with filler metal shall be finished in 
accordance with the requirements of Paragraph UW-35 (a) of 
Section VIII, Division I, of the ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code. 
5.12 Fittings machined from bar shall be restricted to NPS 4 
or smaller. Elbows, return bends, tees, and header tees shall not 
be machined directly from bar stock. 
5.12.1 All caps machined from bar shall be examined by 
liquid penetrant in accordance with Supplementary Require­
ment S52 in Specification A960/A960M. 
5.13 Weld buildup is permitted to dimensionally correct 
unfilled areas produced during cold forming of stub ends. 
Radiographic examination of the weld buildup shall not be 
required provided that all the following steps are adhered to: 
5.13.1 The weld procedure and welders or welding opera­
tors meet the requirements of 5.10. 
5.13.2 Annealing is performed after welding and prior to 
machining. 
5.13.3 All weld surfaces are liquid penetrant examined in 
accordance with Appendix 8 of Section VIII, Division 1 of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
5.13.4 Repair of areas in the weld is permitted, but 5.13.1, 
5.13.2, and 5.13.3 must be repeated. 
5.14 DELETED 
5.15 DELETED 
5.16 After final heat treatment, all "H-Grade" steel fittings 
shall have a grain size of 7 or coarser in accordance with Test 
Methods Ell2. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 All fittings shall be furnished in the heat-treated condition. 
For H grades, including Grade S33228, separate solution heat 
treatments are required for solution annealing; in-process heat 
treatments are not permitted as a substitute for the separate solution 
annealing treatments. The heat-treat procedure, except for those 
grades listed in 6.2, shall consist of solution annealing the fittings 
at the temperatures listed for each grade in Table 4 until the 
chromium carbides go into solution, and then cooling at a 
sufficient rate to prevent reprecipitation. 
6.2 A solution annealing temperature above 1950 °F [1065 
0 C] may impair the resistance to intergranular corrosion after 
subsequent exposure to sensitizing conditions in 321, 321H,
