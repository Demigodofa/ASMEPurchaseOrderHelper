SA-962/SA-962M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
the positions shown in Annex A3 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370 when inch-pounds are specified and to the 
form and dimension shown in Test Methods F606/F606M 
when M suffix (SI units) is specified. Impact tests are not 
required on material from externally threaded components 
when the thread diameter is ½ in. and under. 
9. Hardness Requirements 
9.1 The material shall conform to the hardness requirements 
prescribed in the product specification. Hardness testing shall 
be performed in accordance with Test M:ethods and Definitions 
A370 when inch-pound units are specified or to the applicable 
track of Test Methods A1058 if SI units are specified. 
9.2 Tensile tests prevail over hardness tests in the event a 
conflict exists relative to minimum strength unless otherwise 
specified in the product specification. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 Bars and Specimens Machined From Components­
The bolting component material shall conform to the tensile 
property requirements prescribed in the product specification. 
10.1.1 When the dimensions of the component material to 
be tested will permit, the tension test specimens shall be 
machined to the form and dimensions of the standard 2-in. 
[50-mm] gage length tension test specimen described in Test 
Methods and Definitions A370 when inch-pound units are 
specified or the standard length tension test specimens de­
scribed in the applicable track of Test Methods A1058 if SI 
units are specified. 
10.1.2 When the dimensions of the component material to 
be tested do not permit full size specimens, small size 
specimens meeting the requirements of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370 when inch-pound units are specified or the 
small size specimens described in the applicable track of Test 
Methods A1058 if SI units are specified shall be used. 
10.2 Testing of Full Size Components-Full size testing 
shall be as described in Test Methods and Definitions A370 
when inch-pound units are specified or as described in Test 
Methods F606/F606M when SI units are specified. 
11. Proof Load and Cone Proof Requirements 
11.1 Proof Load Test-Nuts shall be assembled on a 
threaded mandrel or a test bolt as illustrated in Fig. l(a) 
Tension Method or (b) Compression Method. The minimum 
proof load required by the product specification shall be 
applied using a free running cross head speed of 1.0 in. [25 
mm] per minute maximum and shall be held for at least 10 s. 
The nut shall resist this load without stripping or rupture, and 
shall be removable by hand, without use of tooling, after the 
load is released. A wrench may be used to loosen the nut 
one-half turn maximum to start it in motion. The test shall be 
discarded if the threads of the mandrel or test bolt are damaged 
during the test. 
11. 1.1 Mandrels shall have a hardness of 45 HRC minimum 
with threads of ·the appropriate series and conforming to the 
requirements of ASME B 1.1 Class 3A or ASME B 1. 13M 
tolerance 4H except that the maximum major diameter shall be 
the minimum major diameter plus 0.25 times the major 
diameter tolerance. 
11.1.2 The test bolt shall have threads appropriate to the 
standard specified for the nut being tested and shall have a 
yield strength in excess of the specified proof load of the nut 
being tested. 
11.1.3 The mandreVtension method shall be used when 
arbitration is required. 
11.2 Cone Proof Load Test-This test is performed when 
visible surface discontinuities become a matter of issue. The 
test uses a conical washer and threaded mandrel to determine 
the load-carrying ability of hardened steel nuts through 1 ½ in. 
[36 mm] in diameter assembled as shown in Fig. 2. The 
minimum cone proof load required by the product specification 
shall be applied using a free running cross head speed of 0.12 
0 .. d 0.015 in. [+0.38 mm] 
0.009 In. [ +o.22 mm)
