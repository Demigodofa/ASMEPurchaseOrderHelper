These requirements \nshall not be considered, unless specified in the order, in which even the necessary tests shall be made \nby the manufacturer prior to the bending or shipment of the tubing. \nSl. Nondestructive Ultrasonic Test-Round Tubing (Com\u00ad\nmercial Grade) \nS 1. 1 The manufactuer shall test the tubing by an ultrasonic \nnondestructive test for detection of harmful faults and sound\u00ad\nness. \nSl.1.1 Ultrasonic testing shall be performed using pulse\u00ad\necho shear wave techniques to locate longitudinal or circum\u00ad\nferential defects, or both. \nSl.1.2 Tubes being tested shall be reasonably straight for \nproper rotation. The outside and inside diameter surfaces of the \ntubes shall be free of dirt, grit, grease, oil, loose scale, or other \nmaterials which tend to attenuate, scatter, or reflect ultrasonic \nsignals. \nS 1.1.3 Tubing shall be inspected by feeding spirally past a \nsuitable transducer with rotation of material to be toward the \ntransducer. \nSl.1.4 Suitable ultrasonic instrumentation shall be used to \nSl.1.6.4 The recording equipment, if agreed upon, shall be \nadjusted to clearly indicate the reference notch or notches and \nalso whether or not any reflected signals actuate the alarm \nsystem. \nSl.1.7 A reference standard of an appropriate length (suffi\u00ad\ncient to allow in-line feeding) shall be prepared from a \nrandomly selected tube of the same size, grade, and physical \ncondition as the material to be tested. \nS 1.1.8 The reference standard shall contain machined \nnotches as follows: Notch to be 10 % of wall thickness in depth \nbut not less than 0.004 in. [0.10 mm]. Tolerance on depth \n+0.0000 in. or -0.001 in. [0.03 mm]. \nS 1.1.8.1 Notch Locations and Orientation-Notches shall \nbe located on outside or inside diameter, or both, and shall be \noriented to lie in a longitudinal direction for radial inspection \nor circumferentially, or both, for transverse inspection. The \nnotch or notches shall be located in the reference tube in such \na manner that no physical or acoustical interference exists \nbetween notches or end of reference tube. These various \nclearly distinguish the artificial defects (hereafter called refer- locations and orientations will be classified as follows: \nence notches) described later.
