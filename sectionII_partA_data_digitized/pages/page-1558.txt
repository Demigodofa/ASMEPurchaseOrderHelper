11. Product Marking 
11.1 In addition to the requirements of Specification A568/ 
A568M, each lift or coil shall be marked with the designation 
shown on the order (CS (Type A, B, or C), DS (Type A or B), 
DDS, EDDS, SFS (Grade, Carbon or Manganese or both), SS, 
HSLAS, HSLAS-F, RHS, FHS, SHS, or BHS). The designa­
tion shall be legibly stenciled on the top of each lift or shown 
on a tag attached to each coil or shipping unit.

TABLE 6 Hardness Requirements for Cold Rolled Steel Sheet 
Designations and Grades RHS and FHS 
Norn I-Hardness shall be measured using the appropriate hardness 
scale as stated in Test Methods El8, Figure A5.2, based on the steel 
thickness and hardness. 
NoTE 2-References to HRB are directly associated with references to 
HRBW as specified in Test Methods E18 and A370 subsection 18.2, in 
which the suffix letter W refers to the tungsten carbide ball indenter. 
NOTE 3-Rockwell Hardness provides a measure of resistance to 
penetration by a ball indenter under a fixed load, which is typically 
associated with a measure of abrasion resistance. Test Methods A370 
provides an approximate correlation to tensile strength, however hardness 
values are not as accurate a measure of ductility or strength, as compared 
to tensile test results and are not recommended as a substitute.

A Rockwell Hardness values apply at the time of shipment. Due to potential aging, 
hardness may be greater when tested at a later date. 
8 If conversion to cold-rolled annealed sheet or hot-dip metallic-coated sheet is 
intended, then ordering to Specification A1092 may be considered. 
c If tensile properties are required, SS Grade 80 may be considered.
