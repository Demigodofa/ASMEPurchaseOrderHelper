ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-788/SA-788M 
1.3 The purchaser may specify additional requirements (see 
4.2.3) that do not negate any of the provisions of either this 
specification or of the individual product specifications. The 
acceptance of any such additional requirements shall be 
dependent on negotiations with the supplier and must be 
included in the order. 
1.4 If, by agreement, forgings are to be supplied in a 
partially completed condition, that is, all of the provisions of 
the product specification have not been filled, then the material 
marking (see Section 17) and certification (see Section 16) 
shall reflect the extent to which the product specification 
requirements have been met. 
1.5 As noted in the Certification Section (16), the number 
and year date of this specification, as well as that of the product 
specification, are required to be included in the product 
certification. 
1.6 When the SI version of a product specification is 
required by the purchase order, Specification A788/A788M 
shall be used in conjunction with Test Methods A1058 instead 
of Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
1. 7 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.8 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica­
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.
