Mechanical Properties \n7.1 Tension Test Requirements-The matetial as represented \nby the tension test specimens shall conform to the requirements \nshown in Table 2. \n40 [275] 55 [380} \n40 [275] 50 [345] \n17 \n21 20 \n7 .1.1 For plates that have been heat treated in accordance \nwith 5.1.1.1 or 5.1.2 and have a nominal thickness of\u00be in. [20 \nmm] and under, the 1 \u00bd-in. (40-mm) wide rectangular speci\u00ad\nmen may be used for the tension test, and the elongation may \nbe determined in a 2-in. [50-mm] gage length that includes the \nfracture and that shows the greatest elongation. When this \nspecimen is used, the elongation shall be not less than 23 %. \n7.2 Impact Test Requirements: \n7.2.1 Plates of Grades A, B, D, and E that have been heat \ntreated in accordance with 5. l.1.1 shall be Charpy V-notch \nimpact tested.
