SA-307 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirement shall apply only when specified in the purchase order or 
contract: 
Sl. Bolts Suitable for Welding 
S 1.1 The material described in this section is intended for 
welding. This supplemental section, by additional chemical 
composition restrictions and by a carbon equivalent formula, 
provides assurance of weldability by chemical composition 
control. 
S 1.2 Welding technique is of fundamental importance when 
bolts produced to this supplementary section are welded. It is 
presupposed that suitable welding procedures for the steel 
being welded and the intended service will be selected. 
Sl.3 All of the requirements of this supplemental section 
apply in addition to all of the chemical, mechanical, and other 
requirements of the base specification, Specification A307 for 
Grade B. 
S 1.4 Because of the embrittling effects of welding tempera­
tures on cold-forged steel, this supplemental section is limited 
to hot-forged bolts, or, if not forged, then to bolts produced 
from hot-rolled bars without forging or threaded bars, bars 
studs, or stud bolts produced from hot-rolled bars without 
forging. Cold-forged bolts, or cold-drawn threaded bars, if they 
are given a thermal treatment by heating to a temperature of not 
less than 1500°F (815°C) and air-cooled are also suitable. 
S 1.5 Chemical Requirements: 
Sl.5.1 Heat Chemical Analysis-Material conforming to 
the following additional analysis limitations shall be used to 
manufacture the product described in this supplementary 
requirement. 
Carbon 
Manganese 
Phosphorus 
Sulfur 
Silicon 
0.30%, max 
1.00 %, max 
0.04%, max 
0.05%, max 
0.50%, max 
Sl.5.2 Carbon Equivalent (Source-Specification A706/ 
A706M)-In addition to the heat chemical analysis require­
ments in Sl.5.1, the heat analysis shall be such as to provide a 
carbon equivalent (CE) not exceeding 0.55 when calculated as 
follows: 
Sl.6 Analysis Reports-If requested on the order or con­
tract, the chemical composition of each heat of steel used and 
the calculated carbon equivalent for each heat shall be reported 
to the purchaser. 
Sl.7 Product (Check) Verification Analysis-Chemical 
analyses when made by the purchaser or a representative on 
bolts from each heat of steel, shall not exceed the values 
specified in Sl.5.2 by more than the following amounts: 
444 
Carbon 
Manganese 
Phosphorus 
Sulfur 
Silicon
