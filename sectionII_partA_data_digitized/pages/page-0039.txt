Interpretations 
(a) Interpretations clarify existing Code requirements and are written as a question and reply. Interpretations do not 
introduce new requirements. If a revision to resolve conflicting or incorrect wording is required to support the inter­
pretation, the committee will issue an intent interpretation in parallel with a revision to the Code. 
(b) Upon request, the committee will render an interpretation of any requirement of the Code. An interpretation can 
be rendered only in response to a request submitted through the online Inquiry Submittal Form at http://go.asme.org/ 
InterpretationRequest. Upon submitting the form, the inquirer will receive an automatic email confirming receipt. 
(c) ASME does not act as a consultant for specific engineering problems or for the general application or understand­
ing of the Code requirements. If, based on the information submitted, it is the opinion of the committee that the inquirer 
should seek assistance, the request will be returned with the recommendation that such assistance be obtained. In­
quirers may track the status of their requests at http://go.asme.org/Interpretations. 
( d) ASME procedures provide for reconsideration of any interpretation when or if additional information that might 
affect an interpretation is available. Further, persons aggrieved by an interpretation may appeal to the cognizant ASME 
committee or subcommittee. ASME does not "approve;' "certify," "rate;' or "endorse" any item, construction, proprietary 
device, or activity. 
(e) Interpretations are published in the ASME Interpretations Database at http://go.asme.org/Interpretations as they 
are issued.
