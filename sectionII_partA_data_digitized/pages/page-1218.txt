mm]. This reinforcement may be removed at the manufactur­
er's option or by agreement between the manufacturer and 
purchaser. The contour of the reinforcement shall be smooth, 
and the deposited metal shall be fused smoothly and uniformly 
into the plate surface. 
5.2.4 When radiographic examination in accordance with 
9.1 is to be used, the weld reinforcement shall be governed by 
the more restrictive provisions of UW-51 of Section VITI of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code instead of 5.2.3 of this 
specification. 
5.3 Heat Treatment-All classes other than 10, 11, 12, and 
13 shall be heat treated in a furnace controlled to ± 25 °F [15 
0 C] and equipped with a recording pyrometer so that. heating 
records are available. Heat treating after forming and welding 
shall be to one of the following: 
5.3.1 Classes 20, 21, 22, and 23 pipe shall be uniformly 
heated within the post-weld heat-treatment temperature range 
indicated in Table 2 for a minimum of 1 h/in. [0.4 hr/cm] of 
thickness or for 1 h, whichever is greater. 
5.3.2 Classes 30, 31, 32, and 33 pipe shall be uniformly 
heated to a temperature in the austenitizing range and not 
exceeding the maximum normalizing temperature indicated in 
Table 2 and subsequently cooled in air at room temperature. 
5.3.3 Classes 40, 41, 42, and 43 pipe shall be normalized in 
accordance with 5.3.2. After normalizing, the pipe shall be 
reheated to the tempering temperature indicated in Table 2 as a 
minimum and held at temperature for a minimum of ½ hhn. 
[0.2 hr/cm] of thickness or for ½ h, whichever is greater, and 
air cooled. 
5.3.4 Classes 50, 51, 52, and 53 pipe shall be uniformly 
heated to a temperature in the austenitizing range, and not 
exceeding the maximum quenching temperature indicated in 
Table 2 and subsequently quenched in water or oil. After 
quenching, the pipe shall be reheated to the tempering tem­
perature indicated in Table 2 as a minimum and held at that 
temperature for a minimum of½ h/in. [0.2 hr/cm] of thickness 
or for ½ h, whichever is greater, and air cooled. 
5.4 Grade 91 shall be produced only to classes 4X and 5X. 
In addition, post-weld heat treatment is required after weld 
repair. 
6. General Requirements 
6.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the applicable requirements of the current edition of Specifi­
cation A530/A530M, unless otherwise provided herein. 
7. Chemical Requirements 
7.1 Product Analysis of Plate-The pipe manufacturer shall 
make an analysis of each mill heat of plate material. The 
product analysis so determined shall meet the requirements of 
the plate specification to which the material was ordered. 
7.2 Product Analysis of Weld-The pipe manufacturer shall 
make an analysis of finished deposited weld metal from each 
200 ft [60 m] or fraction thereof. Analysis shall conform to the 
welding procedure for deposited weld metal. 
7.3 Analysis may be taken from the mechanical test speci­
mens. The results of the analyses shall be reported to the 
purchaser. 
7.4 If the analysis of one of these tests specified in 7 .1 or 7 .2 
does not conform to the requirements specified, analyses shall 
be made on additional pipes of double the original number 
from the same lot, each of which shall conform to the 
requirements specified. Nonconforming pipe shall be rejected. 
8. Mechanical Requirements 
8.1 Tension Test: 
8.1.1 Requirements-Transverse tensile properties of the 
welded joint shall meet the minimum requirements for ultimate 
tensile strength of the specified plate material. 
8.1.2 Number of Tests-One test specimen shall be made to 
represent each lot of finished pipe.

0 9CR steel is an air-hardenable steel, at times retaining austenite down to near atmospheric temperature. Good practice is to allow the steel to cool to 150 °For lower 
before subjecting the steel to a tempering treatment or post-weld heat treatment.
