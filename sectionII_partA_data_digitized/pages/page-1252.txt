SPECIFICATION FOR AGE-HARDENING STAINLESS 
STEEL FORGINGS 
SA-705/SA-705M 
<O 
INTERNATIONAL 
standards Worldwide 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 705/A 705M-95(2009).] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers age-hardening stainless 
steel forgings for general use. 
1.2 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
(metric) units are to be regarded separately as standards; 
within the text and tables, the SI units are shown in [brack­
ets]. The values stated in each system are not exact equiva­
lents; therefore, each system must be used independent of 
the other. Combining values from the two systems may 
result in nonconformance with the specification. 
1.3 Unless the order specifies an "M" designation, the 
material shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
NOTE 1 -Bar products are covered by Specification A 564/ A 564M.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify 
all requirements that are necessary for material ordered 
under this specification. Such requirements may include 
but are not limited to the following: 
3.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), 
3.1.2 Name of material (age-hardening stainless steel 
forgings), 
3.1.3 Dimensions, including prints or sketches, 
3.1.4 Type or UNS designation (Table 1), 
3.1.5 Heat treated condition (Section 5), 
3.1.6 Transverse properties when required (7.4), 
3.1.7 ASTM designation and date of issue, and 
3.1.8 Special requirements (5.3, 5.4). 
3.2 If possible the intended end use of the item should 
be given on the purchase order, especially when the item 
is ordered for a specific end use or uses. 
NOTE 2 - A typical ordering description is as follows: 5 age-hardening 
stainless steel forgings, Type 630, solution-annealed, ASTM Specification 
A 705 dated _ . End use: pump blocks for oil well equipment. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 In addition to the requirements of this specification, 
all requirements of the current edition of Specification 
A 484/A 484M shall apply. Failure to comply with the 
general requirements of Specification A 484 / A 484 M, con­
stitutes nonconformance with this specification. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Material for forgings shall consist of billets or bars, 
either forged, rolled or cast, or a section cut from an ingot. 
The cuts shall be made to the required length by a suitable 
process. This material may be specified to Specification 
A 564/ A 564M. 
5.2 The material shall be forged by hammering, press­
ing, rolling, extruding, or upsetting to produce a wrought 
structure throughout and shall be brought as nearly as 
possible to the finished shape and size by hot working.
