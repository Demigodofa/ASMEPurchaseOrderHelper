Xl. LAMELLAR TEARING ADJACENT TO WELDS 
XU Introduction 
Xl.1.1 Lamellar tearing is a particular type of cracking that 
occurs under the weld of a steel plate weldment. It is generally 
caused by strain induced in the thickness direction resulting 
from shrinkage of the weld deposit and by the restraint 
imposed by the components that comprise the weldment. High 
restraint increases the possibility of lamellar tearing. However, 
lamellar tearing is not solely confined to highly restrained 
weldments. Lamellar tearing may also result from loads on the 
plate surface. 
Xl.2 Characteristics of Lamellar Tearing 
Xl.2.1 Lamellar tearing normally occurs in susceptible 
material underneath the weld, in a direction generally parallel
