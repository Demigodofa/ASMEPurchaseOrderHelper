Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall conform to one of the requirements as to \nchemical composition as prescribed in Table 1. \n6.2 When a grade is ordered under this specification, sup\u00ad\nplying an alloy grade that specifically requires the addition of \nany element other than those listed for the ordered grade in \nTable 1 is not permitted. \n7. Product Analysis \n7.1 When requested in the purchase order, a product analy\u00ad\nsis shall be made by the manufacturer or supplier from one tube \nor billet per heat. \n7 .2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of \ntwo additional tubes or billets shall be made. Both retests for \nthe elements in question shall meet the requirements of this \nspecification; otherwise, all remaining material in the heat or \nlot (Note 1) shall be rejected or, at the option of the producer, \neach tube may be individually tested for acceptance. Tubes that \ndo not meet the requirements of this specification shall be \nrejected. \nNoTE 1-For tension and hardness test requirements, the term lot \napplies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall \nthickness which are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat \ntreatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of \nthe same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace \ncharge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, a lot shall \ninclude all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the same furnace \nat the same temperature, time at heat and furnace speed. \n7.3 For referee purposes, Test Methods A751 shall be used. \n8. Mechanical Properties \n8.1 Tensile Properties-The material shall conform to the \nrequirements as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2, \nwhen pulled in full section. \n8.2 Hardness Requirements-The tubes shall not exceed the \nRockwell Hardness shown in Table 3. \n9.

The wall thickness of \nthe tube in U-bent section shall be not less than value \ndetermined by: \nt.r= T (2R)/(2R+D) \nwhere: \ntr = wall thickness after bending, in. [mm], \nT = specified minimum tube wall thickness, in. [mm], \nR = centerline bend radius, in. [mm], and \nD = \u00b7nominal outside tube diameter, in. [mm]. \n(1) \n9.3 In the case of U-tubes, the length of the tube legs as \nmeasured from the point of tangency of the bend and the tube \nleg to the end of the tube leg shall not be less than specified, but \nmay exceed the specified values by the amount given in Table \n4. The difference in lengths of the tube legs shall not be greater \nthan 1/s in. [3 mm] unless otherwise specified. \n9.4 The end of any tube may depart from square by not \nmore than the amount given in Table 5. \n9.5 The leg spacing measured between the points of tan\u00ad\ngency of the bend to the legs shall not vary from the value (2R \n- specified tube OD) by more than 1/16 in. [1.5 mm] where R is \nthe centerline bend radius. \n9.6 The bent portion of the U-tube shall be substantially \nuniform in curvature and not exceed \u00b1 1/16 in. [ \u00b1 1.5 rnm] of the \nnormal centerline radius. - - - - - ______ 9~LP~fllli_ssible variations from the specified outside diam-\neter shall not exceecf\":\u00b1o--:0O4\u00b7in. lD---:-1DITllll]Torto:btng antler - -10:-Workmanship,-Finish,--and-Appearance__ ___ ____ _ \n1.0-in.

At the bent portion of a U-tube for R = 2 x D or \ngreater neither the major nor minor diameter of tube shall \ndeviate from nominal by more than 10 %.

A light oxide scale on the \noutside and inside surfaces of U-bend shall be allowed for \ntubes which have been heat treated. \n10.2 Finished tubes shall be reasonably straight and have \nsmooth ends free from burrs. Tubes shall have a workmanlike \nfinish and shall be free of surface imperfections that cannot be \nremoved within the allowable wall tolerances. Removal of \nsmface imperfections such as handling marks, straightening \nmarks, light mandrel and die marks, shallow pits, and scale \npattern will not be required provided they are within the \nallowable wall tolerances. \n10.3 Finished tubes shall be coated both on the outside and \nthe inside diameter to prevent corrosion in transit. The type of \ncoating applied should be mutually agreed upon and specified \nin the order. ",
