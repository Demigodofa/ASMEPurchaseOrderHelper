Scope \n1.1 This specification covers seamless and welded ferritic \nstainless steel feedwater heater tubes including those bent, if \nspecified, into the form of U-tubes for application in tubular \nfeedwater heaters. \n1.2 The tubing .sizes covered shall be 5/s to 1 in. [15.9 to 25.4 \nmm] inclusive outside diameter, and average or minimum wall \nthicknesses of 0.028 in. [0.7 mm] and heavier. \n1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA480/A480M Specification for General Requirements for \nFlat-Rolled Stainless and Heat-Resisting Steel Plate, \nSheet, and Strip \nA763 Practices for Detecting Susceptibility to Intergranular \nAttack in Ferritic Stainless Steels \nA941 Terminology Relating to Steel, Stainless Steel, Related \nAlloys, and Ferroalloys \nA1016/A1016M Specification for General Requirements for \nFerritic Alloy Steel, Austenitic Alloy Steel, and Stainless \nSteel Tubes \n3. Terminology \n3.1 Definitions-For definitions of terms used in this \nspecification, refer to Terminology A941. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all \nrequirements that are necessary for material under this speci\u00ad\nfication. Such requirements may include, but are not limited to, \nthe following: \n4.1.1 Quantity (length or number of pieces), \n4.1.2 Material description (seamless or welded), \n4.1.3 Dimensions (outside diameter, wall thickness (mini\u00ad\nmum or average wall), and length), \n4.1.4 Grade (chemical composition) (Table 1), and \n4.1.5 U-bend requirements, if order specifies bending, \nU-bend schedules or drawings shall accompany the order. \n4.2 Optional Requirements-Purchaser shall specify \nwhether annealing of the U-bends is required or whether tubes \nare to be hydrotested or air-tested (see 10.6). \n4.3 Supplementary Requirements-Purchaser shall specify \non this purchase order if material is to be eddy-current tested in \naccordance with Supplementary Requirement S 1 or S2, and if \nspecial test reports are required, under Supplementary Require\u00ad\nment S3, and, \n4.4 Any additional special requirements. \n5. General Requirements \n5.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to \nthe applicable requirements of the latest published edition of \nSpecification A1016/Al016M unless otherwise provided \nherein. \n6. Materials and Manufacture \n6.1 The tubing shall be manufactured by either the seamless \nor welded process. \n6.2 Seamless Tubing: \n6.2.1 Seamless tubing shall be supplied from a cold finish \nprocess. Hot finishing as the final sizing process is not allowed. \n6.3 Welded Tubing: \n6.3.1 The tube shall be made from flat-rolled steel by an \nautomatic welding process with no addition of filler metal. \n6.4 Surface contaminants may have detrimental effects on \nhigh temperature properties or corrosion resistance of tubing. \nContamination by copper, lead, mercury, zinc, chlorides, or \n1306 ",
