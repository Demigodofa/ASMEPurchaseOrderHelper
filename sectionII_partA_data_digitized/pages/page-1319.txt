3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions: 
3.1.1 The definitions in Test Methods and Definitions 
A 370, Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A 751, 
and Terminology A 941 are applicable to this specification 
and those listed in 1. 1. • 
3.1.2 test coupon, n - the part from which the test 
specimen will be extracted. 
3.1.3 test specimen, n - the part that will be acted 
upon in a test. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Melting Process - The steel shall be made by open­
hearth or electric furnace process with or without separate 
refining, such as argon-oxygen-decarburization (AOD), 
unless otherwise specified in the individual specification. 
4.2 Heat Treatment: 
4.2.1 Castings shall be heat treated in the working 
zone of a furnace that has been surveyed in accordance 
with Test Method A 991 / A 991M. 
4.2.2 When castings are heat treated at temperatures 
above 2000°F [1100°C], then the working zone shall have 
been established by a survey performed at not more than 
25°F [15°C] below nor more than 200°F [l 10°C] above 
the minimum heat treatment temperature specified for the 
grade. If a minimum heat treatment temperature is not 
specified for the grade, then the survey temperature shall 
be not more than 50°F [30°C] below nor more than 175°F 
[ 100°C] above the furnace set point used. 
4.2.3 The maximum variation in measured tempera­
ture as determined by the difference between the highest 
temperature and the lowest temperature shall be as agreed 
between the purchaser and producer except that during 
production heat treatment, no portion of the furnace shall 
be below the minimum specified temperature nor above 
the maximum specified temperature for the grade being 
processed. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Chemical Analysis - Chemical analysis of materi­
als covered by this specification shall be in accordance 
with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A 751. 
5.2 Heat Analysis - An analysis of each heat shall be 
made by the manufacturer to determine the percentages of
