SA-179 /SA-179M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Seamless Cold-Drawn Low-Carbon Steel Heat-Exchanger 
and Condenser Tubes 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
seamless cold-drawn low-carbon steel tubes for tubular heat 
exchangers, condensers, and similar heat transfer apparatus. 
1.2 This specification covers tubes 1/s to 3 in. [3.2 to 76.2 
mm], inclusive, in outside diameter. 
NoTE I-Tubing smaller in outside diameter and having a thinner wall 
than indicated in this specification is available. Mechanical property 
requirements do not apply to tubing smaller than Vs in. [3.2 mm] in outside 
diameter or with a wall thickness under 0.015 in. [0.4 mm]. 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for material under this specification should 
include the following, as required, to describe the desired 
material adequately: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material (seamless tubes), 
3.1.3 Manufacture (cold-drawn), 
3.1.4 Size (outside diameter and minimum wall thickness), 
3.1.5 Length (specific or random), 
3.1.6 Optional requirements (product analysis, Section 9, 
flange test, 11.3), 
3.1.7 Test report required (Certification Section of Specifi­
cation A450/A450M), 
3.1.8 Specification number, and 
3.1.9 Special requirements. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A450/ A450M, unless otherwise provided herein. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 Tubes shall be made by the seamless process and shall 
be cold drawn. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 Tubes shall be heat treated after the final cold draw pass 
at a temperature of 1200°F [650°C] or higher. 
7. Surface Condition 
7 .1 Finished tubes shall be free of scale. A slight amount of 
oxidation will not be considered as scale. 
8. Chemical Composition 
8.1 The steel shall conform to the following requirements as 
to chemical composition: 
Carbon, % 0.06-0.18 
Manganese, % 0.27-0.63 
Phosphorus, max, % 0.035 
Sulfur, max, % 0.035 
8.2 Supplying an alloy grade that specifically requires the 
addition of any element other than those listed in 8.1 is not 
permitted.
