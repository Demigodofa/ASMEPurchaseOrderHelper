Certification \n18.1 A test report, signed by an authorized employee or \nrepresentative of the manufacturer, shall be furnished to the \npurchaser to indicate the specification and grade, seamless or \nwelded, the results of the heat analysis, hardness and tensile \nproperties. Product analysis will be reported only when re\u00ad\nquested on the purchase order as provided in 4.1.7. \n19. Product Marking \n19.1 All tubes shall be marked with the heat number. \n19.2 Containers and packages shall be marked or tagged to \nshow the purchaser's order number, the manufacturer's order \nnumber, specification, seamless or welded, grade, size and wall \nthickness, minimum or average, number of pieces contained in \nthe package, and item number (if appropriate). \n20. Packaging \n20.1 All tubing shall be packaged and blocked in such a \nmanner as to prevent damage in ordinary handling and trans\u00ad\nportation. The boxes shall be constructed in such a manner that \nno nails, staples, screws, or similar fasteners are required to \nclose and secure the box after the tubes have been placed in the \nbox. The box shall be lined with plastic sheet or vapor barrier \nmaterials so as to prevent chloride contamination of the tube \nduring handling, transportation, and storage. \n20.2 The U-bent tubes shall be arranged in boxes so that the \nsmaller radius bends may be removed without disturbing larger \nradius bends. Tubes for an item number shall be boxed \ntogether. \n21. Keywords \n21.1 austenitic stainless steel; feedwater heater tubes; seam\u00ad\nless tube; stainless steel tube; steel tube; welded steel tube \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nThe following supplementary requirement or requirements may become a part of the specification \nwhen specified in the inquiry or invitation to bid, and purchase order or contract. These requirements \nshall not be considered, unless specified in the order, in which event the necessary tests shall be made \nby the manufacturer prior to the bending or shipment of the tubing. \nSl. Nondestructive Eddy-Current Test \nS 1.1 Each tube in the finished condition, except for bending \nif that is required, shall be tested by passing it through an \nelectric nondestructive tester capable of detecting defects on \nthe entire cross section of the tube. Suitable instrumentation \nshall be used to clearly distinguish the artificial defects. The \noutside and inside surfaces of the tubes shall be free of loose \nscale, metallic particles, or other material which would tend to \nrestrict signals or create electrical noise. The tubing shall be \ninspected by feeding it longitudinally through an inspection \ncoil or coils with a diameter suitable for the diameter of tubing \nto be inspected. The instrument calibration shall be accom\u00ad\nplished with a reference standard prepared from an appropriate \nlength of selected tubing of the same size, grade, and physical \ncondition as the material to be inspected. The standard shall be \nfed through the coil at the same speed at which the inspection \nof the tubing is performed. \nS1.2 The factors listed in S1.3 shall be selected or adjusted, \nor both, in accordance with the instrument manufacturer's \ninstructions, for the particular instrument involved as required \nto achieve optimum instrument distinction between the refer\u00ad\nence defects and plain portions of the tube. \nS1.3 The following as well as other factors involved shall \nnot be used in such a manner that they detract from the overall \nability of the instrument to detect defects: test frequency, \ndirect-current saturation level, filter networks, phase-analysis \ncircuits, coil diameter, and instrument gain. \nS1.4 The reference standard shall consist of a defect-free \nsample of the same size, alloy, and condition (temper) as that \nbeing tested, and shall contain longitudinal and circumferential \nnotches on the outside diameter establishing the rejection level \nof the tubing to be tested. Inside diameter notches, both \nlongitudinal and transverse, shall also be a part of the reference \nstandard. These inside notches may be larger than the outside \nnotches, and are intended for use only to assure instrument \nphase settings capable of yielding optimum inside surface \nsensitivity. \nS1.4.1 All notches shall be produced by EDM methods. The \noutside diameter notches shall be of the dimensions shown in \nTable S 1.1 and Fig. S 1. 1. \nS 1.5 All tubing shall meet this specification. The instrument \ncalibration shall be verified at the start of testing, after any shut \ndown of the test equipment, after any test equipment \nadjustment, or at least every \u00bd h of continuous production \ntesting or both. Tubes generating a signal above the outside \ndiameter calibration standard sensitivity level shall be rejected. \nTABLE S1 .1 Notch Depth \nWall,in. Depth,A in. Length, \nOD, in.
