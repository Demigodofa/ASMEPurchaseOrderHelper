SA-696 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Steel Bars, Carbon, Hot-Wrought or Cold-Finished, Special 
Quality, for Pressure Piping Components 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers hot-wrought and cold­
finished special quality carbon steel bars, in straight lengths 
only, subject to mechanical property requirements and intended 
for use in manufacturing components for pressure piping and 
other pressure-containing applications. 
1.2 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as standard. The values given in parentheses are mathematical 
conversions to SI units that are provided for information only 
and are not considered standard.

of Steel Products 
3. Classification 
3.1 The bars are furnished in two grades as follows: 
3.1.1 Grade B-Tensile strength 60 000 psi (415 MPa), 
minimum; yield strength 35 000 psi (240 MPa), minimum. 
3.1.2 Grade C-Tensile strength 70 000 psi (485 MPa), 
minimum; yield strength 40 000 psi (275 MPa), minimum. 
3.2 The bars are intended for machining, welding, hot 
forming, and threading by machining or cold rolling. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 Orders for material under this specification should 
include the following information: 
4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of bars), 
4.1.2 Name of material (carbon steel bars), 
4.1.3 Condition: hot wrought or cold finished (5.4.1), 
4.1.4 Finish (if descaled required, so state) (9.1), 
4.1.5 Dimensions (diameter, thickness, width, and length), 
4.1.6 Cross section (round, square, hexagon), 
4.1.7 ASTM designation and date of issue, 
4.1.8 Grade (Table 1 and Table 2), 
4.1.9 End use, and 
4.1.10 Additions to the specification and supplementary 
requirements, if required. 
NO'ra 1-A typical ordering description is as follows: 10 000 lb, Carbon 
Steel Bars, Hot Wrought, Descaled, 1.000-in. diameter by 10 ft, Round, 
ASTM A696 dated __ , Grade B; Supplementary Requirement Sl 
Straightness 0.125 in. in any 5 ft. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Melting Practice-The steel shall be made by one or 
more of the following primary processes: open-hearth, basic­
oxygen, or electric-furnace. The primary melting may incor­
porate separate degassing or refining, and may be followed by 
secondary melting using electroslag remelting or vacuum arc 
remelting. Where secondary melting is employed, the heat 
shall be defined as all of the ingots remelted from a single 
primary heat. 
5.2 Deoxidation-The steel shall be fully killed. 
5.3 Quality-The bars shall be special quality. 
5.4 Hot or Cold Working: 
5.4.1 The bars shall be hot wrought or cold finished as 
specified by the purchaser. 
5.4.2 Cold-finished bars reduced in cross-sectional area 
more than 10 % by cold drawing or rolling shall be heat treated 
as specified in 5.5.2. 
5.5 Heat Treatment: 
5.5.1 Except as provided in 5.5.2, the bars shall be furnished 
as-hot wrought or as-cold finished. 
5.5.2 Cold-finished bars cold worked in excess of 10 % (see 
5.4.2) shall be stress relief annealed at not less than 1200°F 
(649°C), normalized, or fully annealed. The specific heat 
treatment shall be at the option of the manufacturer.
