When the \nlonger dimension is from 36 to 72 in., incl, the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount for the specified width, \nbut in no case less than \u00bc in. \nNorn 4-The permitted variations given in this table apply to plates that have a minimum specified tensile strength not over 60 ksi or comparable \nchemistry or hardness. For plates specified to a higher minimum tensile strength or compatible chemistry or hardness, the permitted variations are 1 \u00bd \ntimes the amounts in this table. \nNorn 5-This table and these notes cover the permitted variations from a flat surface for circular and sketch plates, based upon the maximum \ndimensions of such plates. \nNorn 6-Permitted variations in waviness do not apply. \nNorn 7-Plates must be in a horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured. \nSpecified Thickness, Specified Weights, \nPermitted Variations From a Flat Surface for Specified Widths Given in Inches, in. \nin. lb/ft2 48 to 80, 60 to 72, 72 to 84, 84 to 96, 96 to 108, 108 to 120, \nexcl excl excl excl excl incl \nTo\u00bc, excl To 10.2, excl 15/32 % 11frn % \"\u00bdo 7/s \n\u00bctoo/a, excl 10.2 to 15.3, excl % '\u00be2 o/10 % 1 1/10 % \n% to \u00bd, excl 15.3 to 20.4, excl S/15 o/10 3/s \u00bco \u00bd \u2022Ao \n\u00bdto%, excl 20.4 to 30.6, excl %2 o/10 o/1s % \u00bd \u00bd \n%to 1, excl 30.6 to 40.8, excl %2 \u2022A\u2022 \u2022Ao o/1e % 7Ao \n1 to 2, incl 40.8 to 51.7, incl \u00bc %2 %2 o/10 5As o/1s \nTABLE S27.2 Permitted Variations From a Flat Surface for As-Rolled or Normalized Carbon Steel Plates Ordered to Half-Standard \nFlatness \nNorn I-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Along the Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and the permitted \nvariation from a flat surface along the length shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 3700 mm in length, or in any \n3700 mm of longer plates. \nNorn 2-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Across the Width-The permitted variation from a flat surface across the width shall not exceed the \ntabular amount for the specified width. \nNorn 3-When the longer dimension is under 900 mm, the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed 6 mm in each direction.
