0 End out-of-square is measured by (a) squaring from the center line of the web and (b) squaring from the center line of the flange. The measured variation from true 
squareness in either plane shall not exceed the total tabular amount.

A The permitted variations in length for split tees or angles are the same as those 
applicable to the section from which the tees or angles are split. 
8 The above permitted variations in depth of tees or angles include the permitted 
variations in depth for the beams or channels before splitting. Permitted variations 
in dimensions and straightness, as set up for the beams or channels from which 
these tees or angles are cut, apply, except: 
straightness = ¼ in. x (length in feeV5)
