Stabilizing Heat Treatment \nS5.l Subsequent to the heat treatment required in 6.3, \nGrades 321, 321H, 347, 347H, and 348 shall be given a \nstabilization heat treatment at a temperature lower than that \nused for the initial solution annealing heat treatment. The \ntemperature of stabilization heat treatment shall be at a \ntemperature as agreed upon between the purchaser and manu\u00ad\nfacturer. \nS6. Intergranular Corrosion Test \nS6.1 When specified, material shall pass intergranular cor\u00ad\nrosion tests conducted by the manufacturer in accordance with \nPractices A262, Practice E. \nNom SI-Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condition for \nlow carbon or stabilized grades, and on the as-shipped condition for other \ngrades. \nS6.2 A stabilization heat treatment in accordance with \nSupplementary Requirement S5 may be necessary and is \npermitted in order to meet this requirement for the grades \ncontaining titanium or columbium. \nS7. In-Process Heat Treatments \nS7.l For H grades, separate solution treatments are required \nfor solution annealing. In-process heat treatments are not \nperi:nitted as a substitute for separate solution annealing. \nSS. ASME Section III or Section VIII, Division 1, Con\u00ad\nstruction \nS8.1 Products furnished under this specification that are \nintended for application under the rules of Section III or \nSection VIII, Division 1, of the ASME Boiler and Pressure \nVessel Code shall be manufactured by holders of the appropri\u00ad\nate ASME Certificate of Authorization and Certification Mark. \nThe product is subject to all applicable requirements of Section \nIII or Section VIII, Division 1, including welding, heat \ntreatment, nondestructive examination, authorized inspection \nat the point of manufacture, and application of the Certification \nMark. \nS8.2 The applicable ASME Partial Data Report form, \nsigned by an Authorized Inspector or Authorized Nuclear \nInspector and a material test report shall be furnished for each \nlot of pipe. \nS8.3 The welded joints shall be full penetration butt welds \nas obtained by double welding or by other means that will \nobtain the same quality of deposited weld metal on the inside \nand outside. Welds using metal backing strips that remain in \nplace are prohibited. \nS8.4 In addition to the requirements of 15.1, for pipe that is \nnot heat treated, or that is heat treated in a continuous furnace, \na lot shall consist of each 200 ft [60 m] or fraction thereof, of \nall pipe of the same heat of plate starting material of the same \nthickness, subjected to the same heat treatment. For pipe that is \nheat treated in a batch-type furnace that is automatically \ncontrolled within a 50 \u00b0F [25 \u00b0C] range and is equipped with \nrecording pyrometers so that the heating records are available, \na lot shall be defined as for continuous furnace heat treatment. \nEach length of pipe shall be so marked as to identify each such \npiece of pipe with the lot and the material test report. \n573 ",
