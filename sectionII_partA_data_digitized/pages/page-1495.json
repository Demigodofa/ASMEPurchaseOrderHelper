Repair by Welding \n8.1 Repair by welding shall be in accordance with the \nrequirements of individual specifications using procedures \nand welders qualified in accordance with Practice \nA 488/A 488M. \n9. Flanges \n9.1 When a flange from a flanged casting is removed \nto make a weld-end casting, discontinuities may be \nobserved that would not have been detrimental in a flanged \ncasting. The disposition of the casting shall be subject to \nagreement between the purchaser and manufacturer. \n10. Quality \n10.1 The surface of the casting shall be free of adhering \nceramic, scale, cracks, and hot tears as determined by visual \nexamination. Other surface discontinuities shall meet the \nvisual acceptance standards specified in the order. Unac\u00ad\nceptable visual surface discontinuities shall be removed \nand their removal verified by visual examination of the \nresultant cavities. \n10.2 The castings shall not be peened, plugged, or \nimpregnated to stop leaks. \n10.3 When additional inspection is desired, Supplemen\u00ad\ntary Requirements S4, S5, S7, or SlO may be specified. \n11. Hydrostatic Tests \n11.1 Each casting shall be tested after machining to \nthe hydrostatic shell test pressures prescribed in ANSI \nB16.5 for the applicable steel rating for which the casting \nis designed. The casting shall not show any leaks. Castings \nordered for working pressures other than those in the stan\u00ad\ndard ANSI ratings, or those listed for which test pressures \nare not specified by ANSI B16.5, shall be tested at a pres\u00ad\nsure agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. \n11.2 It is realized that the foundry may be unable to \nperform the hydrostatic test prior to shipment, or that the \npurchaser may wish to defer testing until additional work \nor machining has been performed on the casting. Castings \nordered in the rough state for final machining by the pur\u00ad\nchaser may be tested hydrostatically prior to shipment by \nthe manufacturer at pressures to be agreed upon with the \npurchaser. The foundry, however, is responsible for the \nsatisfactory performance of the casting under the final test \nrequired in 1 1. 1. \n12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n12.1 All castings shall be made in a workmanlike man\u00ad\nner and shall conform to the dimensions on drawings fur\u00ad\nnished by the purchaser. When the pattern is supplied by \nthe purchaser or is produced using a die supplied by the \npurchaser, the dimensions of the casting shall be as predi\u00ad\ncated by the pattern or die, unless otherwise agreed upon. \n12.2 Machined welding ends shall be suitably protected \nagainst damage during shipping. \n13. Retests \n13.1 If the results of the mechanical tests do not con\u00ad\nform to the requirements specified, retests are permitted \nas outlined in Test Methods and Definitions A 370. At the \nmanufacturer's option, castings may be reheat treated and \nretested. Testing after reheat treatment shall consist of the \nfull number of specimens taken from locations complying \nwith the specification or order. \n14. Inspection \n14.1 The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's \ninspector all reasonable facilities necessary to satisfy that \nthe material is being produced and furnished in accordance \nwith the applicable specification. Foundry inspection by \nthe purchaser shall not interfere unnecessarily with the \nmanufacturer's operations. All tests and inspections, with \nthe exception of product analysis (5.2), are the responsibil\u00ad\nity of the manufacturer. \n15. Rejection and Rehearing \n15.1 Any rejection based on test reports shall be \nreported to the manufacturer within 30 days from the \nreceipt of the test reports by the purchaser. \n15.2 Material that shows unacceptable discontinuities \nas determined by the acceptance standards specified in the \norder subsequent to its acceptance at the manufacturer's \nworks will be rejected, and the manufacturer shall be noti\u00ad\nfied within 30 days after discovery of the rejectable con\u00ad\ndition. \n15.3 Samples that represent rejected material shall be \npreserved for two weeks from the date of transmission of \nthe test report. In case of dissatisfaction with the results \nof the tests, the manufacturer may make claim for a rehear\u00ad\ning with that time. \n16. Certification \n16.1 The manufacturer's certification shall be furnished \nto the purchaser stating that the material was manufactured, \n1437 ",
