INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless and Welded Ferritic/Austenitic Stainless Steel 
Pipe 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A 790/ A 790M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon(,:) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1. 1 This specification 2 covers seamless and straight-seam 
welded ferritic/austenitic steel pipe intended for general corro­
sive service, with particular emphasis on resistance to stress 
corrosion cracking. These steels are susceptible to embrittle­
ment if used for prolonged periods at elevated temperatures. 
1.2 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for 
pipe when a greater degree of testing is desired. These 
supplementary requirements call for additional tests to be made 
and, when desired, one or more of these may be specified in the 
order. 
1.3 Appendix Xl of this specification lists the dimensions of 
welded and seamless stainless steel pipe as shown in ANSI 
B36.19. Pipe having other dimensions may be furnished 
provided such pipe complies with all other requirements of this 
specification. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the M 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
Norn 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as nominal 
diameter, size, and nominal size. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
