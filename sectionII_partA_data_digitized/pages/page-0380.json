A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers wrought carbon steel and \nalloy steel fittings of seamless and welded construction covered \nby the latest revision of ASME B16.9, B16.11, MSS-SP-79, \nMSS-SP-83, MSS-SP-95, and MSS-SP-97. These fittings are \nfor use in pressure piping and in pressure vessel fabrication for \nservice at moderate and elevated temperatures. Fittings differ\u00ad\ning from these ASME and MSS standards shall be furnished in \naccordance with Supplementary Requirement S58 of Specifi\u00ad\ncation A960/ A960M. \n1.2 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for \nfittings where a greater degree of examination is desired. When \ndesired, one or more of these supplementary requirements may \nbe specified in the order. \n1.3 This specification does not cover cast welding fittings or \nfittings machined from castings. Cast steel welding fittings are \ngoverned by Specifications A216/A216M and A217/A217M. \n1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units \nand in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the \napplicable \"M\" specification designation (SI units), the mate\u00ad\nrial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. \n1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. \n1.6 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee A0l on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.22 on Steel Forgings and Wrougbt Fittings for Piping Applications and Bolting \nMaterials for Piping and Special Purpose Applications. \nCurrent edition approved May 1, 2023.
