SA-182/SA-182M (ASTM A182/A182M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
13.5.3 If the imperfection is explored to the extent that it can 
be identified as non-rejectable, the forging may be accepted 
without further test provided that the imperfection does not 
encroach on the minimum required wall thickness. 
14. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion 
Protection 
14.1 Forgings and finished parts shall conform to the 
requirements of Specification A961/A961M. 
14.2 The forgings and finished parts shall be free of scale, 
machining burrs which might hinder fit-up, and other injurious 
imperfections as defined herein. The forgings and finished parts 
shall have a workmanlike finish, and machined surfaces ( other 
than surfaces having special requirements) shall have a surface 
finish not to exceed 250 AA (arithmetic average) roughness 
height. 
15. Repair by Welding 
15.1 Weld repairs shall be permitted (see Supplementary 
Requirement S58 of Specification A961/A961M) at the discre­
tion of the manufacturer with the following limitations and 
requirements: 
15 .1.1 The welding procedure and welders shall be qualified 
in accordance with Section IX of the ASME Boiler and 
Pressure Vessel Code. 
15.1..2 The weld metal shall be deposited using the elec­
trodes specified in Table 4 except as otherwise provided in 
Supplementary Requirement S5. The electrodes shall be pur­
chased in accordance with AWS Specifications A5.4/A5.4M, 
A5.5/A5.5M, A5.9/A5.9M, A5.ll/A5.11M, A5.14/A5.14M, 
A5.23/A5.23M, A5.28/A5.28M, or A5.29/A5.29M. The sub­
merged arc process with neutral flux, the gas metal-arc process, 
the gas tungsten-arc process, and gas shielded processes using 
flux-core consumables, may be used. For weld deposits made 
on S20910, the deposited weld metal shall correspond to either 
the alloy content of the base metal or AWS A5.4 E209 or A5.9 
ER209. For weld deposits made on N08367, N08700, N08925 
or N08926, the deposited weld metal shall correspond to either 
the alloy content of the base metal or one of the following filler 
metals in AWS A5.ll ENiCrMo-3 or A5.14 ERNiCrMo-3, 
A5.ll ENiCrMo-4 or A5.14 ERNiCrMo-4, or A5.11 
ENiCrMo-10 or A5.14 ERNiCrMo-10. For weld deposits made 
on N08020, the deposited weld metal shall correspond to either 
the alloy content of the base metal or AWS A5.4 E320/E320LR 
or A5.9 ER320/320LR. For weld deposits made on N08800, 
N08810 and N08811, the deposited weld metal shall corre­
spond to either the alloy content of the base metal or A WS 
A5.ll ENiCr-3 or A5.14 ERNiCr-3. However, the fillers used 
on these alloys (as well as other listed above) may be 
dependent on the end service use and service temperature and 
shall be agreed upon between purchaser and manufacturer. 
15.1.2.1 Weld deposits made on S20910, N08020, N08367, 
N08700, N08800, N08810, N08811, N08925, N08926, and 
F35030 (UNS S35030) shall be made using filler metal with a 
composition conforming to the base material or the equivalent 
classification in the AWS Filler Metal Specification A5.11 and 
A5.14. It is possible that weld deposit chemistry will not meet 
the limits· of either the base metal or the filler metal for some 
elements. The weld deposit chemistry shall meet the lowest 
minimum and highest maximum values for each specification 
element in either of the base metal or filler metal specification. 
Dilution of the base metal and filler metal must be considered 
when determining weld deposit criteria for over-alloyed filler 
metals. In either case, the weld deposit chemistry shall be 
tested and recorded on the Procedure Qualification Record. 
15.1.3 Defects shall be completely removed prior to weld­
ing by chipping or grinding to sound metal as verified by 
magnetic-particle inspection in accordance with Test Method 
A275/A275M for the low alloy steels and ferritic, martensitic, 
or ferritic-austenitic stainless steels, or by liquid-penetrant 
inspection in accordance with Test Method E165/E165M for 
all grades. 
15 .1.4 After repair welding, the welded area shall be ground 
smooth to the original contour and shall be completely free of 
defects as verified by magnetic-particle or liquid-penetrant 
inspection, as applicable. 
15.1.5 The preheat, interpass temperature, and post-weld 
heat treatment requirements given in Table 4 shall be met. 
Austenitic stainless steel forgings may be repair-welded with­
out the post-weld heat treatment of Table 4, provided purchaser 
approval is obtained prior to repair. 
15.1.6 Repair by welding shall not exceed 10 % of the 
surface area of the forging nor 331/3 % of the wall thickness of 
the finished forging or 3/s in. [9.5 mm], whichever is less, 
without prior approval of the purchaser. 
15.1.7 When approval of the purchaser is obtained, the 
limitations set forth in 15.1.6 may be exceeded, but all other 
requirements of Section 15 shall apply. 
15.1.8 No weld repairs are permitted for F 6a Classes 3 and 
4. 
15.1.9 Post-weld heat treatment times for F 36 are: for Class 
• 1, up to 2 in. [50 mm] in thickness, 1 h per in. [25 nun], 15 
minutes minimum, and over 2 in. [50 mm], 15 minutes for each 
additional in. of thickness or fraction thereof; for Class 2, 1 h 
per in. [25 mm], ½ h minimum.

17. Rejection and Rehearing 
17 .1 The purchaser shall comply with the provisions of 
Specification A961/A961M. 
18. Certification 
18.1 In addition to the certification requirements of Speci­
fication A961/A961M, test reports shall be furnished to the 
purchaser or his representative.
