both) based upon the proof stresses shown in Table 5 and Table 
6 of Specification A194/A194M. 
8.3.2 Number of Tests-The manufacturer shall sample and 
test the number of nuts specified in 8.1.2.1. The lot shall be 
considered acceptable if the sample nut(s) withstand(s) appli­
cation of the cone proof load without failure. 
9. Dimensions 
9.1 Nuts shall be hexagonal in shape, and in accordance 
with the dimensions for the hex or heavy hex series, as 
required, in ASME B 18.2.2 (for inch nuts) or ASME B 
18.2.4.6M (for metric nuts). Unless otherwise specified, the 
American National Standard Heavy Hex Series shall be used 
and nuts shall be either double chamfered or have a machined 
or forged washer face, at the option of the manufacturer, and, 
conform to the angularity requirements of ASME B 18.2.2 (for 
inch nuts) or ASME B 18.2.4.6M (for metric nuts). 
9.2 Unless otherwise specified, threads shall be in accor­
dance with ASME B 1.1 or ASME B 1.13M, and shall be 
gauged in accordance with ASME B 1.2 and ASME B 1.13M 
as described in 9.2.1 and 9.2.2. 
9.2.1 Nuts up to and including 1 in. nominal size shall be 
UNC Series Class 2B fit. Metric nuts up to and including M24 
nominal size shall be coarse thread series tolerance 6H. 
9.2.2 Nuts over 1 in. nominal size shall be either UNC 
Series Class 2B fit or 8 UN Series Class 2B fit. Unless 
otherwise specified, the 8 UN series shall be furnished. Metric 
nuts over M24 nominal size shall be coarse thread series 
tolerance 6H. 
NoTE 1-Modification of thread dimensions may result in loss of load 
can·ying ability. 
10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
10.1 Nuts shall be free of defects and shall be good 
commercial finish. 
10.2 If visible surface imperfections in size Y4 through 
1 ½ in. and M12 through M36 and in any grade other than 
Grade 8 become a matter of issue between the manufacturer 
and the purchaser, the cone proof load test described in 8.3 
shall be employed. 
10.3 If a scale-free bright finish is required, this shall be 
specified on the purchase order. 
11. Retests 
11.1 Provisions for retests by the purchaser and his repre­
sentative are specified in Supplementary Requirement S2. 
12. Certification 
12.l In addition to the requirements of Specification A962/ 
A962M, the certification shall include the results of the 
chemical analysis, macroetch examination (Carbon and Alloy 
Steels Only), mechanical tests, and the minimum tempering 
temperature for nuts of Grades 2H, 2HM, 3, 6, 6F, 7, 7M, and 
43. 
13. Product Marking 
13.1 In addition to the requirements of Specification A962/ 
A962M, nuts shall be legibly marked on one face with marking 
representing the grade, type, and applicable manufacturing 
process shown in Table 7. Marking of wrench flats or bearing 
surfaces is not permitted unless agreed upon between manu­
facturer and purchaser.
