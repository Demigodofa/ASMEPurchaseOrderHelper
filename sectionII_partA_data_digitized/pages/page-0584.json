There shall be the same number of test sets as \ntension tests in 7.1.2. \n7.2.3 Test Locations and Orientations-The test specimen \nshall be located and oriented as described in 7.1.3. The area \nunder the notch of the impact test specimen shall be used to \nlocate the specimen with respect to the second heat-treated \nsurface. The base of the notch shall be perpendicular to the \nnearest heat-treated surface. \n7.2.4 Test Method-The notched bar impact test shall be \nmade in accordance with the procedure for the Charpy V-notch \ntype test as specified in Specification A961/A961M. \n7.2.4.1 Standard size specimens shall be used for the impact \ntest. Where the material is of insufficient thickness, or the \nshape of the forging precludes standard size, the largest \nobtainable subsize specimen shall be used. \n7.2.4.2 Where subsize specimens are used and represent \nforged material with thicknesses equal to or greater than \n0.394 in. [10 mm], and where the largest obtainable specimen \nhas a width along the notch of at least 8 mm, such specimen \nshall be tested at the temperature in Table 4. Where the largest \nobtainable specimen has a width along the notch less than \n8 mm, the temperature for testing shall be lower than the \ntemperature in Table 4 by the amount shown in Table 6 for the \nactual specimen width tested. \n532 \n7 .2.4.3 Where subsize specimens are used and represent \nforged material with thicknesses less than 0.394 in. [10 mm], \nand where the largest obtainable specimen has a width along \nthe notch of at least 80 % of the forging thickness, the \nspecimen shall be tested at the temperature in Table 4. Where \nthe largest obtainable specimen has a width along the notch of \nless than 80 % of the material thickness, the temperature for \ntesting shall be lower than the temperature in Table 4 by an \namount equal to the difference (referring to Table 6) between \nthe temperature reduction corresponding to the thickness of the \nmaterial represented, and the temperature reduction corre\u00ad\nsponding to the specimen width actually tested. \n7.3 Hardness Test: \n7.3.l Except when only one forging is produced, a mini\u00ad\nmum of two forgings shall be hardness tested per batch or \ncontinuous run as defined in 7 .1.2.1 to ensure that hardness of \nthe forgings does not exceed 197 HBW after heat treatment for \nmechanical properties. The hardness measurements shall be \nmade as specified in Specification A961/A961M. When only \none forging is produced, it shall be hardness tested to ensure \nthat it meets the 197 HB W maximum of this specification. The \npurchaser may verify that this requirement has been met by \ntesting at any location on the forging, provided that such \ntesting does not render the forging useless. \n8. Hydrostatic Test \n8.1 Forgings manufactured under this specification shall be \ncapable of passing a hydrostatic test compatible with the rating \nTABLE 6 Charpy Impact Test Temperature Reduction Below Table \n4 Test Temperature when the Subsize Charpy Impact Width along \nNotch is Less than 80% of the Forging Thickness \nThickness of the \nMaterial Represented Temperature \nSize of Bar (see 7.2.4.3), or Reduction, Charpy, I mp act 'F ['Cl Specimen Width Along \nthe NotchA , in.
