CAMBER TOLERANCESA OF HOT-ROLLED STRIP 
(CARBON AND HIGH-STRENGTH LOW-ALLOY) 
(COILS AND CUT LENGTHS, INCLUDING PICKLED, 
APPLICABLE TO MILL EDGE, SQUARE EDGE, AND 
SLIT OR CUT EDGE) 
For strip wider than l ½ in. - ¾ in. in any 8 ft. 
For strip l½ in. and narrower - ½ in. in any 8 ft. 
NOTE l - Camber is the deviation of a side edge from a straight line. 
The standard for measuring this deviation is based on any 8 ft length. 8 
It is obtained by placing an 8 ft straightedge on the concave side 
and measuring the maximum distance between the strip edge and the 
straightedge. 
A When the camber tolerances shown in the above table are not 
suitable for a particular purpose, hot-rolled strip is sometimes 
machine straightened. 
8 For strip less than 8 ft tolerances are to be established in each 
instance. A formula for calculating camber is as follows: 
L 2 X C 1 
64 = C 2 in L 
where: 
C 1 = Camber in 8 ft and 
C 2 = Camber in any given length L

TABLE 9 
FLATNESS TOLERANCES OF HOT-ROLLED STRIP 
(CARBON AND HIGH-STRENGTH LOW-ALLOY) 
It has not been practicable to formulate flatness tolerances 
for hot-rolled carbon strip steel because of the wide range 
of widths and thicknesses, and variety of chemical 
compositions, mechanical properties and types, produced in 
coils and cut lengths.
