ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-372/SA-372M 
treatment as the cylinders it represents. The method of quench­
ing the test ring shall duplicate that of the cylinders; if the 
cylinders aTe quenched from the outside only, then the test ring 
shall have its ends closed. The length of test rings that will be 
liquid quenched shall be at least 24 in. [610 mm]. The ends of 
such test rings may be vented to prevent pressure buildup 
during heat treating. 
6.4.2 Test specimens representing vessel covers or similar 
components may be taken from a full-section prolongation of 
the cover, a representative forging, or an integral prolongation 
when the part is contour machined before heat treatment. 
6.4.2.1 Test specimens taken from full size prolongations or 
representative forgings shall be located at a position midway 
between the center and the surface. 
6.4.2.2 When forgings are contour machined before heat 
treatment so that highly stressed surfaces are exposed, the test 
specimens may be taken at an equal distance (t) from the 
nearest quenched surface as the highly stressed area but not 
less than ¾ in. [20 mm]. The location of the specimens from a 
second surface shall be at least the greater of 1 ½ in. [40 mm] 
or 2t. 
6.5 Number of Tests: 
6.5.1 Up to 200 like forgings, each with a heat-treated 
weight of less than 1000 lb [450 kg] when heat treated in a 
single-batch furnace charge, shall have one tension test taken in 
accordance with 6.4.1 or 6.4.2 to represent each heat. In 
addition, for hollow or bored forgings, one bend or flattening 
test shall be taken in accordance with 6.3. 
6.5.2 Like forgings, weighing less than 1000 lb [450 kg] 
each when heat treated in a continuous furnace, shall have one 
tensile test taken to represent each heat and not more than 200 
forgings in any continuous period up to 4 h duration. In 
addition, bored or hollow forgings shall have one bend or 
flattening test talcen per heat per 200 forgings in any continuous 
period up to 4 h duration in accordance with 6.3. 
6.5.3 For heat-treated forgings weighing 1000 lb [ 450 kg] or 
more, one tension test shall be taken in accordance with 6.4.1 
or 6.4.2 to represent each heat and not more than ten forgings 
in a heat-treat lot. In addition, hollow or bored forgings shall 
have one bend or flattening test, taken in accordance with 6.3, 
to represent each ten or fewer forgings from the same heat and 
heat-treatment lot. 
6.6 Hardness Testing: 
6.6.1 Forgings under 1000 lb [ 450 kg] in weight, heat 
treated in a batch lot of up to 200 pieces (6.5.1) or in a 
continuous furnace run covering up to 200 pieces in up to 4 h 
production (6.5.2) shall be subject to a uniformity check by 
Brinell hardness testing or an equivalent method. For this 
purpose, 10 % of the furnace production shall be sampled and 
shall meet the minimum hardness specified in Table 2 for the 
type and shall also be within 20 Brinell points of the hardness 
of the forging from which the tensile test was taken. 
6.6.2 In the event that the test sample does not meet these 
criteria, the remainder of that production group shall be 
hardness tested and all of those forgings that fall outside these 
limits shall be retempered or reheat-treated at the manufactur­
er's option and retested. 
7. Magnetic Particle Examination 
7.1 All quenched and tempered forgings shall be subject to 
magnetic particle examination after heat treatment. The meth­
ods used shall be in accordance with Practice A275/A275M. 
7.2 Only direct current or rectified alternating (full or half 
wave) current shall be used as the electric power source for any 
of the magnetizing methods. 
7.3 The forgings shall be free from linear indications 
indicative of cracks. In case of doubt as to the type of condition 
giving rise to linear magnetic particle indications, they may be 
inspected for Type II indications referenced in Reference 
Photographs E433 when inspected by the liquid penetrant 
method in accordance with Practice E165/E165M. 
Alternatively, some other suitable method for classifying the 
indications may be used as agreed upon between the manufac­
turer and the purchaser. 
8. Workmanship 
8.1 If the thickness of a portion of the wall of a forging is 
less than that specified, the forgings may be accepted by the 
purchaser, provided that such irregularity will not require 
lowering the allowable working pressure below that for which 
the forging was designed. 
9. Repair Welding 
9.1 Repair welding shall be permitted when mutually agreed 
upon between the purchaser and the manufacturer and shall be 
performed in accordance with all the requirements of the 
applicable code or rules of construction.
