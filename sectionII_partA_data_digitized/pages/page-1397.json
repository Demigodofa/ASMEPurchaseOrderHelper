Heat Treatment \n6.1 Unless otherwise stated herein, heat treatment shall be \nperformed after welding and in accordance with the require\u00ad\nments of Table 2. \n6.1.1 No final heat treatment of welded fittings (HT-O) \nfabricated from ferritic/austenitic plate that has been heat \ntreated as required by Table 2 for the particular grade, is \nrequired, provided material representative of the fittings, in\u00ad\ncluding base metal, weld metal, and heat affected zone, passes \na Test Methods A923 Method B or C (See Note 1) corrosion \nevaluation per heat. Each fitting supplied under this require\u00ad\nment shall be stenciled with the suffix HT-O. \n6.1.2 For materials not listed in Table 3 of Test Methods \nA923, the HT-O provision does not apply. \nNoTE 1-The Test Methods A923 test method (B or C) is at the \nmanufacturer's option, unless otherwise specified by the purchaser. \n6.2 All fittings machined directly from forgings or bars (see \n5.12), previously heat treated in accordance with the require\u00ad\nments specified in Table 2, need not be reheat treated. \n7. Chemical Composition \n7 .1 The chemical composition of each cast or heat shall be \ndetennined and shall conform to the requirements of the \nchemical composition for the respective grades of materials \nlisted in Table 1. Metl1ods and practices relating to chemical \nanalyses required by this specification shall be in accordance \nwith Methods, Practices, and Definitions A751. Product analy\u00ad\nsis tolerances in accordance with Specification A960/ A960M \nare applicable. \n7 .2 Except as listed below, in fittings of welded construc\u00ad\ntion, the composition of the deposited weld shall conform to \nthe same requirements as the base metal. \n7.2.1 Welds on S32950 base metal shall be made with \nnominal 26 % Cr, 8 % Ni, 2 % Mo weld metal. \n7.2.2 Welds on S31803 base metal shall conform to the \nsame requirements as the base metal or shall be made with \nnominal 22 % Cr, 9 % Ni, 3 % Mo weld metal. \n7.2.3 Welds on S32202 base metal shall be made with \nnmninal 22 % Cr, 9 % Ni, 3 % Mo weld metal. \n8. Tensile Requirements \n8.1 The tensile properties of the fitting material shall con\u00ad\nform to the requirements of Table 3. The testing and reporting \nshall be performed in accordance with Specification A960/ \nA960M. \n8.2 The fittings manufacturer shall perform a tensile test on \nmaterial representative of the finished fitting.
