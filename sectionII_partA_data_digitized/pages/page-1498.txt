DETAILS OF TEST COUPON DESIGN FOR CASTING (SEE FIG. 2) 
Leg Design [125 mm] 
A 5 in. [125 mm] minimum length will be 
used. This length may be increased at 
the option of the foundry to accommo­
date additional test bars (see Note 1). 
Use of and size of end taper is at the 
option of the foundry. 
11/ 4 in. [32 mmJ 
1 ¼ in. [32 mmJ (see Note 1). 
1/ 2 in. [13 mmJ, max 
A ½ in. [13 mm] radius will be used 
between the legs. 
The tensile, bend, and impact bars will be 
taken from the lower portion of the leg 
(see Note 2). 
The number of legs attached to the cou­
pon is at the option of the foundry pro­
viding they are equispaced according to 
item 6.

Riser Design 
The length of the riser at the base wi 11 
be the same as the top length of the 
leg. The length of the riser at the top 
therefore depends on the amount of 
taper added to the riser. 
The width of the riser at the base of a 
multiple-leg coupon shall be n, 2¼ 
[57 mm] - % [16 mm] where n 
equals the number of legs attached to 
the coupon. The width of the riser at 
the top is therefore dependent on the 
amount of taper added to the riser. 
Use of and size is at the option of the 
foundry. 
The minimum height of the riser shall be 
2 in. [51 mmJ. The maximum height 
is at the option of the foundry for the 
following reasons: Cal Many risers are 
cast open, (bl different compositions 
may require variation in risering for 
soundness, (cl different pouring tem­
peratures may require variation in ris­
ering for soundness. 
NOTE 1 - Test Coupons for Large and Heavy Steel Castings: The test coupons in Fig. 2 are to be used for large and heavy steel castings. 
However, at the option of the foundry the cross-sectional area and length of the standard coupon may be increased as desired. 
NOTE 2 - Bend Bar: If a bend bar is required, an alternate design (as shown by dotted lines in Fig. 2) is indicated.
