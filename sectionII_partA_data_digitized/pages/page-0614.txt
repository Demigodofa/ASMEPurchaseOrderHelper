effective it is essential that secondary processors, distributors, 
and purchasers maintain the identification and integrity of each 
lot until the product is installed. 
9.3 Lot Processing-All fasteners shall be processed in 
accordance with a lot identification-control quality assurance 
plan. The manufacturer, secondary processors, and distributors 
shall identify and maintain the integrity of each lot of fasteners 
from raw-material selection through all processing operations 
and treatments to final packing and shipment. Each lot shall be 
assigned its own lot-identification number, each lot shall be 
tested, and the inspection test reports for each lot shall be 
retained. 
9.4 Lot Definition-A lot is a quantity of a uniquely identi­
fied fastener product of the same nominal size and length 
produced consecutively at the initial operation from a single 
mill heat of material and heat treatment lot and processed at 
one time, by the same process, in the same manner so that 
statistical sampling is valid. The identity of the lot is main­
tained throughout all subsequent operations and packaging. 
9 .5 Number of Tests~ The minimum number of tests from 
each production lot for the tests specified below shall be in 
accordance with Guide F1470. 
Hardness 
Tensile 
Proof Load 
Coating Weight/Thickness 
Workmanship (Surface 
Discontinuities Section 8) 
9.5.1 The number of tests for dimensional and thread fit 
compliance shall be in accordance with the quality assurance 
provisions of the referenced dimensional standards. 
9.6 If any test specimen shows defective machining it may 
be discarded and another specimen substituted. 
10. Test Methods 
10.1 Test methods shall be conducted in accordance with 
Test Methods F606. 
10.2 Proof load, rather than yield strength determination is 
preferred and shall be the arbitration method for fasteners 1 ¼ 
in. and under in diameter. 
10.3 Hexagon bolts shall be tested by the wedge tension 
method. Fracture shall be in the body or threads of the bolt 
without any fracture at the junction of the head and body. 
10.3.1 At the option of the manufacturer, the yield strength 
test (Method 2, Yield Strength paragraph of Test Methods 
F606) and the wedge tension test (Wedge Tension Testing of 
Full-Size Product paragraph, both from the Test Method 
section of Test Methods F606) may be accomplished concur- "-
rently to satisfy 10.2 and 10.3. 
10.4 Studs and bolts other than those in 10.3 shall be tested 
by the axial tension method. 
10.4.1 At the option of the manufacturer, the yield strength 
test and the axial tension test may be accomplished concur­
rently to satisfy 10.2 and 10.4. 
10.5 The speed of testing determined with a free running 
crosshead shall be a maximum of 1/s in. (3.2 mm)/min for the 
bolt proof load (or yield strength) determination and a maxi­
mum of 1 in. (25.4 mm)/min for the tensile strength determi­
nation. 
11. Inspection 
11.1 If the inspection described in 11.2 is required by the 
purchaser, it shall be specified in the inquiry and contract or 
purchase order. 
11.2 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
free entry to all parts of the manufacturer's works that concern 
the manufacture of the material ordered. The manufacturer 
shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities to satisfy him 
that the material is being furnished in accordance with this 
specification. All tests and inspections required by the specifi­
cation that are requested by the purchaser's representative shall 
be made before shipment, and shall be conducted as not to 
interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the works. 
12. Responsibility 
12.1 The party responsible for the fastener shall be the 
organization that supplies the fastener to the purchaser. 
13. Rejection and Rehearing 
13.l Material that fails to conform to the requirements of 
this specification may be rejected. Rejection should be reported 
to the producer or supplier promptly and in writing. In case of 
dissatisfaction with the results of the test, the producer or 
supplier may make claim for a rehearing. 
562 
14. Certification 
14.1 When specified on the purchase order, the manufac­
turer or supplier, whichever is the responsible party in accor­
dance with Section 12, shall furnish the purchaser a test report 
which includes the following: 
14.1.1 Product description, grade, quantity, ASTM Specifi­
cation Number and issue date, 
14.1.2 Alloy grade (AlSI, SAE, UNS, etc.), heat analysis, 
and heat number, and type of quench, 
14.1.3 Results of hardness, tensile, and proof load tests, as 
applicable, 
14.1.4 Statement of compliance to Protective Coating 
Specification (if applicable), 
14.1.5 Statement of compliance with the surface disconti­
nuity requirements of Specification F788/F788M, 
14.1.6 Statement of compliance dimensionally, 
14.1.7 Report, describe, or illustrate manufacturer's mark­
ings and their location, 
14.1.8 Lot number, purchase order number, and date 
shipped,
