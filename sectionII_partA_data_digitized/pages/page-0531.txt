and purchasers maintain the identification and integrity of each 
lot until the product is installed. 
9.3 Lot Method-All bolts shall be processed in accordance 
with a lot identification-control quality assurance plan. The 
manufacturer, secondary processors, and distributors shall 
identify and maintain the integrity of each production lot of 
bolts from raw-material selection through all processing op­
erations and treatments to final packing and shipment. Each lot 
shall be assigned its own lot-identification number, each lot 
shall be tested, and the inspection test reports for each lot shall 
be retained. 
9.4 Lot Definition-A lot shall be a quantity of uniquely 
identified heavy hex structural bolts of the same nominal size 
and length produced consecutively at the initial operation from 
a single mill heat of material and processed at one time, by the 
same process, in the same manner so that statistical sampling is 
valid. The identity of the lot and lot integrity shall be 
maintained throughout all subsequent operations and packag­
ing. 
9.5 Number of Tests-The minimum number of tests from 
each lot for the tests specified below shall be as follows: 
Tests 
Hardness, tensile 
strength, proof load, 
and rotational capacity 
Coating weight/ 
thickness 
Surface discontinuities 
Dimensions and 
thread fit

frequency. 
10. Test Methods 
10.1 Tensile, Proof Load, and Hardness: 
10.1.1 Tensile, proof load, and hardness tests shall be 
conducted in accordance with Test Methods F606. 
10.1.2 Tensile strength shall be determined using the Wedge 
or Axial Tension Testing Method of Full Size Product Method 
or the Machined Test Specimens Method depending on size 
and nominal length as specified in 6.2.1-6.2.2. Fracture on 
full-size tests shall be in the body or threads of the bolt without 
a fracture at the junction of the head and body. 
10.1.3 Proof load shall be determined using Method 1, 
Length Measurement, or Method 2, Yield Strength, at the 
option of the manufacturer. 
10.2 Rotational Capacity-The zinc-coated bolt shall be 
placed in a steel joint or tension measuring device and 
assembled with a zinc-coated washer and a zinc-coated and 
lubricated nut with which the bolt is intended to be used (see 
Note 4). The nut shall have been provided with the lubricant 
described in the last paragraph of the Manufacturing Processes 
section of Specification A563. The joint shall be one or more 
flat structural steel plates or fixture stack up with a total 
thickness, including the washer, such that 3 to 5 full threads of 
the bolt are located between the bearing surfaces of the bolt 
head and nut. The hole in the joint shall have the same nominal 
diameter as the hole in the washer. The initial tightening of the 
nut shall produce a load in the bolt not less than 10 % of the 
specified proof load. After initial tightening, the nut position 
shall be marked relative to the bolt, and the rotation shown in 
Table 6 shall be applied. During rotation, the bolt head shall be 
restrained from turning. After the tightening rotation has been 
applied, the assembly shall be taken apart and examined for 
compliance with 6.3.3. 
479 
NoTE 4-Rotational capacity tests shall apply only to matched assem­
bly lots that contain one A325 bolt, one A563 lubricated nut, and one F436 
washer that have been zinc coated in accordance with either Specifications 
F2329 or B695. Both the bolt and nut components of the matched 
assembly shall be zinc coated using the same process. 
11. Inspection 
11.1 If the inspection described in 11.2 is required by the 
purchaser, it shall be specified in the inquiry and contract or 
order. 
11.2 The purchaser's representative shall have free entry to 
all parts of the manufacturer's works, or supplier's place of 
business, that concern the manufacture or supply of the 
material ordered. The manufacturer or supplier shall afford the 
purchaser's representative all reasonable facilities to satisfy 
him that the material is being furnished in accordance with this 
specification. All tests and inspections required by the specifi­
cation that are requested by the purchaser's representative shall 
be made before shipment, and shall be conducted as not to
