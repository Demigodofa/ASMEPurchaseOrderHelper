SA-403/SA-403M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
(pipe, tube, plate, bar, and forgings) normally used in the 
manufacturing of fittings to this specification. Methods and 
practices relating to chemical analyses required by this speci­
fication shall be in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, 
and Terminology A751. Product analysis tolerances in accor­
dance with Specification A960/A960M are applicable. 
7 .2 The steel shall not contain any unspecified elements for 
the ordered grade to the extent that it conforms to the 
requirements of another grade for which that element is a 
specified element having a required minimum content. 
7.3 In fittings of welded construction, the alloy content 
(carbon, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, niobium 
(columbium), and tantalum) of the deposited weld metal shall 
conform to that required of the base metal or for equivalent 
weld metal as given in the AWS filler metal specification A 5.4 
or A 5.9 (Type 348 weld metal is listed in AWS A 5.9 but not 
in AWS A 5.4). Exceptions are when welding on Types 304L 
and 304 base metals, the deposited weld metal shall 
correspond, respectively, to AWS E308L (ER308L) and E308 
(ER308). When welding 3 lOS or 310H, the weld metal shall 
correspond to A WS ER310 unless otherwise advised by the 
purchaser at the time of placement on the purchase order. When 
welding on Type 321 base metal, the weld metal shall 
correspond to AWS Type E347 (ER347 or ER321); and, when 
welding on S31725, S31726, S31254, S31266, or S33228 
deposited weld metal shall correspond either to the alloy 
content of the base metal or to AWS AS .11 E NiCrMo-3 (UNS 
W86112) (AWS AS.14 Ni Cr Mo-3 (UNS N06625)), and when 
welding on S3 l 730, deposited weld metal and filler metal used 
shall cmTespond either to the alloy content of the base metal or 
to AWS AS.14 ERNiCr-3 (UNS N06082), or ERNiCrMo-3 
(UNS N06625), or ERNiCrMo-4 (UNS N10276). On S38815 
base metals, the deposited weld metal and filler metal used 
shall be agreed upon between purchaser and manufacturer. In 
fittings of welded construction made from predominantly 
fe1rnus alloys N08020, N08367, N08700, N08800, N08810, 
N08811, N08904, N08925 & N08926, the alloy content of the 
deposited weld metal shall conform to that required of the base 
metal or for the equivalent weld metal given in the AWS Filler 
Metal Specification AS.11 and AS.14. However, it is possible 
that weld deposit chemistry will not meet the limits of either 
the base metal or the filler metal for some elements. The weld 
deposit chemistry shall meet the lowest minimum and highest 
maximum values for each specification element in either of the 
base metal or filler metal specification. Dilution of the base and 
filler metal must be considered when determining weld deposit 
criteria for over-alloyed filler metals. 
7.3.1 Supplementary Requirement SI may be specified 
where 16-8-2 filler metal is required for joining thick sections 
of Types 316, 321, or 347 and has adequate corrosion resis­
tance for the intended service. 
8. Tensile Properties 
8.1 The tensile properties of the fitting material shall con­
form to the requirements of Table 5. The testing and reporting 
shall be performed in accordance with Specification A960/ 
A960M.

8.1.1 Specimens cut either longitudinally or transversely 
shall be acceptable for the tensile test. 
8.1.2 While Table 5 specifies elongation requirements for 
both longitudinal and transverse specimens, it is not the intent 
that both requirements apply simultaneously. Instead, it is 
intended that only the elongation requirement that is appropri­
ate for tl1e specimen used be applicable. 
8.2 Records of the tension test made on the starting material 
shall be certification that the material of the fitting meets the 
requirements of this specification provided that heat treatments 
are the same. 
8.3 If the raw material was not tested, or if the heat 
treatment of the raw material was different than the heat 
treatment of the fitting, the fitting manufacturer shall perform 
at least one tension test per heat on material representative of 
the fitting, and in the same condition of heat treatment as the 
fitting it represents. Qualification of welding procedures shall 
be in accordance with 5.8. 
8.4 If a tension test through the weld is desired, Supplemen­
tary Requirement S51 in Specification A960/A960M should be 
specified.
