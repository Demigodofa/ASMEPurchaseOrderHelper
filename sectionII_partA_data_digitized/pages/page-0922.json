For angles over 6 lb/ft [9 kg/m], the weight tolerance shall not exceed \n\u00b14\u00bd%. \nLength of Legs \nFor angles having legs or flanges up to 6 in. [150 mm], incl, the length toler\u00ad\nance shall not exceed \u00b1 1/s in. [3.00 mm]. For angles having legs or flanges over \n6 in., the length tolerance shall not exceed + 3/ta in. [5.00 mm] and-\u00bc in. \nSquareness of Legs \nThe tolerance for the right angle between the legs is \u00b12\u00b0. \nA For equal leg angles, the theoretical weight per foot is: \nweighVfoot = (24 W x t - 12t 2 ) (0.2871 lb/ft) \nwhere: \nW specified length of the leg, in inches, and \nt specified thickness, in inches. \nFor unequal leg angles, the theoretical weight per foot is: \nweighVfoot = [12 W1 x t+ 12 111,2 x t-12t 2 ] (0.2871 lb/ft) \nwhere: \nW1 and W2 \nt \nspecified leg lengths, in inches, and \nspecified leg thickness, in inches. \nbars and shapes and from each lot of forgings. Except for bars \ncut from strip or plate, tension tests of bars and shapes shall be \nmade in the longitudinal direction or, at the manufacturer's \noption unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, in the \ntransverse (through thickness) direction. Material tensile tested \nin the transverse direction and meeting the specified tensile \nproperty requirements need not be tested in the longitudinal \ndirection. Testing for bars cut from strip or plate shall conform \nto the requirements of the applicable product specification for \nthe strip or plate and to Specification A480/A480M. Hardness \ntests on bars shall be conducted midway between the center \nand surface of the product. Tension tests on forgings shall be \nprepared from suitable prolongations, or at the option of the \nsupplier, excess forgings may be provided for test. All tests \nshall conform to the chemical and mechanical requirements of \nthe product specification. \n822 \n12.2 One intergranular corrosion test, when required, and \none grain size test, when required shall be made on each lot. \nOften, it is convenient to obtain test material from the \nspecimen selected for mechanical testing. \n,,,.,.---...
