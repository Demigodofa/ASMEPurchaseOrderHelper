ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA·414/SA-414M 
4.1.1 Designation or specification number, date of issue, and 
grade, 
4.1.1.1 Grade H may be substituted for Grade G upon 
agreement between the purchaser and producer, 
4.1.2 Copper bearing steel, when required, 
4.1.3 Special requirements, if required, 
4.1.3.1 Charpy impact properties may be specified for 
Grade H at the time of order, 
4.1.3.2 Strength levels at other than room temperature may 
be specified for Grade H at the time of order, 
4.1.4 Condition-pickled (or blast cleaned), if required 
(material so ordered will be oiled unless ordered dry), and 
4.1.5 Dimensions, including type of edges. 
4.1.5 .1 When the purchaser requires thickness tolerances for 
3t8 in. [10 mm] minimum edge distance (see Supplementary 
Requirement in Specifications A568/A568M or A635/A635M, 
as applicable), this requirement shall be specified in the 
purchase order or contract. 
Norn 1-Not all producers are capable of meeting all of the limitations 
of the thickness tolerance tables in Specification A568/A568M or Speci­
fication A635/A635M. The purchaser should contact the producer regard­
ing possible limitations prior to placing an order. 
4.1.6 Cast or heat analysis, or test report request, or both, if 
required. 
Norn 2-A typical ordering description is as follows: "ASTM A414, 
Grade A, Hot-Rolled Sheet, 0.100 in. [2.54 mm] by 36 in. [914.4 mm] by 
96 in. [2438 mm], cut edges." 
5. Chemical Requirements 
5.1 Cast or Heat Analysis-The analysis of the steel shall 
conform to the requirements prescribed in Table 1. 
5 .1.1 Each of the elements listed in Table 2 shall be included 
in the report of the heat analysis. When the amount of an 
element present is less than 0.02 %, the analysis may be 
reported as "<0.02 %." 
TABLE 2 Limits on Unspecified Elements (See 5.1.1) 
Copper, max %A Heat analysis 0.40 
Product analysis 0.43 
Nickel, max %A Heat analysis 0.40 
Product analysis 0.43 
Chromium, max %A.a Heat analysis 0.30 
Product analysis 0.34 
Molybdenum, max %A.a Heat analysis 0.12 
Product analysis 0.13 
Vanadium, max %c Heat analysis 0.03 
Product analysis 0.04 
Columbium, max %c Heat analysis 0.02 
Product analysis 0.03 
A The sum of copper, nickel, chromium, and molybdenum shall not exceed 1.00 % 
on heat analysis. When one or more of these elements are specified, the sum does 
not apply, in which case, only the individual limits on the remaining unspecified 
elements will apply. 
a The sum of chromium and molybdenum shall not exceed 0.32 % on heat 
analysis. When one or more of these elements are specified, the sum does not 
apply, in which case, only the individual limits on the remaining unspecified 
elements will apply. 
c By agreement, the heat analysis limits for vanadium or columbium, or both, may 
be increased up to 0.1 O % and 0.05 %, respectively. 
5.2 Product, Check, or Verification Analysis-Analyses may 
be made by the purchaser from finished material representing 
each heat. 
5.3 Deoxidation-For all grades, killed steel is required. 
See Table 1 and footnote B. 
6. Mechanical Property Reqnirements 
6.1 Tensile Strength: 
6.1.1 Requirements-Material as represented by the test 
specimen shall conform to the tensile requirements specified in 
Table 3. One coil per lot shall have test specimens taken from 
locations representing the front end, middle, and back end of 
the coil. If all tensile results conform to the requirements, other 
coils of that lot may be tested only at the middle position. 
6.1.2 Location and Orientation (see Fig. 1):

A For each reduction of 0.01 % below the specified carbon maximum, an increase of 0.06 % manganese above the specified maximum wll be permitted up to a maximum 
of 1.50 %. 
a The steel shall be considered aluminum-silicon killed when the silicon is between 0.15 % and 0.30 %, otherwise it shall be considered aluminum killed. 
c When copper is specified, a minimum of 0.20 % is required. When copper is not specified, the copper limit is a maximum requirement. 
0 The sum of copper, nickel, chromium, and molybdenum shall not exceed 1.00 % on heat analysis. When one or more of these elements are specified, the sum does 
not apply, in which case, only the individual limits on the remaining unspecified elements will apply.

G Grade H contains the strengthening elements columbium (niobium), vanadium, titanium and molybdenum added singly or in combination. The minimum requirements 
only apply to the microalloy elements selected for strengthening of the steel.
