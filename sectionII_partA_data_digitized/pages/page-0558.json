A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers nominal wall and minimum \nwall seamless ferritic alloy-steel pipe intended for high\u00ad\ntemperature service. Pipe ordered to this specification shall be \nsuitable for bending, flanging (vanstoning), and similar form\u00ad\ning operations, and for fusion welding. Selection will depend \nupon design, service conditions, mechanical properties, and \nhigh-temperature characteristics. \n1.2 Several grades offerritic steels (see Note 1) are covered. \nTheir compositions are given in Table 1. \nNorn 1-Ferritic steels in this specification are defined as low- and \nintermediate-alloy steels containing up to and including 10 % chromium. \n1.3 Supplementary requirements (Sl to S9) of an optional \nnature are provided. Supplementary requirements S 1 through \nS6 call for additional tests to be made, and when desired, shall \nbe so stated in the order together with the number of such tests \nrequired as applicable. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \nNorn 2-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has \nbeen substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as \"nominal \ndiameter,\" \"size,\" and \"nominal size.\" \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO 1 on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.10 on Stainless and Alloy Steel Tubular Products. \nCurrent edition approved April 1, 2024. Published April 2024. Originally \napproved in 1951. Last previous edition approved in 2023 as A335/A335M - 23. \nDOI: 10.1520/A0335_A0335M-24. \n2 For ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code applications see related Specifi\u00ad\ncation SA-335 in Section II of that Code. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
