Terminology \n3.1 Terminology A941 is applicable to this specification. \nAdditional terms and wording more applicable to forgings are \nas noted in this section. \n3.2 Forging Definitions: \n3.2.1 steel forging, n-the product of a substantially com\u00ad\npressive plastic working operation that consolidates the mate\u00ad\nrial and produces the desired shape. The plastic working may \nbe performed by a hammer, press, forging machine, or ring \nrolling machine, and must deform the material to produce an \nessentially wrought structure. \n3.2.1.1 Discussion-Hot rolling operations may be used to \nproduce blooms or billets for reforging. \n3.3 Forging Geometries: \n3.3.1 bar forging, n-forging that has no bore and having an \naxial length greater than its maximum cross sectional dimen\u00ad\nsion. \n3.3.1.1 Discussion-More than one cross sectional shape or \nsize may be included. Sometimes referred to as a solid forging. \n3.3.2 disk forging, n-forging, sometimes referred to as a \npancake forging, that has (a) an axial length appreciably less \nthan its diameter, (b) may be dished on one or both faces, and \n( c) final forging includes upsetting operations to reduce the \nheight of the stock and increase its diameter. \n3.3.2.1 Discussion-Since much of the hot working is done \nin axially compressing the stock, the central area may not \nreceive sufficient consolidation. To counter this effect, consid\u00ad\neration is usually given to the initial saddening (see 3.3.6) of \nthe ingot or billet. \n3.3.3 hollow forging, n-forging (also known as a shell \nforging or a mandrel forging) in which (a) the axial length is \nequal to or greater than the diameter, and (b) the forging length \nand wall thickness are produced by hot working over a mandrel \n(usually water cooled) such that the bore diameter remains \nessentially the same as that of the mandrel. \n3.3.3.1 Discussion-Unless a hollow ingot has been used, \nthe starting slug is hot trepanned or punched after upsetting and \nthe bore diameter adjusted to suit the forging mandrel. The \noutside diameter may be contoured if required. The workpiece \nis forged between the upper die and lower dies while the \nmandrel is supported by cranes or manipulators to facilitate \nrotation. \n3.3.4 ring forging, n-type of hollow forging in which (a) \nthe axial length is less than the diameter, (b) the wall thickness \nis reduced, and ( c) the outside diameter is increased by hot \nworking between the top die and a mandrel supported on \ntemporary saddles. \n3.3.4.1 Discussion-Forging between the top die and the \nmandrel enables the ring diameter to be increased while \nreducing the wall thickness, without increasing the axial \nlength. \n3.3.5 ring rolling, n-involves the use of specialized equip\u00ad\nment whereby a hot punched, trepanned, or bored disk is ( a) \nhot worked between a powered outer roller and an idling inner \nroller, such that the wall thickness is reduced and the outside \ndiameter is increased, and (b) the axial length of the ring is not \n1274 ",
