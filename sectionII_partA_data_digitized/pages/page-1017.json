Product Analysis \nS 1.1 Product analysis shall be made on each bar, seamless \ntube, bored bar, or the parent bar from which forged hollows \nare made. Individual pieces failing to conform to Table 1 shall \nbe rejected. \nS2. Macroetch Test \nS2. l The material shall be macroetch tested and shall meet \nthe quality and cleanliness requirements as specified by the \npurchaser. The macroetch examination may be made on \nrepresentative billets from which the material will be produced \nor it may be made on samples cut from the ends of the bars, \nseamless tubes, bored bars, or forged hollows. The samples \nshall be prepared in accordance with the procedure described in \nMethod E381. \nNoTE S2.1-The quality and cleanliness may be specified by the \npurchaser as equal to or better than that indicated by a designated Jetter \nand plate number of Military Standard-430 (latest revision). \nS3. Ultrasonic Test \nS3.l Each length shall be ultrasonically inspected in a \nmanner agreeable to the purchaser and supplier. \nS4. Demonstration of Capability \nS4.1 When annealed bolting material is ordered to 6.1, a \nsample piece in length at least 3 x diameter D of a represen\u00ad\ntative bar shall be heat treated in accordance with 6.2 and 6.3. \nMechanical test samples taken as required by Section 15 shall \nmeet the requirements of 8.2 and 10.2. \nS5. Fracture Transition Temperature \nS5.1 The fracture transition temperature for a 50 % fibrous \n(ductile shear) fracture shall be determined. The procedure for \ndetermination of the fracture transition temperature shall be to \nprepare four sets (three to a set) of Charpy V-notch specimens \nin accordance with Section 15. One set of three specimens shall \nbe tested at approximately 70 \u00b0F [20 \u00b0C]. The absorbed energy \nin foot-pounds shall be recorded and the percent of fibrous \nfracture determined from Table S5.1 and Fig. S5.l. The other \nthree sets shall be tested at successively lower or higher \ntemperatures to bracket the temperature where the bolting \nmaterial will exhibit a 50 % fibrous fracture. The results of all \ntest data are to be reported to the purchaser. \nS6. Magnetic Particle Inspection \nS6.1 Bolting material may be supplied to cleanliness re\u00ad\nquirements by agreement between the purchaser and supplier. \nThe cleanliness shall be determined by the magnetic particle \nmethod described in the latest issue of Practice E45. \nNoTE S6.1-The bolting material shall have the minimum stock \nremoval specified in Table S6.1 prior to magnetic particle inspection. \nS7. Elevated Temperature Test \nS7.1 Three Charpy V-notch specimens shall be tested at \n212 \u00b0F [100 \u00b0C] to determine the ''upper shelf' fracture energy \nof the material. No specimen thus tested shall break at an \nenergy less than 30 ft-lbf [41 J]. \nS8. Alternative Fracture Toughness Requirement \nS8.1 The fracture toughness requirements (Charpy impact \ntest) for bolting material of the ASME Boiler and Pressure \nVessel Code, Section III, Subarticle NB 2300, shall be used \ninstead of the Charpy impact test requirement specified in \nTABLE S5.1 Percent Fibrous FractureA \nDimension.A Width, mm \n1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 \nDimension B \nHeight, mm \n1.0 98 98 97 96 96 95 94 94 93 93 92 91 91 90 89 89 88 87 \n1.5 97 96 95 94 93 93 92 91 90 89 88 87 86 85 85 83 82 81 \n2.0 96 95 94 93 91 90 89 88 86 85 84 82 81 80 79 78 76 75 \n2.5 95 94 92 91 89 87 86 84 83 81 80 79 76 75 73 72 70 69 \n3.0 94 93 91 90 87 85 83 81 79 78 76 74 72 70 68 66 64 63 \n3.5 93 91 89 87 85 83 80 78 75 74 72 69 67 65 63 61 58 56 \n4.0 93 90 87 85 83 80 78 75 72 70 68 65 62 60 57 55 52 50 \n4.5 92 89 86 83 80 78 75 72 69 66 63 61 58 55 52 49 46 43 \n5.0 91 88 84 81 78 75 72 69 66 63 59 56 53 50 48 44 40 38 \n5.5 90 86 83 79 75 72 69 66 63 59 55 52 48 45 42 38 35 31 \n6.0 89 85 81 78 74 70 66 63 59 55 51 47 44 40 36 33 29 25 \n6.5 88 84 80 76 72 68 63 59 55 51 47 43 40 35 31 27 23 19 \n7.0 87 82 79 74 69 65 61 56 52 47 43 39 34 30 26 21 16 12 \n7.5 86 81 76 72 67 62 58 53 48 44 40 34 30 25 23 16 11 6 \n8.0 85 80 75 70 65 70 55 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 \nA See Fig. S5.1. \n917 ",
