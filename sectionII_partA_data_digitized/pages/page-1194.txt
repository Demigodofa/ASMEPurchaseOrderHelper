SA-671/SA-671M (ASTM A671/A671M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
S14. Description of Term 
S14.1 lot-all pipe of the same mill heat of plate material 
and wall thickness (within±¼ in. [6 mm]) heat treated in one 
furnace charge. For pipe that is not heat treated or that is heat 
treated in a continuous furnace, a lot shall consist of each 200 
ft [60 m] or fraction thereof of all pipe of the same mill heat of 
plate material and wall thickness (within ± ¼ in. [6 mm]), 
subjected to the same heat treatment. For pipe heat treated in a 
batch-type furnace that is automatically controlled within a 50 
°F [30 °C] range and is equipped with recording pyrometers so 
that heating records are available, a lot shall be defined the 
same as for continuous furnaces. 
S15. ASME Section III Construction 
S15.1 Products furnished under this specification that are 
intended for application under the rules of Section ill of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code shall be manufactured 
by holders of the appropriate ASME Certificate of Authoriza­
tion and Certification Mark. The product is subject to all 
applicable requirements of Section ill, including welding, heat 
treatment, nondestructive examination, authorized inspection 
at the point of manufacture, and application of the Certification 
Mark. 
S15.2 The applicable ASME Partial Data Report form, 
signed by an Authorized Nuclear Inspector, and a material test 
report shall be furnished for each lot of pipe. 
S15.3 The plate used to fabricate the pipe shall conform to 
the applicable SA specification in ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code, Section II. The welded joints shall be full 
penetration butt welds as obtained by double welding or by 
other means that will obtain the same quality of deposited weld 
metal on the inside and outside. Welds using metal backing 
strips that remain in place are prohibited. 
S15.4 In addition to the requirements of S14 and Section 13 
Product Marking, each length of pipe shall be so marked as to 
identify each such piece of pipe with the lot and the material 
test report.
