Heat Treatment \n5.1 After welding, all tubes shall be heat treated at a \ntemperature of 1650\u00b0F [900\u00b0C] or higher and followed by \ncooling in air or in the cooling chamber of a controlled\u00ad\natmosphere furnace. Cold-drawn tubes shall be heat treated \nafter the final cold-draw pass at a temperature of 1200\u00b0F \n[650\u00b0C] or higher. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to \nchemical composition prescribed in Table 1. \n6.2 When a grade is ordered under this specification, sup\u00ad\nplying an alloy grade that specifically requires the addition of \nany element other than those listed in Table 1 is not permitted. \n7. Product Analysis \n7.1 When requested on the purchase order, a product analy\u00ad\nsis shall be made by the manufacturer or supplier from one tube \nper 100 pieces for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm] and one tube per \n250 pieces for sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under; or when tubes \nare identified by heat, one tube per heat shall be analyzed. The \nchemical composition thus determined shall conform to the \nrequirements specified. \n7 .2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of \ntwo additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be \nmade. Both retests, for the elements in question, shall meet the \nrequirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining \nmaterial in the heat or lot (Note 2) shall be rejected or, at the \noption of the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or tube \nmay be individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat-\nrolled stock or tubes which do not meet the requirements of the \nspecifications shall be rejected. \nNOTE 2-A lot consists of 250 tubes for sizes 3 in. [76.2 mm] and under \nand of 100 tubes for sizes over 3 in. [76.2 mm], prior to cutting to length. \n8. General Requirements \n8.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con\u00ad\nform to the applicable requirements of the current edition of \nSpecification A450/A450M unless otherwise provided herein. \n9. Tensile Requirements \n9.1 Grade C and D tubes shall conform to the requirements \nas to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. \nNom 3-Explanatory Note-For purposes of design the following \ntensile properties may be assumed for Grade A tubes: \nTensile strength, min, ksi [MPa] 47 [325] \nYield Strength, min, ksl [MPa] 26 [180] \nElongation In 2 in. or 50 mm, min, % 35 \n9.2 Table 3 gives the computed minimum elongation values \nfor each 1/32-in. [0.8 mm] decrease in wall thickness. Where the \nwall thickness lies between two values shown above, the \nminimum elongation value shall be determined by the follow\u00ad\ning equation: \nE = 48t+ 15.00[E = l.87t+ 15.00] \nwhere: \nE = elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm,%, and, \n= actual thickness of specimen, in. [mm]. \n10. Crush Test \n10.1 When required by the purchaser, crushing tests shall be \nmade on sections of tube 2\u00bd in. [63 mm] in length which shall \nstand crushing longitudinally without cracking, splitting, or \nopening at the weld, as follows: \nWall Thickness of \nTubes, In. [mm] \nHeight of Crushed Section, in. [mm] \nGrade A Tubes Grade C and D Tubes \n0.135 [3.43] and under % [19] or until outside Crush tests not required \nfolds are in contact \nOver 0.135 [3.43] 1 \u00bc [32] \n10.2 For tubing less than 1 in. [25.4 mm] in outside \ndiameter, the length of the specimen shall be 2\u00bd times the \noutside diameter of the tube. Slight surface checks shall not be \ncause for rejection. \nTABLE 3 Minimum Elongation Values \nWall Thickness Elongation In 2 In. or 50 ----In-. _______ m_m___ mm, min, %A \no/10 (0.312) 8 \n%2 (0.281) 7.2 \n\u00bc (0.250) 6.4 \n7/22 (0.219) 5.6 \n:Y1s (0.188) 4.8 \n%2(0.156) 4 \n1k (0.125) 3.2 \n%2 (0.094) 2.4 \n1/io (0.062) 1.6 \n30 \n29 \n27 \n26 \n24 \n22 \n21 \n20 \n18 \nA Calculated elongation requirements shall be rounded to the nearest whole \nnumber. \n197 ",
