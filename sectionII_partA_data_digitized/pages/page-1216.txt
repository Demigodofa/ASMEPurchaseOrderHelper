SA-691/SA-691M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Carbon and Alloy Steel Pipe, Electric-Fusion-Welded for 
High-Pressure Service at High Temperatures 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers carbon and alloy steel pipe, 
electric-fusion-welded with filler metal added, fabricated from 
pressure-vessel-quality plate of several analyses and strength 
levels and suitable for high-pressure service at high tempera­
tures. Heat treatment may or may not be required to attain the 
desired mechanical properties or to comply with applicable 
code requirements. Supplementary requirements are provided 
for use when additional testing or examination is desired. 
1.2 The specification nominally . covers pipe 16 in. [ 400 
mm] in outside diameter and larger with wall thicknesses up to 
3 in. [75 mm] inclusive. Pipe having other dimensions may be 
furnished provided it complies with all other requirements of 
this specification. 
1.3 Several grades and classes of pipe are provided. 
1.3.1 Grade designates the type of plate used as listed in 
Table 1. 
1.3.2 Class designates the type of heat treatment performed 
in the manufacture of the pipe, whether the weld is radio­
graphically examined, and whether the pipe has been pressure 
tested as listed in 1.3.3. 
1.3.3 Class designations are as follows (Note 1):

NoTE I-Selection of materials should be made with attention to 
temperature of service. For such guidance, Specification A20/ A20M may 
be consulted. 
1 .4 Optional requirements of a supplementary nature are 
provided, calling for additional tests and control of repair 
welding, when desired. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order.
