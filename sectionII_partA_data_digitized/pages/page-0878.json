Scope \n1.1 This specification covers hot- and cold-finished bars of \nstainless steel, including rounds, squares, and hexagons, and \nhot-rolled or extruded shapes such as angles, tees, and channels \nfor use in boiler and pressure vessel construction. 2 \nNom 1-There are standards covering high nickel, chromium, auste\u00ad\nnitic corrosion, and heat-resisting alloy materials. These standards are \nunder the jurisdiction of ASTM Subcommittee B02.07 and may be found \nin Annual Book of ASTM Standards, Vol 02.04. \n1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n1.3 Unless the order specifies the applicable \"M\" specifica\u00ad\ntion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch\u00ad\npound units. \n1.4 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
