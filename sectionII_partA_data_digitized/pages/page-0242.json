Pipe shall not be rounded by hammering in order to get a \nfull thread. There shall be not more than two black threads for \n\u00be-in. [19.0-mm] taper among the perfect threads. Black \nthreads should not be confused with imperfect threads, such as \nthose torn, shaven, or broken. \nNara 6-A complete description of the American National Standard \nPipe Threads applicable to pipe, valves, and fittings is contained in ASME \nB1.20.1; also \"Screw-Thread Standards for Federal Services, 1942,\" \nNational Bureau of Standards Handbook H 28, January, 1942, the perti\u00ad\nnent data in both sources being identical. \n13.3 Couplings-Each length of threaded pipe shall be \nprovided with one coupling manufactured in accordance with \nSpecification A865/ A865M except that the coupling may be \nwrought iron (Note 7). Threads shall be cut so as to make a \ntight joint. Taper-tapped couplings shall be furnished on all \nweights (masses) of threaded pipe NPS 2\u00bd [DN 65] and larger. \nNoTE 7-For sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and smaller, it is commercial \npractice to furnish straight-tapped couplings for standard-weight (mass) \n(Schedule 40) pipe and taper-tapped couplings for extra-strong (Schedule \n80) and double-extra-strong pipe. If taper-tapped couplings are required \nfor sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and smaller on standard weight (mass) (Schedule \n40) pipe, line pipe in accordance with Specification 5L of the American \nPetroleum Institute should be ordered, thread lengths to be in accordance \nwith ASME B 1.20.1. Taper-tapped couplings for sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and \nsmaller in standard weight (mass) may be used on mill-threaded standard \nweight (mass) type of the same size. \n13.4 Protective Coating: \n13.4.1 After the pipe has been subjected to the hydrostatic \ntest, and if required by the purchaser, it shall be thoroughly \ncleaned of all dirt, oil, grease, loose scale, and rust; then dried, \nand given a protective coating of the kind and in the manner \nspecified by the purchaser. Pipe furnished to Schedule 10 shall \nbe normally shipped with a light coating of processing oil. If so \nspecified, the pipe can be given a mill coating or a special \ncoating. \n14. Weld Repair \n14.1 Welding Repair: \n14.2 Defects in the pipe wall, provided their depth does not \nexceed one third the specified wall thickness, shall be repaired \nby electric welding. Defects in the welds such as sweats or \nleaks, unless otherwise specified, shall be repaired or the piece \nrejected at the option of the manufacturer. Repairs of this \nnature shall be made by completely removing the defect, \ncleaning the cavity, and then electric welding. \n14.3 All repaired pipe shall be retested hydrostatically in \naccordance with Section 10. \n15. Sampling \n15.1 Chemical Analysis: \n15.1.1 Samples for chemical analysis shall be taken in \naccordance with Test Method, Practices, and Terminology \nA751. The number of samples shall be determined as follows: \nNPS \nUnder 6 [DN 150] \n6 [DN 150] to 20 [DN \n500], incl \nOver 20 [DN 500] to \n30 [DN 750], incl \n15.2 Tension Test: \nNumbers of Samples Selected \n2 from each lot of 400 pipes or fraction \nthereof \n2 from each lot of 200 pipes or fraction \nthereof \n2 from each lot of 100 pipes or fraction \nthereof \n15.2.1 One longitudinal tension test shall be made on one \nlength (Note 8) from each lot of 400 lengths or fraction thereof \nof each size under NPS 8 [DN 200] and one transverse body \nand one transverse weld tension test on one length from each \nlot of 200 lengths or fraction thereof of each size NPS 8 to NPS \n20 [DN 200 to DN 500] and on one length from each lot of 100 \nlengths or fraction thereof of each size over NPS 20 to NPS 30 \n[DN 500 to DN 750]. When taken from the skelp, the number \nof tests shall be determined in the same manner as when taken \nfrom the finished pipe. \nNoTE 8-Length is defined as the length as ordered, except that in the \ncase of orders for cut lengths shorter than double random, which is defined \nas the length as rolled, prior to cutting to the required short lengths. \n15.3 Flattening Test: \n15 .3 .1 When pipe is produced in single length, the flattening \ntest specified in 9.1 shall be made on both crop ends cut from \neach length of pipe. When pipe is produced in multiple lengths, \nflattening tests are required on the crop ends from the front and \nback ends of each coil and on two intermediate rings repre\u00ad\nsenting each coil. \n15.4 Hydrostatic Test: \n15.4.1 Each length of pipe shall be subjected to the hydro\u00ad\nstatic test specified in Section 10. \n16. Test, Retest, and Resampling \n16.1 Chemical Analysis: \n190 \n16.1.1 If the results of the analysis of either length of pipe \ndoes not conform to the requirements specified in Section 7, \nanalyses of two additional lengths from the same lot shall be \nmade, each of which shall conform to the requirements \nspecified. \n16.2 Tension Test: \n16.2.1 The test specimens and the tests required by this \nspecification shall conform to those described in Test Methods \nand Definitions A370, except that all specimens shall be tested \nat room temperature. \n16.2.2 The longitudinal tension test specimen shall be taken \nfrom the end of the pipe, or by agreement between the \nmanufacturer and the purchaser may be taken from the skelp, \nat a point approximately 90\u00b0 from the weld, and shall not be \nflattened between gauge marks. The sides of each specimen \nshall be parallel between gauge marks. At the manufacturer \noption, the tension test may be made on full section of pipe. \n16.2.3 Transverse weld test specimens shall be taken with \nthe weld at the center of the specimen. Transverse body test \nspecimens shall be taken opposite to the weld. All transverse \ntest specimens shall be approximately 1 \u00bd in. [38 mm] wide in \nthe gauge length and shall represent the full wall thickness of \nthe pipe from which the specimen was cut. ",
