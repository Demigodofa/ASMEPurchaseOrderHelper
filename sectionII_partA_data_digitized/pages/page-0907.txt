A Thickness is measured along the original longitudinal edges of the as-produced 
plate at least 1 0 mm but not more than 75 mm from the edge. 
8 For circles, the over thickness tolerances in this table apply to the diameter of the 
circle corresponding to the width ranges shown. For plates of Irregular shape, the 
over thickness tolerances apply to the greatest width corresponding to the width 
ranges shown. For plates up to 250 mm, incl, in thickness, the tolerance under the 
specified thickness is 0.30 mm. 
c The tolerance over specified thickness In the area more than 75 mm in from the 
longitudinal edges of the plate at the mill produced width shall not exceed twice the 
tabular tolerance.
