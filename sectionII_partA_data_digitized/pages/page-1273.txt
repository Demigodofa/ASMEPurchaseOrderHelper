and then precipitation heat treated at a temperature in the range 
from 1000 to 1300°F [540 to 705°C] for a time to be 
determined by the manufacturer or processor. 
5.2 If the purchaser elects to perform the thermal treatment, 
the plates shall be accepted on the basis of mill tests made from 
test coupons heat treated as specified in the purchase order. If 
the test coupon heat treatment requirements are not specified in 
the purchase order, the manufacturer or processor shall heat 
treat the test coupons under conditions it considers appropriate. 
The manufacturer or processor shall inform the purchaser of 
the procedure followed in thermally treating tpe test coupons at 
the mill. ' 
6. Chemical Composition

7 .1.1 The plates, as represented by the test specimens, shall 
conform to the requirements given in Table 2. 
7.1.2 For nominal plate thicknesses of¾ in. [20 mm] and 
under, the 1 ½-in. [40-mm] wide rectangular test specimen may 
be used for the tension test, and the elongation may be 
determined in a 2-in. [50-mm] gage length that includes the 
fracture and shows the greatest elongation. 
7.2 Notch-Toughness Test: 
7.2.1 Charpy V-notch impact tests shall be made in accor­
dance with Specification A20/ A20M. 
7.2.2 The test results of 10 by 10-mm specimens shall meet 
an average minimum value of20 ft·lbf [27 J] at-50°F [-45°C].
