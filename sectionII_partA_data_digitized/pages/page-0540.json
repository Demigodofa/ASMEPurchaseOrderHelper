Chemical Composition \n5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to \nchemical composition prescribed in Table 1. \n5.2 When Grades 1, 6, or 10 are ordered under this \nspecification, supplying an alloy grade that specifically re\u00ad\nquires the addition of any element other than those listed for \nthe ordered grade in Table l is not permitted. However, the \naddition of elements required for the deoxidation of the steel is \npermitted. \n6. Product Analysis \n6.1 At the request of the purchaser, an analysis of one billet \nor two samples of flat-rolled stock from each heat or of two \npipes from each lot shall be made by the manufacturer. A lot of \npipe shall consist of the following: \nNPS Designator \nUnder 2 \n2 to 6 \nOver 6 \nLength of Pipe in Lot \n400 or fraction thereof \n200 or fraction thereof \n100 or fraction thereof \n6.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the \npurchaser or the purchaser's representative and shall conform \nto the requirements specified. \n6.3 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 6.1 does \nnot conform to the requirements specified, an analysis of each \nbillet or pipe from the same heat or lot may be made, and aH \nbillets or pipe conforming to the requirements shall be ac\u00ad\ncepted. \n7. Tensile Requirements \n7 .1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to \ntensile properties prescribed in Table 2. \n8. Impact Requirements \n8.1 For Grades 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11, the notched-bar \nimpact properties of each set of three impact specimens, \nincluding specimens for the welded joint in welded pipe with \nwall thicknesses of 0.120 in. [3 mm] and larger, when tested at \ntemperatures in conformance with 14.1 shall be not less than \nthe values prescribed in Table 3. \n8.1.1 If the impact value of one specimen is below the \nminimum value, or the impact values of two specimens are less \nthan the minimum average value but not below the minimum \nvalue permitted on a single specimen, a retest shall be allowed. \nThe retest shall consist of breaking three additional specimens \nand each specimen must equal or exceed the required average \nvalue. When an erratic result is caused by a defective \nspecimen, or there is uncertainty in test procedures, a retest will \nbe allowed. \n8.2 For Grade 8 each of the notched bar impact specimens \nshall display a lateral expansion opposite the notch of not less \nthan 0.015 in. [0.38 mm]. \n8.2.1 When the average lateral expansion value for the three \nimpact specimens equals or exceeds 0.015 in. [0.38 mm] and \nthe value for one specimen is below 0.015 in. [0.38 mm] but \nnot below 0.010 in. [0.25 mm], a retest of three additional \nspecimens may be made. The lateral expansion of each of the \nretest specimens must equal or exceed 0.015 in. [0.38 mm]. \n8.2.2 Lateral expansion values shall be determined by the \nprocedure in Test Methods and Definitions A370. \n8.2.3 The values of absorbed energy in foot-pounds and the \nfracture appearance in percentage shear shall be recorded for \ninformation. A record of these values shall be retained for a \nperiod of at least 2 years. \n9. Lengths \n9 .1 If definite lengths are not required, pipe may be ordered \neither in single random lengths of 16 to 22 ft (Note 4) with \nmaximum 5 % of the lengths between 12 and 16 ft (Note 4), or \nin double random lengths with a minimum average of 35 ft \n(Note 4) and an absolute minimum length of22 ft (Note 4) with \nmaximum 5 % of the lengths between 16 and 22 ft (Note 4). \nNoTE 4-This value(s) applies when the inch-pound designation of this \nspecification is the basis of purchase. When the \"M\" designation of this \nspecification is the basis of purchase, the corresponding metric value(s) \nshaU be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. \n10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n10.l The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient num\u00ad\nber of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable \nassurance that they have been properly evaluated with respect \nto depth. Exploration of all surface imperfections is not \nrequired but may be necessary to ensure compliance with 10.2. \n10.2 Smface imperfections that penetrate more than 12\u00bd % \nof the nominal wall thickness or encroach on the minimum \nwall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with such \ndefects shall be given one of the following dispositions: \n10.2.1 The defect may be removed by grinding provided \nthat the remaining wall thickness is within specified limits. \n10.2.2 Repaired in accordance with the repair welding \nprovisions of 10.5. \n488 \n10.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect may be cut \noff within the limits of requirements on length. \n10.2.4 The defective pipe may be rejected. \n10.3 To provide a workmanlike finish and basis for evalu\u00ad\nating conformance with 10.2, the pipe manufacturer shall \nremove by grinding the following: \n10.3.1 Mechanical marks, abrasions and pits, any of which \nimperfections are deeper than 1/16 in. [1.6 mm], and \n10.3.2 Visual impe1fections commonly referred to as scabs, \nseams, laps, tears, or slivers found by exploration in accor\u00ad\ndance with 10.1 to be deeper than 5 % of the nominal wall \nthickness. \n10.4 At the purchaser's discretion, pipe shall be subject to \nrejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 10.2 are not \nscattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is \nconsidered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall \nbe a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the \npurchaser. \n10.5 When imperfections or defects are removed by \ngrinding, a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the \nwall thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by.
