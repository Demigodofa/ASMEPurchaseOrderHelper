5. l.12 Special requirements or any supplementary 
requirements, or both. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 Chemical Analysis-Samples for chemical analysis, and 
method of analysis, shall be in accordance with Test Methods, 
Practices, and Terminology A751. 
6.2 Heat Analysis-An analysis of each heat of steel shall be 
made by the steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of 
the elements specified. If secondary melting processes are 
employed, the heat analysis shall be obtained from one 
remelted ingot or the product of one remelted ingot of each 
primary melt. The chemical composition thus determined, or 
that determined from a product analysis made by the tubular 
product manufacturer, shall conform to the requirements speci­
fied in the product specification. 
6.2.1 For steels ordered under product specifications refer­
encing this specification of general requirements, the steel shall 
not contain an unspecified element, other than nitrogen for 
stainless steels, for the ordered grade to the extent that the steel 
conforms to the requirements of another grade for which that 
element is a specified element having a required minimum 
content. For this requirement, a grade is defined as an alloy 
described individually and identified by its own UNS designa­
tion in a table of chemical requirements within any specifica­
tion listed within the scope as being covered by this specifi­
cation. 
6.3 Product Analysis-Product analysis requirements and 
options, if any, shall be as contained in the product specifica­
tion. 
7. Tensile Properties 
7 .1 The material shall conform to the tensile property 
requirements prescribed in the individual product specification. 
7 .2 The yield strength, when specified, shall be determined 
corresponding to a permanent offset of 0.2 % of the gauge 
length or to a total extension of 0.5 % of the gauge length under 
load. 
7.3 If the percentage of elongation of any test specimen is 
less than that specified and any part of the fracture is more than 
¾ in. [19.0 mm] from the center of the gauge length, as 
indicated by scribe marks on the specimen before testing, a 
retest shall be allowed. 
8. Standard Mass per Unit Length 
8.1 The calculated mass per foot, based upon a specified 
minimum wall thickness, shall be determined by the following 
equation (see Note 1): 
W= C(D- t)t (I) 
where: 
C = 10.69 [0.0246615], 
W = mass per unit length, lb/ft [kg/m], 
D = specified outside diameter, in. [mm], and 
t = specified minimum wall thickness, in. [mm]. 
Norn 1-The calculated masses given by Eq I are based on the masses 
for carbon steel tubing. The mass of tubing made of ferritic stainless steels 
may be up to about 5 % less, and that made of austenitic stainless steel up 
to about 2 % greater than the values given. Mass of ferritic/austenitic 
(duplex) stainless steel will be intermediate to the mass of fully austenitic 
and fully ferritic stainless steel tubing. 
8.2 The permitted variations from the calculated mass per 
foot [kilogran1 per metre] shall be as prescribed in Table L 
9. Permitted Variations in Wall Thickness 
9.1 Variations from the specified minimum wall thickness 
shall not exceed the amounts prescribed in Table 2. 
9.2 For tubes 2 in. [50 mm] and over in outside diameter and 
0.220 in. [5.6 mm] and over in thickness, the variation in wall 
thickness in any one cross section of any one tube shall not 
exceed the following percentage of the actual mean wall at the 
section. The actual mean wall is defined as the average of the 
thickest and thinnest wall in that section. 
Seamless tubes ±10 % 
Welded tubes ±5 % 
9.3 When cold-finished tubes as ordered require wall thick­
nesses¾ in. [19.1 mm] or over, or an inside diameter 60 % or 
less of the outside diameter, the permitted variations in wall 
thickness for hot-finished tubes shall apply. 
10. Permitted Variations in Outside Diameter 
10.1 Except as provided in 10.2.l, 10.3, and 25.10.4, 
variations from the specified outside diameter shall not exceed 
the amounts prescribed in Table 3. 
10.2 Thin-wall tubes usually develop significant ovality 
(out-of-roundness) during final annealing, or straightening, or 
both. Thin-wall tubes are defined as those with a specified wall 
3 % or less than the specified OD, or with a wall specified as 
0.020 in. [0.5 mm] or less. 
10.2.1 1 The diameter tolerances of Table 3 are not suffi­
cient to provide for additional ovality expected in thin-wall 
.tubes, and, for such tubes, are applicable only to the mean of 
the extreme (maximum and minimum) outside diameter read­
ings in any one cross section. However, for thin wall tubes the 
difference in extreme outside diameter readings (ovality) in any 
one cross section shall not exceed the following ovality 
allowances: 
Outside Diameter, in. [mm] 
1 [25.4] and under 
Over 1 [25.4] 
Ovality Allowance 
0.020 (0.5] 
2.0 % of specified outside 
diameter

sizes over 4 in. [101.6 mm] in outside diameter.
