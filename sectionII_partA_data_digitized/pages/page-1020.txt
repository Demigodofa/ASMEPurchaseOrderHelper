1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers requirements for 
quenched and tempered carbon and alloy steel forgings for 
pressure vessel components. 
1.2 All grades are considered weldable under proper 
conditions. Welding technique is of fundamental impor­
tance, and it is presupposed that welding procedure and 
inspection will be in accordance with approved methods 
for the grade of material used. 
NOTE 1 - Grades 1 and lA have different chemistries but the same 
mechanical requirements. 
NOTE 2 - Designations have been changed as follows: 
Current 
Grade 1 
Grade lA

1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
(metric) units are to be regarded separately as the standard. 
920 
Within the text and tables, the SI units are shown in brack­
ets. The values stated in each system are not exact equiva­
lents; therefore, each system must be used independently 
of the other. Combining values from the two systems may 
result in nonconformance with the specification. 
1.4 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" speci­
fication designation, the material shall be furnished to the 
inch-pound units.

3. Ordering Information and General 
Requirements 
3.1 In addition to the ordering information required by 
Specification A 788, the purchaser shall include with the 
inquiry and order a detailed drawing that locates areas 
of significant loading in the forging (when required); the 
method of selecting test locations (see 6.2); purchase option 
(if any) in accordance with 9.1, and any supplementary 
requirements desired. 
3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform 
to the requirements of Specification A 788, which outlines
