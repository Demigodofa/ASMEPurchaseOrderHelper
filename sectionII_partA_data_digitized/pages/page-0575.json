The axis of the notch shall be normal to \nthe nearest heat-treated surface of the forging. \n8.4.4 The Charpy V-notch tests shall meet a minimum \nenergy absorption value of 40 ft\u00b7lbf [54 J] average of three \nspecimens. One specimen only in one set may be below \n40 ft-lbf [54 J] and it shall meet a minimum value of 35 ft\u00b7lbf \n[48 J]. \n8.4.5 The impact test temperature shall be not warmer than \n0 \u00b0F [-18 \u00b0C]. \n8.4.6 Unless Supplementary Requirement S13 of Specifica\u00ad\ntion A 788/ A 788M is specified by the purchaser, for Grade \nF6NM forgings a minimum average absorbed energy of \n20 ft-lbf [27 J] for each test shall apply at a temperature not \nwarmer than -100 \u00b0F [-73 \u00b0C]. \n9. Ultrasonic Examination \n9.1 For F91 Type 1 and Type 2 and F92 hollow forgings, \neither S20, Ultrasonic Examination, or S22, Ultrasonic Exami\u00ad\nnation from the Bore Surface, of Specification A788/A788M, \nshall be mandatory. \n10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n10.1 When fOigings have been heat-treated by quenching \nand tempering, all accessible surfaces shall subsequently be \nexamined for quench cracks by the magnetic particle method in \naccordance with Practice A275/A275M. \n11. Repair Welding \n11.1 Repair welding of forgings may be permitted but only \nat the option of the purchaser. Such repair welds shall be made \nin accordance with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel \nCode, Section IX. \n11.2 All repair welds in F91 Type 1 and Type 2 shall be \nmade with one of the following welding processes and con\u00ad\nsumables: SMAW, SFA5.5 E90XX-B9; SAW, SFA5.23 EB9 + \nflux; GTAW, SFA5.28 ER90S-B9; and FCAW 5.29 E91Tl-B9. \nIn addition, the sum of the Ni+Mn content of all welding \nconsumables used to fabricate F91 Type 1 and Type 2 forgings \nshall not exceed 1.0 %. \n11.3 All repair welds in F92 shall be made with one of the \nfollowing processes: SMAW, SAW, GTAW, or FCAW; and the \ncomposition of the welding consumables shall meet the re\u00ad\nquirements for F92 in Table 2. 6 \n12. Marking \n12.1 In addition to the marking requirements of Specifica\u00ad\ntion A788/A788M, the specification marking shall be followed \nby the letter A for annealed, N for normalized and tempered, or \nQ for liquid quenched and tempered as applicable. \n12.2 For F91 additional marking shall include the appropri\u00ad\nate Type. \n13. Test Reports \n13.1 The certification requirements of Specification A788/ \nA 788M shall apply. \n14. Keywords \n14.1 chromium alloy steel; chromium-molybdenum steel; \nmartensitic stainless steel; pressure containing parts; pressure \nvessel service; steel forgings-alloy; temperature service \napplications-high \n6 This requirement ensures that the sum of Ni + Mn in the welding consumables \nshall not exceed 1.0 %. \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nOne or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the \npurchaser in the inquiry, contract, and order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be \nagreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. \nSl. Rough Turning and Boring \nS 1.1 The position of the rough turning and boring in the \nsequence of manufacturing operations shall be specified. \nS2. \u2022 Transverse Mechanical Testing \nS2.1 Instead of test specimens taken in accordance with \n8.2.1, the longitudinal axis of the test specimens shall be \ntransverse to the direction of major working of the forging. The \ntension test results shall conform with requirements of Table 1, \nwith the exception of the ductility limits which shall be as \nprescribed in Table S2. l. When required, the Charpy impact \ntest results shall conform to 8.4. \nS3. Alternative Test Specimen Requirements \nS3.l The test requirements for materials of the ASME \nBoiler and Pressure Code, Section III, Article NB-2223.3, shall \nbe used in place of that specified in 8.2.1.1. \n523 \nS4. Hydrostatic Test \nS4.1 A hydrostatic pressure test shall be applied. The details \nof the test, including its position in the sequence of manufac\u00ad\nturing operations, shall be specified. \nS6. Liquid Penetrant Examination \nS6.1 After forgings have been heat-treated by quenching \nand tempering, all accessible surfaces shall be inspected for \nquench cracks by the liquid penetrant method in accordance \nwith Practice E165/E165M as an alternative to magnetic \nparticle examination. \nS7. Marking \nS7 .1 Forgings shall be marked at a location indicated by the \npurchaser in the purchase order or drawing. ",
