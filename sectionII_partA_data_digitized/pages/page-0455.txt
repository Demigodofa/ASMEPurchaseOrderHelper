TABLE 2 Number of Tubes in a Lot Heat Treated by the 
Continuous Process 
Size of Lot 
Size of Tube 
2 in. [50.8 mm] and over in outside diameter and not more than 50 tubes 
0.200 in. [5.1 mm] and over in wall thickness 
Less than 2 in. [50.8 mm] b·ut over 1 in. [25.4 mm] not more than 75 tubes 
in outside diameter or over .1 in. [25.4 mm] in 
outside diameter and under 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] in 
wall thickness 
1 in. [25.4 mm] or less in outside diameter not more than 125 tubes 
include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the 
same furnace at the same temperature, time at heat, and furnace 
speed. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
4.1.2 Name of material (seamless or welded tubes), 
4.1.3 Grade (Table 1), 
4.1.4 Size (outside diameter and nominal wall thickness), 
4.1.5 Length (specific or random), 
4.1.6 Optional requirements (hydrostatic or nondestructive 
electric test, Section 16), 
4.1.7 Test report required (Certification Section of Specifi-
cation Al016/A1016M), 
4.1.8 Specification designation, 
4.1.9 lntergranular corrosion test, and 
4.1.10 Special requirements. 
5. General Requirements 
5.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of Specification Al016/ 
Al016M unless otherwise provided herein. 
6. Manufacture 
6.1 The tubes shall be made by the seamless or welded 
process with no filler metal added. 
7. Heat Treatment 
7.1 As a final heat treatment, tubes shall be reheated to a 
temperature of 1200 °P [650 °C] or higher and cooled (as 
appropriate for the grade) to meet the requirements of this 
specification. 
7.2 The martensitic grade UNS S 41500 shall be reheated to 
a temperature of 950 °P [510 °C] or higher and cooled as 
appropriate to meet the requirements of this specification. 
8. Chemical Composition 
8.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements 
prescribed in Table 1. 
9. Product Analysis 
9 .1 An analysis of either one billet or one length of flatrolled 
stock or one tube shall be made from each heat. The chemical 
composition thus determined shall conform to the requirements 
specified. 
9 .2 The product analysis tolerance of the Chemical Require­
ments Table of A480/ A480M shall apply. The product analysis 
tolerance is not applicable to the carbon content for material 
with a specified maximum carbon of 0.04 % or less. 
9.3 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional billets, lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall 
be made. Both retests for the elements in question shall meet 
the requirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining 
material in the heat or lot shall be rejected or, at the option of 
the producer, each billet or tube may be individually tested for 
acceptance. Billets, lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes which 
do not meet the requirements of the specification shall be 
rejected. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 The material shall conform to the tensile properties 
prescribed in Tables 3 and 4. 
11. Hardness Requirements 
11.1 The tubes shall have a hardness number not to exceed 
those prescribed in Table 5. 
12. Permissible Variations in Dimensions 
12.1 Variations in outside diameter, wall thickness, and 
length from those specified shall not exceed the amounts 
prescribed in Table 6. 
12.2 The permissible variations in outside diameter given in 
Table 6 are not sufficient to provide for ovality in thin-walled 
tubes, as defined in the Table. In such tubes, the maximum and 
minimum diameters at any cross section shall deviate from the 
nominal diameter by no more than twice the permissible 
variation in outside diameter given in Table 6; however, the 
mean diameter at that cross section must still be within the 
given permissible variation. 
12.3 When the specified wall is 2 % or less of the specified 
outside diameter, the method of measurement is in accordance 
with the agreement between the purchaser and the manufac­
turer (see Note 1). 
403 
NoTE 1-Very thin wall tubing may not be stiff enough for the outside 
diameter to be accurately measured with a point contact test method, such 
as with the use of a micrometer or caliper. When very thin walls are 
specified, "go"-"no go" ring gages are commonly used to measure 
diameters of 1 ½ in. (38.1 mm] or less. A 0.002-in. (0.05-mm] additional 
tolerance is usually added on the "go" ring gage to allow clearance for 
sliding. On larger diameters, measurement is commonly performed with a 
pi tape. Other test methods such as optical test methods may also be 
considered. 
13. Surface Condition 
13.1 All tubes shall be free of excessive mill scale, suitable 
for inspection. A slight amount of oxidation will not be
