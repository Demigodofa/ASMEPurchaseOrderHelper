Scope \n1.1 This specification covers age-hardening stainless \nsteel forgings for general use. \n1.2 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \n(metric) units are to be regarded separately as standards; \nwithin the text and tables, the SI units are shown in [brack\u00ad\nets]. The values stated in each system are not exact equiva\u00ad\nlents; therefore, each system must be used independent of \nthe other. Combining values from the two systems may \nresult in nonconformance with the specification. \n1.3 Unless the order specifies an \"M\" designation, the \nmaterial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. \nNOTE 1 -Bar products are covered by Specification A 564/ A 564M. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA 370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Test\u00ad\ning of Steel Products \nA 484/ A 484M Specification for General Requirements \nfor Stainless Steel Bars, Billets, and Forgings \nA 564/A 564M Specification for Hot-Rolled and Cold\u00ad\nFinished Age-Hardening Stainless Steel Bars and Shapes \nA 751 Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology for \nChemical Analysis of Steel Products \nE 527 Practice for Numbering Metals and Alloys (UNS) \n2.2 Other Documents: \nSAE J 1086 Recommended Practice for Numbering Metals \nand Alloys (UNS) \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify \nall requirements that are necessary for material ordered \nunder this specification. Such requirements may include \nbut are not limited to the following: \n3.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), \n3.1.2 Name of material (age-hardening stainless steel \nforgings), \n3.1.3 Dimensions, including prints or sketches, \n3.1.4 Type or UNS designation (Table 1), \n3.1.5 Heat treated condition (Section 5), \n3.1.6 Transverse properties when required (7.4), \n3.1.7 ASTM designation and date of issue, and \n3.1.8 Special requirements (5.3, 5.4). \n3.2 If possible the intended end use of the item should \nbe given on the purchase order, especially when the item \nis ordered for a specific end use or uses. \nNOTE 2 - A typical ordering description is as follows: 5 age-hardening \nstainless steel forgings, Type 630, solution-annealed, ASTM Specification \nA 705 dated _ . End use: pump blocks for oil well equipment. \n4. General Requirements \n4.1 In addition to the requirements of this specification, \nall requirements of the current edition of Specification \nA 484/A 484M shall apply. Failure to comply with the \ngeneral requirements of Specification A 484 / A 484 M, con\u00ad\nstitutes nonconformance with this specification. \n5. Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 Material for forgings shall consist of billets or bars, \neither forged, rolled or cast, or a section cut from an ingot. \nThe cuts shall be made to the required length by a suitable \nprocess. This material may be specified to Specification \nA 564/ A 564M. \n5.2 The material shall be forged by hammering, press\u00ad\ning, rolling, extruding, or upsetting to produce a wrought \nstructure throughout and shall be brought as nearly as \npossible to the finished shape and size by hot working. \n1166 ",
