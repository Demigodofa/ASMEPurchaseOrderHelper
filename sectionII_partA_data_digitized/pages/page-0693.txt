ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-376/SA-376M 
10. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
10.1 Each pipe shall be subjected to the Nondestmctive 
Electric Test or the Hydrostatic Test. Unless specified by the 
purchaser, either test may be used at the option of the producer. 
10.2 Hydrostatic Test-Each length of finished pipe shall be 
subjected to the hydrostatic test in accordance with Specifica­
tion A999/ A999M, unless specifically exempted under the 
provisions of 10.3 and 10.4. 
10.3 For pipe sizes NPS 24 [DN 600] and over, the 
purchaser, with the agreement of the manufacturer, may 
complete the hydrostatic test requirement with the system 
pressure test, which may be lower or higher than the specifi­
cation test pressure, but in no case shall the test pressure be 
lower than the system design pressure. Each length of pipe 
furnished without the completed manufacturer's hydrostatic 
test shall include with the mandatory marking the letters "NH." 
10.4 Nondestructive Examination-Each pipe shall be ex­
amined with a nondestmctive test in accordance with Practice 
E213 or Practice E426. Unless specifically called out by the 
purchaser, the selection of the nondestructive electric test will 
be at the option of the manufacturer. The range of pipe sizes 
that may be examined by each method shall be subject to the 
limitations in the scope of the respective practices. 
10.4.1 The following information is for the benefit of the 
user of this specification: 
10.4.1.1 The reference standards defined in 10.10.1 through 
11.l 0.4 are convenient standards for calibration of nondestruc­
tive testing equipment. The dimensions of these standards 
should not be construed as the minimum size imperfection 
detectable by such equipment. 
10.4.1.2 The ultrasonic testing (UT) can be performed to 
detect both longitudinally and circumferentially oriented de­
fects. It should be recognized that different techniques should 
be employed to detect differently oriented imperfections. The 
examination may not detect short, deep, defects. 
10.4.1.3 The eddy-current testing (ET) referenced in Prac­
tice E426 has the capability of detecting significant 
discontinuities, especially the short abrupt type. 
10.4.1.4 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
10.5 Time of Examination-Nondestructive testing for 
specification acceptance shall be performed after all mechani­
cal processing, heat treatments, and straightening operations. 
This requirement does not preclude additional testing at earlier 
stages in the processing. 
10.6 Surface Condition: 
10.6.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, paint, 
or other foreign material that could interfere with interpretation 
of test results. The methods used for cleaning and preparing the 
surfaces for examination shall not be detrimental to the base 
metal or the surface finish. 
10.6.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can 
produce signals that interfere with the test. 
10.7 Extent of Examination: 
10.7.1 The relative motion of the pipe and the transducer(s), 
coil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire pipe surface is 
scanned, except as in 5.2. 
10.7.2 The existence of end effects is recognized, and the 
extent of such effects shall be determined by the manufacturer, 
and, if requested, shall be repo1ied to the purchaser. Other 
nondestmctive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
10.8 Operator Qualifications-The test unit operator shall 
be certified in accordance with SNT-TC-lA, or an equivalent 
recognized and documented standard. 
10.9 Test Conditions: 
10.9.1 For eddy-current testing, the excitation coil fre­
quency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration yet 
provide good signal-to-noise ratio. 
10.9.2 The maximum eddy-cmrent coil frequency used 
shall be as follows: 
Specified Wall Thickness, in. [mm] Maximum Frequency, KHz 
<0.050 [1.25] 100 
0.050 to 1.50 [1.25 to 3.80] 50 
>0.150 [3.80] 10 
10.9.3 Ultrasonic-For examination by the ultrasonic 
method, the minimum nominal transducer frequency shall be 
2.00 MHz and the maximum nominal transducer size shall be 
1.5 in. [38 mm]. 
10.9.3.1 If the equipment contains a reject notice filter 
setting, this shall remain off during calibration and testing 
unless linearity can be demonstrated at that setting. 
10.10 Reference Standards: 
10.10.1 Reference standards of convenient length shall be 
prepared from a length of pipe of the same grade, size (NPS, or 
outside diameter and schedule or wall tl1ickness), surface 
finish, and heat treatment condition as the pipe to be examined. 
10.10.2 For Ultrasonic Testing, the reference ID and OD 
notches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes 
shown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The 
depth of each notch shall not exceed 12½ % of the specified 
nominal wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], 
whichever is greater. The width of the notch shall not exceed 
twice the depth. Notches shall be placed on both the OD and ID 
surfaces. 
643 
10.10.3 For Eddy-Current Testing, the reference standard 
shall contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following discontinuities: 
10.10.3.1 Drilled Hole-The reference standard shall con­
tain three or more holes, equally spaced circumferentially 
around the pipe and longitudinally separated by a sufficient 
distance to allow distinct identification of the signal from each 
hole. The holes shall be drilled radially and completely through 
the pipe wall, with care being taken to avoid dist01iion of the 
pipe while drilling. One hole shall be drilled in the weld, if 
visible. Alternately, the producer of welded pipe may choose to 
drill one hole in the weld and mn the calibration standard 
through the test coils three times with the weld turned at 120° 
on each pass. The hole diameter shall vary with NPS as 
follows:
