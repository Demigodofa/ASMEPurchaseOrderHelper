Ordering Information \n3.1 See Specification A960/A960M. \n4. General Requirements \n4.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A960/A960M, including any \nsupplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase \norder. Failure to comply with the general requirements of \nSpecification A960/A960M constitutes non-conformance with \nthis specification. In case of conflict between the requirements \nof this specification and Specification A960/ A960M, this \nspecification shall prevail. \n5. Material \n5.1 The starting material for fittings shall be fully killed \nsteel, consisting of forgings, bars, plates, sheet, and seamless or \nfusion welded tubular products with filler metal added and \nshall conform to the chemical requirements in Table 1. The \nsteels shall be made using recognized melting practices neces\u00ad\nsary to produce steels that shall meet the impact requirements \nof this specification. \n6. Manufacture \n6.1 Forging or forming operations shall be performed by \nhammering, pressing, piercing, extruding, upsetting, working, \nbending, fusion-welding, or machining, or by a combination of \ntwo or more of these operations. The forming procedure shall \nbe so applied that it will not produce injurious defects in the \nfittings. \n6.2 All welds, including welds in tubular products from \nwhich fittings are made, shall be (1) made by welders, welding \noperators and welding procedures qualified under the provi\u00ad\nsions of ASME Section IX, (2) heat treated in accordance with \nSection 7 of this specification, and (3) nondestructively exam\u00ad\nined throughout the entire length of each weld in accordance \nwith Section 15 of this specification. The radiography of welds \nshall be done either prior to or after forming at option of \nmanufacturer. Personnel performing NDE examinations shall \nbe qualified in accordance with SNT-TC- lA. \n6.3 The welded joints of the fittings shall be finished in \naccordance with the requirements of Paragraph UW-35 (a) of \nSection VIII, Division 1 of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel \nCode. \n6.4 All butt-weld tees manufactured by cold-forming meth\u00ad\nods shall be liquid penetrant or magnetic particle examined by \none of the methods specified in Supplementary Requirement \nS52 or S53 of Specification A960/A960M. This examination \nshall be performed after final heat treatment by NDE personnel \nqualified under the provisions of SNT-TC- lA. Only the side\u00ad\nwall areas of the tee need be examined. This area is defined by \na circle that covers the area from the weld bevel of the branch \noutlet to the centerline of the body or run. Internal and external \nsurfaces shall be examined when size permits accessibility. \nAfter the removal of any cracks, the tees shall be re-examined \nby the original method. Acceptable tees shall be marked with \nthe symbol PT or MT, as applicable, to indicate compliance. \n6.5 Stubends may be produced with the entire lap added by \nthe welding of a ring, made from plate or bar of the same alloy \ngrade and composition, to the outside of a straight section of \npipe, provided the weld is double welded, is a full penetration \njoint, satisfies the requirements of 6.2 for qualifications and \nradiography and 7 .1 for post weld heat treatment. \n701 \n7. Heat Treatment \n7.1 All fittings shall be furnished in the normalized, normal\u00ad\nized and tempered, annealed, or quenched and tempered \ncondition. All welding shall be completed prior to the austen\u00ad\nitizing heat treatment. \n7 .2 The full thickness of the material from which impact test \nspecimens are to be obtained shall be heat treated with a \nfurnace charge as specified in 10.4.2 or 10.4.3. \n7 .3 After forming, the fittings shall be allowed to cool below \nthe lower critical before applying one of the heat treatments \nlisted in 7.1. \n7.4 When specified in the order, the test specimens shall be \nsubjected to a simulated post-weld heat treatment before \ntesting. The simulated post-weld heat treatment used shall be ",
