Mechanical Requirements \n7.1 Method of Mechanical Tests-The specimens and the \nmechanical tests required shall be made in accordance with \nAnnex A2 of Test Methods and Definitions A370 if inch-pound \nunits are specified, or to the requirements described in the \napplicable track of Test Methods A1058, if SI units are \nspecified. \n7.2 Specimens shall be tested at room temperature. \n7.3 Small or subsize specimens as described in Test Meth\u00ad\nods and Definitions A370 or Test Methods A1058 may be used \nonly when there is insufficient material to prepare one of the \nstandard specimens. When using small or subsize specimens, \nthe largest one possible shall be used. \n8. Tensile Requirements \n8.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to \ntensile properties prescribed in the individual specifications. \n8.2 The yield strength corresponding to a permanent offset \nof 0.2 % of the gage length or to a total extension of 0.5 % of \nthe gage length under load shall be determined. \n8.3 If the percentage of elongation of any test specimen is \nless than that specified and any part of the fracture is more than \n\u00be in. [19.0 mm] from the center of the gage length, as \nindicated by scribe marks on the specimen before testing, a \nretest shall be allowed. \n9. Permissible Variation in Weight \n9.1 The weight of any length of pipe NPS 12 [DN 300] and \nunder shall not vary more than 10 % over or 3.5 % under that \nspecified. For sizes over NPS 12 [DN 300], the weight of any \nlength of pipe shall not vary more than 10 % over or 5 % under \nthat specified. Unless otherwise specified, pipe of NPS 4 [DN \n100] and smaller may be weighed in convenient lots; pipe in \nsizes larger than NPS 4 [DN 100] shall be weighed separately. \n10. Permissible Variations in Wall Thickness \n----~ro;--1~seamless an e e no ller metal added)-The \nminimum wall thickness at any point shall be within the \ntolerances specified in Table 1, except that for welded pipe the \nTABLE 1 Permissible Variations in Wall Thickness \nNPS Designator \n'Is to 2\u00bd, incl., all t I D A,B ratios \n3 to 18 incl., I ID up to 5 % incl. \n3 to 18 incl., ti D> 5% \n20 and larger, welded, all I I D ratios \n20 and larger, seamless, t I D up to \n5% incl. \n20 and larger, seamless, t I D > 5 % \nAt= Nominal wall thickness. \n8 D = Ordered outside diameter. \nTolerance, % from \nNominal \nOver Under \n20.0 \n22.5 \n15.0 \n17.5 \n22.5 \n15.0 \n12.5 \n12.5 \n12.5 \n12.5 \n12.5 \n12.5 \nweld area shall not be limited by the over tolerance. The \nminimum wall thickness on inspection for - 12.5 % is shown \nin Table Xl.1. \n10.2 Forged and Bored-The wall thickness shall not vary \nover that specified by more than Vs in. [3.2 mm]. There shall be \nno variation under the specified wall thickness. \n10.3 Cast-The wall thickness shall not vary over that \nspecified by more than V16 in. [1.6 mm]. There shall be no \nvariation under the specified wall thickness. \n11. Permissible Variations in Inside Diameter \n11.1 Forged and Bored, and Cast-The inside diameter \nshall not vary under that specified by more than V16 in. [1.6 \nmm]. There shall be no variation over the \u00b7specified inside \ndiameter. \n12. Permissible Variations in Outside Diameter \n12.1 Variations in outside diameter, unless otherwise \nspecified, shall not exceed the limits prescribed in Table 2. The \ntolerances on outside diameter include ovality except as \nprovided for in 12.2. \n12.2 Thin-wall pipe usually develops significant ovality \n(out-of-roundness) during final annealing, straightening, or \nboth. The diameter tolerances of Table 2 are not sufficient to \nprovide for additional ovality expected in thin-wall pipe and \nare applicable only to the mean of the extreme (maximum and \nminimum) outside diameter readings in any one cross-section. \nHowever, for thin-wall pipe the difference in extreme outside \ndiameter readings (ovality) in any one cross-section shall not \nexceed 1.5 % of the specified outside diameter. \n13. Permissible Variations in Length \n13.1 Seamless and Welded (no filler metal added)-If defi\u00ad\nnite cut lengths are ordered, no length of pipe shall be under the \nlength specified and not more than \u00bc in. [6 mm] over that \nspecified. \n13.2 Forged and Bored, Cast, and Cast Cold-Wrought-If \ndefinite cut lengths are ordered, no length of pipe shall be \nlength-spec-ifi-\u20ac:d-and-ne1-mere-than-\u00bc-in:;-[-3--nnrrJuVi~----------r~ \nthat specified. \n896 \n13.3 For pipe ordered to random lengths, the lengths and \nvariations shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and \npurchaser. \nTABLE 2 Permissible Variations in Outside Diameter \nNPS Designator Permissible Variations In Outside Diameter \nOver Under \nin. mm in. mm \n1/a to 1\u00bd, incl 1/a\u2022 (0.015) 0.4 1/a2 (0.031) 0.8 \nOver 1 \u00bd to 4, incl 1/a2 (0.031) 0.8 1/32 (0.031) 0.8 \nOver 4 to 8, incl 1/1a (0.062) 1.6 1/32(0.031) 0.8 \nOver 8 to 18, incl 3/32 (0.093) 2.4 1/a2 (0.031) 0.8 \nOver 18 to 26, incl 1/a (0.125) 3.2 1/02 (0.031) 0.8 \nOver 26 to 34, incl %2 (0.156) 4.0 1/32 (0.031) 0.8 \nOver34 3/ia (0.187) 4.8 1/a2 (0.031) 0.8 \n'..._____./ ",
