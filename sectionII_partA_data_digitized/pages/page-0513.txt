pipe size) or outside diameter and schedule number or average 
wall thickness, heat number, and NH when hydrotesting is not 
performed and ET when eddy-current testing is performed or 
UT when ultrasonic testing is performed. The marking shall 
also include the manufacturer's private identifying mark, the 
marking requirement of 12.3, if applicable, and whether 
seamless (SML), welded (WLD), or heavily cold-worked 
(HCW). For Grades TP304H, TP316H, TP321H, TP347H, 
TP348H, and S30815, the marking shall also include the heat 
number and heat-treatment lot identification. If specified in the 
purchase order, the marking for pipe larger than NPS 4 shall 
include the weight. 
18. Government Procurement 
18.1 Scale Free Pipe for Government Procurement: 
18.1.1 When specified in the contract or order, the following 
requirements shall be considered in the inquiry, contract or 
order, for agencies of the U.S. Government where scale free

dence if there is a conflict between these requirements and the 
product specifications. 
18.1.2 The requirements of Specification A999/ A999M for 
pipe and Specification Al016/Al016M for tubes shall be 
applicable when pipe or tube is ordered to this specification.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the 
purchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided 
in the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, 
retest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. 
Sl. Product Analysis 
S 1.1 For all pipe NPS 5 and larger in nominal size there shall 
be one product analysis made of a representative sample from 
one piece for each ten lengths or fraction thereof from each 
heat of steel. 
S 1.2 For pipe smaller than NPS 5 there shall be one product 
analysis made from ten lengths per heat of steel or from 10 % 
of the number of lengths per heat of steel, whichever number 
is smaller. 
Sl.3 Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical 
requirements specified in Section 7 shall be rejected. 
S2. Transverse Tension Tests 
S2. l There shall be one transverse tension test made from 
one end of 10 % of the lengths furnished per heat of steel. This 
requirement is applicable only to pipe NPS 8 and larger. 
461 
S2.2 If a specimen from any length fails to conform to the 
tensile properties specified that length shall be rejected. 
S3. Flattening Test 
S3.l The flattening test of Specification A999/A999M shall 
be made on a specimen from one end or both ends of each pipe. 
Crop ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is 
specified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. 
If a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility 
prior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening 
test requirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat­
ment in accordance with Specification A999/A999M and 
satisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails 
because of a lack of soundness that length shall be rejected, 
unless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length 
is sound.
