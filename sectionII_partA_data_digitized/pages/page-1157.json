Ordering Information \n3.1 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out\u00ad\nlines additional ordering information, manufacturing \nrequirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, \nmarking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi\u00ad\ntional supplementary requirements. \n3.2 In addition to the ordering requirementsof Specification \nA788/A788M, the purchaser shall include the maximum de\u00ad\nsign temperature (MDT), if lower than 600 \u00b0F [315 \u00b0C], and \nthe maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP), if lower \nthan 250 psi [1.7 MPa] as allowed in 1.2 of the Scope. \n3 .3 When ordering pressure rolls the purchaser shall stipu\u00ad\nlate the required condition, either surface hardened (Condition \nH) or as heat treated (Condition S). In the event that the \ncondition is not specified the default condition is H. \n3.4 If a corrugating roll is required to be surface hardened \nby the forging supplier, prior to forming the flutes by the \npurchaser, the requirements of Supplementary Requirement S 1 \nshall apply. \n3.5 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, then the \nrequirements of this specification shall prevail. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Forging Process: \n4.1.1 Roll body forgings may be made as solid forgings and \nsubsequently bored. \n4.1.2 Trunnions or gudgeons which are to be subsequently \nassembled to form the roll shall be made as a solid forging or \nwhere practical upset from segments cut from billets or bars. \n4.2 Heat Treatment: \n4.2.1 Heat Treatment for Mechanical Properties (Require\u00ad\nments do not apply to surface treatment): \n4.2.1.1 Machining-The forged roll body shall have all \nsurfaces rough machined, including boring, prior to heat \ntreatment for mechanical properties and be tested in accor\u00ad\ndance with 6.1.2.1. The manufacturer may opt to bore after \nheat treatment for mechanical properties instead provided the \nforging is tested in accordance with 6.1.2.2. \n4.2.1.2 Roll bodies shall be normalized, liquid quenched, \nand tempered to produce the required mechanical properties, \nexcept that for Class 2 forgings, and when Grade 2 strength \nrequirements are specified, a normalize and temper heat \ntreatment may be applied. \n4.2.1.3 The trunnions shall be normalized and tempered or \nannealed to produce the required mechanical properties. \n4.2.2 Su,face Hardening of Pressure Roll Forgings-For \nCondition H the working face of pressure rolls shall be surface \nhardened either before or after fitting the trunnions, at the \nmanufacturer's option. Surface hardening by weld overlays is \nnot permitted for Condition H or (subsequently) for Condition \ns. \n4.3 Assembly and Weld-Except for integrally forged or \nbolted-on trunnions, the assembly shall be made by shrink \nfitting trunnions into the prepared body ends. If used, welding \nof the trunnion to the roll body is restricted to a 3/s in. [9.5 mm] \nmax. seal weld, made with low hydrogen materials. A mini\u00ad\nmum preheat of 400 \u00b0F [205 \u00b0C] and a minimum post weld \nheat treatment of 850 \u00b0F [455 \u00b0C] for 8 h shall be used. The \nmaximum post weld heat treatment shall be not higher than t -\n50 \u00b0F [t - 28 \u00b0C] where tis the final tempering temperature. All \nwelds shall be machined or ground for the final magnetic \nparticle or liquid penetrant examination. \n1063 ",
