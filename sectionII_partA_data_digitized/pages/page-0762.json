Scope \n1.1 This specification covers centrifugally cast alloy steel \npipe intended for use in high-temperature, high-pressure ser\u00ad\nvice. \n1.2 Several grades of ferritic steels are covered. Their \ncompositions are given in Table 1. \n1.3 Supplementary Requirements Sl through S12 are \nprovided. The supplementary requirements provide for addi\u00ad\ntional tests of an optional nature and when desired shall be so \nstated in the order (Section 4). \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n1.4.1 Within the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. \nl .5 This standard does not purport to address all of the \nsafety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the \nresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro\u00ad\npriate safety and health practices and determine the applica\u00ad\nbility of regulatory limitations prior to use. \n2.
