General Conditions for Delivery \n3.1 Except for investment castings and centrifugally cast \npipe, castings furnished to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A703/A703M, including any \nsupplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase \norder. Failure to comply with the general requirements of \nSpecification A703/A703M constitutes nonconformance with \nthis specification. In case of conflict between the requirements \nof this specification and Specification A703/A703M, this \nspecification shall prevail. \n3.2 Investment castings furnished to this specification shall \nconform to the requirements of Specification A985/A985M, \nincluding any supplementary requirements that are indicated in \nthe purchase order. Failure to comply with the general require\u00ad\nments of Specification A985/A985M constitutes nonconfor\u00ad\nmance with this specification. In case of conflict between the \nrequirements of this specification and Specification A985/ \nA985M, Specification A985/ A985M shall prevail. \n3.3 Centrifugally cast pipe furnished under this specification \nshall conform to the requirements of Specification A999/ \nA999M, including any supplementary requirements that are \nindicated in the purchase order. Failure to comply with the \ngeneral requirements of Specification A999/A999M consti\u00ad\ntutes nonconformance with this specification. In case of con\u00ad\nflict between the requirements of this specification and Speci\u00ad\nfication A999/A999M, this specification shall prevail. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 Orders for material under this specification shall include \nthe following, as required, to describe the desired material \nadequately: \n4.1.1 Except for centrifugally cast pipe: \n4.1.1.1 A description of the casting by pattern number or \ndrawing ( dimensional tolerances shall be included on the \ncasting drawing), \n4.1.1.2 Grade and class of steel, \n4.1.1.3 Options in the specification (see 5.1.5, 5.2, 7.1.4, \n8.4, 10.3.5, and 10.3.7, 10.3.8.2, and 10.3.8.3), \n4.1.1.4 Whether the castings are to be produced using the \ninvestment casting process, and \n4.1.1.5 The supplementary requirements desired including \nthe standards of acceptance. \n4.1.2 Centrifugally cast pipe: \n5 Available from American Weldmg Society (AWS), 8669 NW 36 St., #130, \nMiami, FL 33166-6672, http://www.aws.org. \n4.1.2.1 Quantity (feet, centimeters, or number of lengths), \n4.1.2.2 Name of material (centrifugally cast pipe), \n4.1.2.3 Grade of steel, \n4.1.2.4 Size (outside or inside diameter and minimum wall \nthickness), \n4.1.2.5 Length (specific or random) (Section on Permissible \nVariations in Length of Specification A999/A999M), \n4.1.2.6 End finish (Section on Ends of Specification A999/ \nA999M), \n4.1.2.7 Options in the specification (see 5.1.5, 5.2, 7.1.4, \n8.4, 10.3.5, and 10.3.7, 10.3.8.2, and 10.3.8.3), \n4.1.2.8 Whether the castings are to be used in ASME Boiler \nand Pressure Vessel Code Sections I, ID, IV, vm, and XII \nconstruction; or in ASME Codes B16.34, B31.l, B31.3, or \nother ASME construction codes, and \n4.1.2.9 The supplementary requirements desired. \n5. Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 Heat Treatment-Grades shall be furnished in the aus\u00ad\ntenitized and tempered condition. Before heat treatment, cast\u00ad\nings shall be allowed to cool to a temperature below the \ntransformation. range. \n5 .1.1 Grade C91 shall be heat treated by heating to a \ntemperature range of 1900 to 1975 \u00b0F [1040 to 1080 \u00b0C] and \neither air cooled or accelerated cooled from the austenitizing \ntemperature by air blasting or liquid quenching, to a tempera\u00ad\nture of 200 \u00b0F [95 \u00b0C] or below, followed by tempering at 1350 \nto 1470 \u00b0F [730 to 800 \u00b0C]. \n5.1.2 Grade C933 shall be heat treated by heating to a \ntemperature range of 2010 to 2190 \u00b0F [1100 to 1200 \u00b0C] and \neither air cooled or accelerated cooled from the austenitizing \ntemperature by air blasting or liquid quenching to a tempera\u00ad\nture of 200 \u00b0F [95 \u00b0C] or below, followed by tempering at 1350 \nto 1440 \u00b0F [730 to 780 \u00b0C]. \n5.1.3 Compliance with the temperature ranges specified in \n5.1.1 and 5.1.2 for castings heat treated singly shall be verified \nby a thermocouple or thermocouples placed directly on the \ncastings. \n5.1.4 Compliance with the temperature ranges specified in \n5.1.1 and 5.1.2 for castings heat treated in batches shall be \nverified by thermocouples placed on selected castings in each \nbatch. \n5.1.5 Unless specified by the purchaser, the number and \nlocations of thermocouples to be placed on each casting, or on \ncastings in each heat-treatment batch, shall be at the discretion \nof the producer. \n5.1.6 A record of the final austenitizing and tempering heat \ntreatment and, if specified in the order (see 10.3.7) of any and \nall subsequent subcritical heat treatments, shall be made and \nshall be shown on the material test report. The record shall \ninclude both the number and locations of thermocouples \napplied to each casting, or to each heat-treatment batch of \ncastings. \n5.2 Machining-Centrifugally cast pipe shall be machined \non the inner and outer surfaces to a roughness value no greater \nthan 250 \u00b5in.
