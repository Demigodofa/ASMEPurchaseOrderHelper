The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided \nin the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, \nretest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. \nSl. Product Analysis \nS 1.1 For all pipe NPS 5 and larger in nominal size, there \nshall be one product analysis made of a representative sample \nfrom one piece for each ten lengths or fraction thereof from \neach heat of steel. \nSl.2 For pipe smaller than NPS 5 in nominal size there shall \nbe one product analysis made from ten lengths per heat of steel \nor from 10 % of the number of lengths per heat of steel, \nwhichever number is smaller. \nS 1.3 Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical \nrequirements specified in Section 6 shall be rejected. \nS2. Transverse Tension Tests \nS2.1 There shall be one transverse tension test made from \none end of 10 % of the lengths furnished per heat of steel. This \napplies only to pipe NPS 8 and larger in nominal size. \nS2.2 If a specimen from any length fails to conform to the \ntensile properties specified, that length shall be rejected. \nS3. Flattening Test \nS3.1 The flattening test of Specification A999/A999M shall \nbe made on a specimen from one or both ends of each pipe. \nCrop ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is \nspecified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. \nIf a specimen from any length fails because of ductility prior to \nsatisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening test \nrequirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreatment \nin accordance with Specification A999/ A999M and satisfac\u00ad\ntory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails because \nof a lack of soundness, that length shall be rejected, unless \nsubsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length is \nsound. \nS4. Etching Tests \nS4.1 The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching \ntests conducted in accordance with the appropriate portions of \nMethod E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section \nfrom one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound \nwelds and reasonably uniform material free of injurious \nlaminations, cracks, and similar objectionable imperfections. If \nthis supplementary requirement is specified, the number of \ntests per pipe required shall also be specified. If a specimen \nfrom any length shows objectionable imperfections, the length \nshall be rejected subject to the removal of the defective end and \nsubsequent retests indicating the remainder of the length to be \nsound and reasonably uniform material. \nS5. Eddy Current Examination \nS5.1 Pipe soundness shall be determined through eddy\u00ad\ncurrent examination made in accordance with requirements as \nagreed upon between the pipe manufacturer and purchaser. \nS6. Ultrasonic Examination \nS6.1 Pipe soundness shall be determined through ultrasonic \nexamination made in accordance with requirements as agreed \nupon between the pipe manufacturer and purchaser. \nS7. Corrosion Requirements \nS7.1 Boiling Nitric Acid Test-Except for Grade TP 321, \ncoupons representing finished pipe made of nonmolybdenum\u00ad\nbearing material (0.50 % and less molybdenum) shall meet the \nrequirements Practice C of Practices A262. The condition of \nthe test specimens and the corrosion rates are as follows: Types \n304L, 304LN, 347, and Type 348 shall be tested in the \nsensitized condition (heated for 1 hat 1240 \u00b0F [670 \u00b0C]) and \nthe rate of penetration shall not exceed 0.0020 in. \n[0.05 mm]/2nonth. All other nonmolybdenum-bearing types, \nexcept for Grade TP 321, shown in Table 2 shall be tested in the \nannealed and unsensitized condition and the rate of penetration \nwhen solution tested in accordance with Practice C shall not \nexceed 0.0015 in./month [0.038 mm/month]. \nS7.2 Acidified Copper Sulfate Test-Coupons representing \nfinished pipe made of molybdenum-bearing material (over \n0.50 % molybdenum) and Type 321 shall meet the require\u00ad\nments of Practice E of Practices A262. The condition of the test \nspecimen is as follows: Types 316L, 316LN, 317L and 321 \nshall be tested in the sensitized condition (heated for 1 h at \n1240 \u00b0F [670 \u00b0C]). All molybdenum-bearing types shown in \nTable 2 shall be tested in the annealed and unsensitized \ncondition. All specimens shall meet the requirements of the \nprescribed bend tests. \nS8. Flange Test \nS8. l A section of pipe shall be capable of having a flange \nturned over at a right angle to the body of the pipe without \ncracking. The width of the flange shall be not less than 15 % of \nthe oustide diameter of the pipe. \n1329 ",
