Scope \n1.1 This specification covers bars and shapes of age\u00ad\nhardening stainless steels. Hot-finished or cold-finished \nrounds, squares, hexagons, bar shapes, angles, tees, and \nchannels are included; these shapes may be produced by \nhot rolling, extruding, or forging. Billets or bars for reforg\u00ad\ning may be purchased to this specification. \n1.2 These steels are generally used for parts requiring \ncorrosion resistance and high strength at room temperature, \nor at temperatures up to 600\u00b0F [315\u00b0C]; 700\u00b0F (370\u00b0C] \nfor Type 632; 840\u00b0F [450\u00b0C] for Type UNS S46910. They \nare suitable for machining in the solution-annealed condi\u00ad\ntion after which they may be age-hardened to the mechani\u00ad\ncal properties specified in Section 7 without danger of \ncracking or distortion. Type XM-25 is machinable in the \nas-received fully heat treated condition. Type UNS S46910 \nis suitable for machining in the solution-annealed, cold\u00ad\nworked, and aged-hardened condition. \n2.
