3.1.8 Test report required (Certification Section of Specifi­
cation A530/ A530M), 
3.1.9 Specification designation, and 
3.1.10 Special requirements. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A530/ A530M unless otherwise provided herein. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Machining: 
5.1.1 All centrifugally cast pipe shall have both the inner 
and outer surfaces machined. 
5.1.2 After heat treatment, the pipe shall be machined to a 
finish with a roughness value no greater than 250 µin. (6.35 
µm) arithmetical average deviation (AA), terms as defined in 
ANSI B46. l unless otherwise specified. 
5.2 Heat Treatment: 
5.2.1 All pipe shall receive a heat treatment proper for its 
design and chemical composition. 
5.2.2 Castings shall be heat treated after they have been 
allowed to cool below the transformation range. 
6. Temperature Control 
6.1 Furnace temperatures for heat treating shall be effec­
tively controlled by pyrometers. 
7. Chemical Requirements 
7. l The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition presclibed in Table 1. 
7 .2 Product Analysis: 
7 .2.1 At the request of the purchaser, a product analysis 
shall be made by the manufacturer on every heat. 
7 .2.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the 
purchaser or his representative, and shall conform to the 
requirements specified in Table 1. 
7.2.3 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 7.2.l 
does not conform to the requirements specified, an analysis of 
each pipe from the same heat may be made, and all pipes 
conforming to the requirements shall be accepted. 
8. Mechanical Requirements 
8.1 Tensile Properties: 
8.1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to 
tensile properties presclibed in Table 2.

8.1.2 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One test 
shall be made on a specimen from one end of one length of 
pipe representing each heat in each heat-treatment lot. 
8.2 Flattening Test: 
8.2.1 A flattening test shall be performed when requested by 
the purchaser or when stated by the purchaser on the order that 
the pipe is to be upset, swaged, expanded, bent, or formed by 
some other operation. 
8.2.2 A flattening test need not be performed on heavy wall 
pipe which is not to be upset, swaged, expanded, bent, or 
formed in some other manner. 
8.2.3 When required by 8.2, a test shall be made on 
specimens cut from one end of each length of pipe. 
8.2.4 A flattening test when required shall be performed in 
accordance with the requirements for seamless and centrifu­
gally cast pipe in the Flattening Test Requirements Section of 
Specification A530/ A530M. 
Nore 1-In heavy-walled small-diameter tubing the flattening test 
specimen may be bored out so that the OD/t ratio will be greater than 11.0. 
8.3 Hydrostatic Test: 
8.3.1 Each length of pipe shall be hydrostatically tested in 
accordance with the Hydrostatic Test Requirements Section of 
Specification A530/A530M when requested by the purchaser 
and stated on the order. If performance of the hydrostatic test 
is not required by the purchaser, the manufacturer shall 
guarantee pipe to pass the test and mark each length of pipe 
with the letters "NH" immediately following the specification 
number, indicating that the pipe has not been hydrostatically 
tested. 
8.3.2 When required by 8.3, each length of pipe shall be 
subjected to the hydrostatic test. The test pressure shall be 
maintained for not less than 5 min. 
9. Permissible Variation in Wall Thickness 
9.1 The wall thickness shall not vary over the specified 
minimum wall thickness by more than 10 %. There shall be no 
variation under the specified minimum wall thickness. 
Norn 2-A system of standard pipe sizes has been approved by the 
American National Standards Institute, as ANSI B36.10. This system may 
be used for obtaining pipe under this specification. 
10. Workmanship and Finish 
10.1 The pipe shall have a finish as provided in 5.2 and it 
shall be reasonably straight and free from injurious defects. 
11. Rework and Retreatment 
11.1 Impeifections-The surface of the casting shall be 
inspected visually for cracks and hot tears. These imperfections 
shall be removed, and their removal verified by visual inspec­
tion of the resultant cavities. Imperfections located by inspect­
ing with Supplementary Requirements S7, S8, or S9 shall be 
removed or reduced to an acceptable size. 
11.2 Blending-If removal of the imperfection does not 
infringe upon the minimum wall thickness, the depression may 
be blended uniformly into the surrounding surface. 
11.3 Repair by Welding-Imperfections that infringe upon 
the minimum wall thickness may be repaired by welding 
subject to approval by the purchaser. Only qualified operators
