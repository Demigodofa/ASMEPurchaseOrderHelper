Scope \n1.1 This specification covers 7, 8, and 9 % nickel alloy \nsteel plates for use in the water quenched and tempered \ncondition intended for the fabrication of welded pressure \nvessels. \n1.2 Material under this specification is available in three \ntypes having different chemical composition as follows: \nType Nominal Nickel Content, % \nI 9 \nII 8 \nIll 7 \n1.3 Plates produced under this specification are subject to \nimpact testing at -320\u00b0F [-195\u00b0C] for Type I or Type III, and \n-275\u00b0F [-170\u00b0C] for Type II; or at such other temperatures as \nare agreed upon. \n1.4 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the \ncapacity of the material to meet the specified mechanical \nproperty requirements; however, current mill practice normally \nlimits this material to 2 in. [50 mm] max. \n1.5 This material is susceptible to magnetization. Use of \nmagnets in handling after heat treatment should be avoided if \nresidual magnetism would be detrimental to subsequent fabri\u00ad\ncation or service. \n1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must \nbe used independently of the other. Combining values from the \ntwo systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi\u00ad\ncation. \n1.7 This standard does not purport to address_ftll_gfthe _ \nsafety conc~rnS: iTany, ciisoeiated with its ~se. It is the \nresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-\npriate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter\u00ad\nmine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. \n1.8 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.

General Requirements and Ordering Information \n3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall \nconform to Specification A20/ A20M. These requirements out\u00ad\nline the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit\u00ad\nted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of \ndefects, marking, loading, and ordering information. \n3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this \nspecification, certain supplementary requirements are available \nwhen additional control, testing, or examination is required to \nmeet end use requirements. The purchaser is refe1Ted to the \nli-sted,mpple-mentaryrequfremenrs\u00b7iuiliissj:,ecincation. and\u00b7 to \nthe detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. \n3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require\u00ad\nments of this specification shall prevail. \n940 ",
