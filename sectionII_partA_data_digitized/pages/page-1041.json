Manufacture \n4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and \nshall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of \nSpecification A20/ A20M. \n5. Heat Treatment \n5.1 All plates shall be heat treated in accordance with 5.2. \nShell plates and other parts, including heads and reinforcing \npads, which are heated for forming, shall be heat treated after \n5.2.2.1 Prior to the tempering tTeatment, the plates may be \nsubjected to an intermediate heat treatment consisting of \nheating to a temperature in the range from 1165 to 1290\u00b0F [630 \nto 700\u00b0C] for Type I, or 1185 to 1310\u00b0F [640 to 710\u00b0C] for \nType II, or 1205 to 1330\u00b0F [650 to 720\u00b0C] for Type III; holding \nat that temperature for a suitable time, but in no case less than \n15 min, and then water-quenching to below 300\u00b0F [150\u00b0C] in \nthe case of plate thicknesses of more than 5 /s in. [16 mm] or \ncooling in air or water-quenching to below 300\u00b0F [150\u00b0C] in \nthe case of plate thicknesses of 5/s in. [16 mm] and under. \nNoTE 1-The intermediate heat treatment is for the purpose of \nenhancing elongation and notch-toughness and for reducing susceptibility \nto strain-aging embrittlement and temper embrittlement. It may be \nperformed at the option of the material manufacturer or may be specified \nby the purchaser. \n6. Chemical Requirements \nforming in accordance with 5.2. 6.1 The steel shall confom1 to the chemical requirements \n5.2 Heat Treatment Procedure-Heat treat all plates by shown in Table I unless otherwise modified in accordance with \nheating to a suitable temperature within the range from 1475 to Supplementary Requirement S17, Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized \n1700\u00b0F [800 to 925\u00b0C], holding for a sufficient time to obtain Steel, in Specification A20/ A20M. \nuniform temperature throughout the plate thickness and then 7.
