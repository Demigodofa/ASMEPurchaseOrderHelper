At least eight samples shall be checked from each batch \nload and a least one check/h shall be made from a continuous \nrun. When the furnace batch charge is less than eight parts, \neach part shall be checked. If any hardness test result falls \noutside the prescribed limits, the entire lot of parts shall be \nreheat treated and the requirements of 9.5.1 shall apply. \n9.7 Fatigue Tests-When specified in the order, the fatigue \nstrength of alloy steel, except UNS K90901, components \nintended for service above 800 \u00b0P [425 \u00b0C] and for UNS \nK90901 components intended for service above 1000 \u00b0P \n[540 \u00b0C] shall be tested in accordance with the requirements of \nSupplementary Requirement S13. \n10. Product Analysis \n10.1 The purchaser is permitted to make a product analysis \non parts supplied to this specification. The chemical composi-\ntion of a sample from one part from each lot of parts shall be \ndetermined by the manufacturer. Samples for analysis shall be \ntaken from midway between the center and surface of solid \nparts, midway between the inner and outer surfaces of hollow \nparts, midway between the center and surface of full-size \nprolongations, or from broken mechanical test specimens. The \nchemical composition thus determined shall conform to Table \n1 with the tolerances as stated in Table 4 or Table 5. \nTABLE 4 Product Analysis Tolerances for Alloy Steels with a \nMaximum Chromium Limit 4 % or MoreA \nTolerance Over the \nElements Limit or Maximum of Specified Maximum Limit or \nRange,% Under the Minimum \nLimit \nCarbon 0.030, incl 0.005 \nover 0.030 to 0.20 incl 0.01 \nManganese to 1.00, incl 0.03 \nover 1.00 to 3.00, incl 0.04 \nPhosphorus to 0.040, incl 0.005 \nSulfur to 0.030, incl 0.005 \nSilicon to 1.00, incl 0.05 \nChromium over 4.00 to 10.00, incl 0.10 \nover 10.00 to 15.00, incl 0.15 \nNickel to 1.00, incl 0.03 \nover 1.00 to 5.00, incl 0.07 \nMolybdenum to 0.20 incl 0.01 \nover 0.20 to 0.60, incl 0.03 \nover 0.60 to 2.00, incl 0.05 \nTitanium all ranges 0.05 \nNiobium all ranges 0.05 \n(columbium) \n+ tantalum \nTantalum to 0.10, incl 0.02 \nCobalt 0.05 to 0.20, incl 0,01B \nNitrogen to 0.19 incl 0.01 \nNiobium 0.05 to 0.20, incl 0.01 \n(columbium) \nAluminum to 0.05 incl 0.01 \nVanadium to 0.10 incl 0.01 \nover 0.1 O to 0.25 incl 0.02 \nCerium 0.03 to 0.08 -0.005 \n+0.01 \nTungsten to 1.00, incl 0.04 \nCopper to 1.00, incl 0.03 \nA This table does not apply to heat analysis. \n8 Product analysis limits for cobalt under 0.05 % have not been established and \nthe producer should be consulted for those limits. \nTABLE 5 Product Analysis Tolerances for Alloy Steels with \nMaximum Chromium Limit Less than 4 % \nTolerance Over Maximum Limit or Under \nMinimum Limit for Size Ranges Shown, \nOfoA \nOver Over \n100 200 \n100 in.2 to 200 to 400 Limit or Maximum [6.45x in. 2 in. 2 Over \nElement 8 of Specified 10 4 mm\"] [1,290 [2.581 400 \nRanges,% or less X 10 5 X 10 6 in.2 \nmm 2 ], mm 2 ], \nincl incl \nManganese to 0.90 incl 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 \nover 0.90 to 1.00 incl 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 \nPhosphorus to 0.045 incl 0.005 0.010 0.010 0.010 \nSulfur to 0.045 Incl 0.005 0.010 0.010 0.010 \nSilicon to 0.40 incl 0.02 0.02 0.03 0.04 \nover 0.40 to 1.00 incl 0.05 0.06 0.06 0.07 \nNickel to 0.50 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.03 \nChromium to 0.90 incl 0.03 0.04 0.04 0.05 \nover 0.90 to 2.1 O incl 0.05 0.06 0.06 0.07 \nover 2.10 to 3.99 incl 0.10 0.10 0.12 0.14 \nMolybdenum to 0.20 incl 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.03 \nover 0.20 to 0.40 incl 0.02 0.03 0.03 0.04 \nover 0.40 to 1.15 incl 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 \nCopper to 1.00 incl 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.03 \nover 1.00 to 2.00 incl 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 \nTitanium to 0.10 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 \nVanadium to 0.10 incl 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 \n0.11 to 0.25 incl 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 \n0.26 to 0.50 incl 0.03 0.03 0.03 0.03 \nA Cross-sectional area. \n8 Product analysis for carbon, boron, niobium (columbium), and calcium shall \nconform to Table 1. \n11.
