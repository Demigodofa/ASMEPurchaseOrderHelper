TABLE 16 Permitted Variations in Cross Section for W, HP, S, M, C, and MC Shapes 
Norn 1-A is measured at center line of web for S, M, and Wand HP shapes; at back of web for C and MC shapes. Measurement is overall for C 
shapes under 3 in. B is measured parallel to flange. C is measured parallel to web. 
NOTE 2-Where " ... " appears in this table, there is no requirement.
