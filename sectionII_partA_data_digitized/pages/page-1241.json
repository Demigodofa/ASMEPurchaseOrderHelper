The test \ncoupon in Specification A1067/Al067M, Fig. 4 shall be \nemployed only for austenitic alloy castings with cross sections \nless than 2\u00bd in. [63.5 mm]. Tension test specimens shall be \nprepared in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions \nA370 or Test Methods Al058 as applicable. \n7.6 To determine conformance with the tension test \nrequirements, an observed value or calculated value shall be \nrounded off in accordance with Practice E29 to the nearest \n500 psi [5 MPa] for yield and tensile strength and to the nearest \n1 % for elongation and reduction of area. \n8. Repair by Welding \n8.1 Repair by welding shall be in accordance with the \nrequirements of individual specification using procedures and \nwelders qualified in accordance with Practice A488/A488M. \n9. Flanges \n9.1 When a flange from a flanged casting is removed to \nmake a weld end casting, discontinuities may be observed that \nwould not have been detrimental in a flanged casting. The \ndisposition of the casting shall be subject to agreement between \nthe purchaser and manufacturer. \n1155 \n! \n'\" ",
