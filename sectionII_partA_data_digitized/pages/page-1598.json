Description \n5.1 The tension test related to the mechanical testing of steel \nproducts subjects a machined or full-section specimen of the \nmaterial under examination to a measured load sufficient to \ncause rupture. The resulting properties sought are defined in \nTest Methods E8/E8M, ISO 6892-1, or JIS Z 2241 as appli\u00ad\ncable. \n5.2 In general, the testing equipment and methods are given \nin Test Methods E8/E8M, ISO 6892-1, and JIS Z 2241. \nHowever, there are certain exceptions to these practices; these \nexceptions are covered in this standard. \n6. Testing Apparatus and Operations \n6.1 Loading Systems-There are two general types of load\u00ad\ning systems, mechanical (screw power) and hydraulic. These \ndiffer chiefly in the variability of the rate of load application. \nThe older screw power machines are limited to a small number \nof fixed free running crosshead speeds. Some modern screw \npower machines, and all hydraulic machines permit stepless \nvariation throughout the range of speeds. \n6.2 The tension testing machine shall be maintained in good \noperating condition, used only in the proper loading range, and \ncalibrated periodically in accordance with the latest revision of \nthe appropriate practices. \nNoTE 2-Many machines are equipped with stress-strain recorders for \nautographic plotting of stress-strain curves. It should be noted that some \nrecorders have a load measuring component entirely separate from the \nload indicator of the testing machine. Such recorders are calibrated \nseparately. \n6.3 Loading-It is the function of the gripping or holding \ndevice of the testing machine to transmit the load from the \nheads of the machine to the specimen under test. The essential \nrequirement is that the load shall be transmitted axially. This \nimplies that the centers of the action of the grips shall be in \nalignment, insofar as practicable, with the axis of the specimen \nat the beginning and during the test and that bending and \ntwisting be held to a minimum. \n6.4 Speed of Testing-The speed of testing shall not be \ngreater than that at which load and strain readings can be made \naccurately. In production testing, speed of testing is commonly \nexpressed ( 1) in terms of free running crosshead speed (rate of \nmovement of the crosshead of the testing machine when not \nunder load), or (2) in terms of rate of separation of the two \nheads of the testing machine under load, or ( 3) in terms of rate \nof stressing the specimen, or ( 4) in terms of rate of straining the \nspecimen. The following limitations on the speed of testing are \nrecommended as adequate for most steel products: \nNOTE 3-Tension tests using closed-loop machines (with feedback \ncontrol of rate) should not be performed using load control, as this mode \nof testing will result in acceleration of the crosshead upon yielding and \nelevation of the measured yield strength. \n6.4.1 Any convenient speed of testing may be used up to \none half the specified yield point or yield strength. When this \npoint is reached, the free-running rate of separation of the \ncrossheads shall be adjusted so as not to exceed 0.025 mm per \nsecond per 25 mm of reduced section, or the distance between \nthe grips for test specimens not having reduced sections. This \nspeed shall be maintained through the yield point or yield \nstrength. In determining the tensile strength, the free-running \nrate of separation of the heads shall not exceed 13 mm per min \nper 25 mm of reduced section, or the distance between the \ngrips for test specimens not having reduced sections. In any \nevent, the minimum speed of testing shall not be less than 1/10 \nthe specified maximum rates for determining yield point or \nyield strength and tensile strength. \n6.4.2 It shall be permissible to set the speed of the testing \nmachine by adjusting the free running crosshead speed to the \nabove specified values, inasmuch as the rate of separation of \nheads under load at these machine settings is less than the \nspecified values of free running crosshead speed. \n6.4.3 As an alternative, if the machine is equipped with a \ndevice to indicate the rate of loading, the speed of the machine \nfrom half the specified yield point or yield strength through the \nyield point or yield strength may be adjusted so that the rate of \nstressing does not exceed 11 MPa per second. However, the \nminimum rate of stressing shall not be less than 1 MPa per \nsecond. \n7. Test Specimen Parameters \n7.1 Selection-Test coupons shall be selected in accordance \nwith the applicable product specifications. \n7.2 Size and Tolerances-Test specimen dimensions and \ntolerances shall comply with the requirements of the relevant \nstandards. \n7.3 Procurement of Test Specimens-Specimens shall be \nprepared from portions of the material. They are usually \nmachined so as to have a reduced cross section at mid-length \nin order to obtain uniform distribution of the stress over the \ncross section and to localize the zone of fracture. Care shall be \ntaken to remove by machining all distorted, cold-worked, or \nheat-affected areas from the edges of the section used in \nevaluating the test. \n7.4 Aging of Test Specimens-Unless otherwise specified, it \nshall be permissible to age tension test specimens. The time\u00ad\ntemperature cycle employed must be such that the effects of \nprevious processing will not be materially changed. It may be \naccomplished by aging at room temperature 24 to 48 h, or in \nshorter time at moderately elevated temperatures by boiling in \nwater, heating in oil or in an oven. \n7.5 Measurement of Dimensions of Test Specimens-Test \nspecimens shall be measured in accordance with the require\u00ad\nments of 7.5.1 and 7.5.2 for ASTM or the appropriate para\u00ad\ngraphs of ISO 6892-1 or JIS Z 2241, as applicable. \n7.5.1 Rectangular Tension Test-These forms of specimens \nare shown in Test Methods E8/E8M. To determine the cross\u00ad\nsectional area, the center width dimension shall be measured to \nthe nearest 0.15 mm for the 200-mm gauge length specimen \nand 0.025 mm for the 50-mm gauge length specimen. The \ncenter thickness dimension shall be measured to the nearest \n0.025 mm for both specimens. \n7.5.2 Round Tension Test Specimens-These forms of speci\u00ad\nmens are shown in Test Methods E8/E8M.
