Xl. DETERMINATION OF TEMPERATURE REDUCTIONS 
Xl.l Under the circumstances stated in 14.1.2, the impact 
test temperatures specified in Table 4 must be lowered. The 
following examples are offered to describe the application of 
the provisions of 14.1.2. 
Xl.1.1 When subsize specimens are used (see 10.1) and the 
width along the notch of the subsize specimen in 80 % or 
greater of the actual wall thickness of the original material, the 
provisions of 14.1.2 do not apply. 
Xl.1.1.l For example, if the actual wall thickness of pipe 
was 0.200 in. [5.0 mm] and the width along the notch of the 
largest subsize specimen obtainable is 0.160 in. [4 mm] or 
greater, no reduction in test temperature is required. 
Xl.1.2 When the width along the subsize specimen notch is 
less than 80 % of the actual wall thickness of the pipe, the 
required reduction in test temperature is computed by taking 
the difference between the temperature reduction values shown 
in Table 6 for the actual pipe thickness and the specimen width 
used. 
Xl.1.2.l For example, if the pipe were 0.262 in. [6.67 mm] 
thick and the width along the Charpy specimen notch was 3.33 
mm (1/3 standard size), the test temperature would have to be 
lowered by 25 °F [14 °C]. That is, the temperature reduction 
corresponding to the subsize specimen is 35 °F [19 °C]; the 
temperature reduction corresponding to the actual pipe thick­
ness is 10 °F [5 °C]; the difference between these two values is 
the required reduction in test temperature.
