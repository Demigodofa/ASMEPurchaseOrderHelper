A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope* \n1. 1 This specification 2 covers grades of average wall \nthickness, or, if specified on the order, minimum wall \nthickness, of stainless steel tubing for services requiring \ngeneral corrosion resistance, with particular emphasis on \nresistance to stress corrosion cracking. These steels are suscep\u00ad\ntible to embrittlement if used for prolonged periods at elevated \ntemperatures. \n1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. Within the text, the SI units are shown in \nbrackets. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the M \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \n1.3 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.

Ordering Information \n3 .1 Orders for product under this specification should in\u00ad\nclude the following, as required, to describe the desired \nmaterial adequately: \n3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), \n3.1.2 Name of product (seamless or welded tubes), \n3.1.3 Grade (see Table 1), \n3.1.4 Size (outside diameter and average wall thickness, \nunless minimum wall thickness is specified), \n3.1.5 Length (specific or random), \n3.1.6 Optional requirements (for product analysis, see Sec\u00ad\ntion 8; for hydrostatic or nondestructive electric test, see \nSection 10), \n3.1.7 Test report required (see the Inspection section of \nSpecification A1016/A1016M), \n3 .1. 8 Specification designation, and \n3.1.9 Special requirements. \n4. General Requirements \n4.1 Product furnished under this specification shall conform \nto the applicable requirements of Specification A1016/ \nA1016M, unless otherwise provided herein. \n5. Manufacture \n5.1 The tubes shall be made by the seamless or welded \nprocess with no filler metal added. \n6. Heat Treatment \n6.1 All tubes shall be furnished in the heat-treated condition \nin accordance with the procedures shown in Table 2. For \nseamless tubes, as an alternate to final heat treatment in a \ncontinuous furnace or batch-type furnace, immediately follow\u00ad\ning hot forming while the temperature of the tubes is not less \n4 Available from Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), 400 Commonwealth \nDr., Warrendale, PA 15096-0001, http://www.sae.org. \n* A Summary of Changes section appears at the end of this standard \n1286 ",
