surface with the major dimension of this area not to exceed 6 
in. [150 mm] when it is taken in the most unfavorable 
orientation relative to the indications being evaluated. 
S7. Magnetic Particle Examination of Weld Metal 
S7 .1 All accessible weld shall be examined in accordance 
with Practice E709. Accessible is defined as: All outside 
surfaces, all inside surfaces of pipe less than 24 in. [600 mm] 
in diameter for a distance of one pipe diameter from the ends.

tions are unacceptable: 
S7 .2.1 Any cracks and linear indications.

3/16 in. [5 mm]. 
S7.2.3 Four or more indications in any line separated 1/16 in. 
[l mm] or less edge-to-edge. 
S7.2.4 Ten or more indications in any 6 in.2 [39 cm 2 ] of 
surface with the major dimension of this area not to exceed 6 
in. [150 mm] when it is taken in the most unfavorable 
orientation relative to the indications being evaluated. 
S8. Liquid Penetrant Examination of Base Metal 
S8.1 All accessible surfaces of the pipe shall be examined in 
accordance with Test Method E165. Accessible is as defined in 
S6.1. 
S8.2 The acceptance criteria shall be in accordance with 
S6.2. 
S9. Liquid Penetrant Examination of Weld Metal 
S9.1 All accessible surfaces of the pipe shall be examined in 
accordance with Test Method E165. Accessible is as defined in 
S7.1 
S9.2 The acceptance criteria shall be in accordance with 
S7.2 
SlO. Straight Beam Ultrasonic Examination of Flat 
Plate-UT 1 
SlO.l The plate shall be examined and accepted in accor­
dance with Specification A435/ A435M except that 100 % of 
one surface shall be scanned by moving the search unit in 
parallel paths with not less than 10 % overlap. 
Sll. Straight Beam Ultrasonic Examination of Flat 
Plate-UT 2 
S 11.1 The plate shall be examined in accordance with 
Specification A578/A578M except that 100 % of one smface 
shall be scanned and the acceptance criteria shall be as follows: 
S 11.2 Any area, where one or more discontinuities produce 
a continuous total loss of back reflection accompanied by 
continuous indications on the same plane that cannot be 
encompassed within a circle whose diameter is 3 in. [75 mm] 
or ½ of the plate thickness, whichever is greater, is unaccept­
able. In addition, two or more discontinuities on the same plane 
and having the same characteristics but smaller than described 
above shall be unacceptable unless separated by a minimum 
distance equal to the largest diameter of the larger discontinuity 
or unless they may be collectively encompassed by the circle 
described above. 
S12. Angle-Beam Ultrasonic Examination (Plate Less than 
2 in. [50 mm)] Thick)-UT 3 
Sl2.1 The plate shall be examined in accordance with 
Specification A577 / A577M except that the calibration notch 
shall be V-shaped and the acceptance criteria shall be as 
follows: Any area showing one or more reflectors producing 
indications whose amplitude exceeds that of the calibration 
notch is unacceptable. 
S13. Repair Welding 
S 13 .1 Repair of base metal defects by welding shall be done 
only with customer approval. 
S14. Description of Term 
S 14.1 lot-all pipe of the same mill heat of plate material 
and wall thickness (within ±¼ in. [6 mm]) heat treated in one 
furnace charge. For pipe that is not heat treated or that is heat 
treated in a continuous furnace, a lot shall consist of each 200 
ft [60 m] or fraction thereof of all pipe of the same mill heat of 
plate material and wall thickness (within ±¼ in. [6 mm]), 
subjected to the same heat treatment. For pipe heat treated in a 
batch-type furnace that is automatically controlled within a 50 
°F [30 °C] range and is equipped with recording pyrometers so 
that heating records are available, a lot shall be defined the 
same as for continuous furnaces. 
S15. ASME Section III Construction 
S 15 .1 Products furnished under this specification that are 
intended for application under the rules of Section III of the 
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code shall be manufactured 
by holders of the appropriate ASME Certificate of Authoriza­
tion and Certification Mark. The product is subject to all 
applicable requirements of Section III, including welding, heat 
treatment, nondestructive examination, authorized inspection 
at the point of manufacture, and application of the Certification 
Mark. 
S15.2 The applicable ASME Partial Data Report form, 
signed by an Authorized Nuclear Inspector, and a material test 
report shall be furnished for each lot of pipe. 
S15.3 The plate used to fabricate the pipe shall conform to 
the applicable SA specification in ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code, Section II. The welded joints shall be full 
penetration butt welds as obtained by double welding or by 
other means that will obtain the same quality of deposited weld 
metal on the inside and outside. Welds using metal backing 
strips that remain in place are prohibited. 
S15.4 In addition to the requirements of S14 and Section 13 
(Product Marking), each length of pipe shall be so marked as 
to identify each such piece of pipe with the lot and the material 
test report.
