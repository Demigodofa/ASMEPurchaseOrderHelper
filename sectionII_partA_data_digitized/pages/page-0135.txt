TABLE S27.4 Permissible Variations from Flatness for High-Strength Low-Alloy Steel Plates As-Rolled or Normalized Ordered to 
Restrictive Flatness 
Norn I-Flatness Variations for Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and variation in flatness along the length shall not 
exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 3700 mm in length, or in any 3700 mm of longer plates. 
Norn 2-Flatness Variations for Width-The flatness vaiiation across the width shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width. 
Norn 3-When the longer dimension is under 900 mm, the variation in flatness along the length and across the width shall not exceed 10 mm in each 
direction. When the larger dimension is from 900 to 1800 mm, inclusive, the permissible flatness variation shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount 
for the specified width, but in no case less than 10 mm. 
Norn 4-This table and these notes cover the variations for flatness of circular and sketch plates based on the maximum dimensions of those plates. 
Norn 5-Waviness tolerances for rectangular plates, universal mill plates, and circular and sketch plates do not apply. 
Norn 6-A "Z" indicates that there is no published restricted value for the size. 
Norn 7-Plates shall in a ho1izontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured.
