3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A961/A961M, including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase 
order. Failure to comply with the requirements of Specification 
A961/A961M constitutes nonconformance with this specifica­
tion. In case of a conflict between the requirements of this 
specification and Specification A961/A961M, this specification 
shall prevail. 
3.2 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order all ordering information necessary to purchase 
the needed material. Examples of such information include but 
are not limited to the following: 
3.2.1 Additional requirements (see 16.1). 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 The steel shall be made by one or more of the following 
processes: open-hearth, basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace, and 
shall be fully killed, fine-grain practice. 
4.2 Forgings shall be manufactured froni ingots, blooms, 
billets, slabs, or bars. These items shall be forged, rolled, or 
strandcast. 
4.3 A sufficient discard shall be made from the ingot to 
secure freedom from injurious piping and undue segregation. 
4.4 The finished product shall be a forging as defined by the 
Terminology section of Specification A788/A788M. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 Following plastic working, the forging manufacturer 
shall heat treat the forgings by normalizing, or normalizing and 
tempering, or quenching and tempering. 
5.1.1 Normalizing-The procedure for normalizing shall 
consist of uniformly heating the forgings to a temperature 
between 1550 and 1700 °F [845 and 925 °C], holding a 
sufficient time to attain uniform temperature throughout, and 
cooling in still air. The forging shall be at a temperature below 
1000 °F [540 °C] before heating for normalizing. 
5.1.2 Quenching-The procedure for quenching shall con­
sist of uniformly heating the forging to a temperature between 
1550 and 1700 °P [845 and 925 °C], holding a sufficient time 
to attain uniform temperature throughout, and quenching into a 
suitable liquid medium. The forging shall be at a temperature 
below 1000 °F [540 °C] before heating for quenching. 
5 .1.3 Tempering-The procedure for tempering shall consist 
of reheating the forging subsequent to normalizing or quench­
ing to a temperature of at least 1100 °P [595 °C], but not above 
the lower transformation temperature, for 30 min/in. [30 
min/25 mm] of maximum section thickness, with minimum 
holding time at tempering temperature not less than 30 min. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
6.2 Steels to which lead has been added shall not be used. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7.1 Tension Tests: 
7. I. I Requirements-The material shall conform to require­
ments for tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. 
7 .1.1.1 The test specimen shall be obtained from a rough or 
finished production forging, or prolongation thereof, or it may 
be obtained from separately forged test blanks from the same 
heat of steel as the production forging. The test blank shall be 
reduced by forging in a manner similar to that for the products 
represented, shall receive approximately the same hot working 
and reduction, be of the same nominal thickness, and receive 
the same heat treatment as the finished products represented. 
The test material shall be treated in the same furnace at the 
same time as the forging it represents, subject to the require­
ments of 7 .1.2.1.
