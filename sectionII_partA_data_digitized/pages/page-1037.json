Manufacture \n4.1 Steelmaking Practice - The steel shall b~ killed \nand shall conform to the fine austenitic grain size require\u00ad\nment of Specification A 20/ A 20M. \n5. Heat Treatment \n5.1 All plates shall be heat treated by heating to a \nsuitable austenitizing temperature, holding for a sufficient \ntime period to attain uniform temperature through the thick\u00ad\nness and quenching in a suitable liquid medium by spraying \nor immersion. The plates shall then be tempered to produce \nthe required properties by heating to a suitable temperature \nnot lower than 1100\u00b0P [595\u00b0C] with a holding time of not \nless than \u00bd h/in. [1.2 min/mm] of thickness but not less \nthan\u00bd h. \n5.2 Plates over 4 in. [100 mm] in thickness shall receive \na prior treatment of normalizing at, or water quenching \nfrom a temperature within the range from 1650 to 1850\u00b0P \n[900 to 1010\u00b0C] before the heat treatment specified in 5.1. \n5.3 When the fabricator elects to perform the heat \ntreatment in 5.1 and 5.2, the manufacturer shall normalize \nthe plates at an appropriate temperature prior to shipment \nunless otherwise agreed to. \nTABLE 1 \nCHEMICAL REQUIREMENTS \nComposition, % \nElement \nCarbon, maxA \nManganese, maxA \nPhosphorus, maxA \nSulfur, maxA \nSilicon: \nType B \n0.20 \n0.40 \n0.020 \n0.020 \nType C \n0.18 \n0.40 \n0.020 \n0.020 \n6.
