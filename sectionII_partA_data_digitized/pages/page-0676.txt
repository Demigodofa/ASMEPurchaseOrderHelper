machine foundation bolts are not securely fastened, tests on 
ductile materials in the range of 80 ft•lbf (108 J) may actually 
indicate values in excess of 90 to 100 ft•lbf (122 to 136 J). 
AS.2 Notch Effect 
A5.2.1 The notch results in a combination of multiaxial 
stresses associated with restraints to deformation in directions 
perpendicular to the major stress, and a stress concentration at 
the base of the notch. A severely notched condition is generally 
not desirable, and it becomes of real concern in those cases in 
which it initiates a sudden and complete failure of the brittle 
type. Some metals can be deformed in a ductile manner even 
down to the low temperatures of liquid air, while others may 
crack. This difference in behavior can be best understood by 
considering the cohesive strength of a material (or the property 
that holds it together) and its relation to the yield point. In cases 
of brittle fracture, the cohesive strength is exceeded before 
significant plastic defonnation occurs and the fracture appears 
crystalline. In cases of the ductile or shear type of failure, 
considerable deformation precedes the final fracture and the 
broken surface appears fibrous instead of crystalline. In inter­
mediate cases the fracture comes after a moderate amount of 
deformation and is part crystalline and part fibrous in appear­
ance. 
AS.2.2 When a notched bar is loaded, there is a normal 
stress across the base of the notch which tends to initiate 
fracture. The property that keeps it from cleaving, or holds it 
together, is the "cohesive strength." The bar fractures when the 
normal stress exceeds the cohesive strength. When this occurs 
without the bar deforming it is the condition for brittle fracture. 
A5.2.3 In testing, though not in service because of side 
effects, it happens more commonly that plastic deformation 
precedes fracture. In addition to the normal stress, the applied 
load also sets up shear stresses which are about 45° to the 
normal stress. The elastic behavior terminates as soon as the 
shear stress exceeds the shear strength of the material and 
deformation or plastic yielding sets in. This is the condition for 
ductile failure. 
A5.2.4 This behavior, whether brittle or ductile, depends on 
whether the normal stress exceeds the cohesive strength before 
the shear stress exceeds the shear strength. Several important 
facts of notch behavior follow from this. If the notch is made 
sharper or more drastic, the normal stress at the root of the 
notch will be increased in relation to the shear stress and the 
bar will be more prone to brittle fracture ( see Table AS .1 ). Also, 
as the speed of deformation increases, the shear strength 
increases and the likelihood of brittle fracture increases. On the 
other hand, by raising the temperature, leaving the notch and 
the speed of deformation the same, the shear strength is 
lowered and ductile behavior is promoted, leading to shear 
failure. 
A5.2.5 Variations in notch dimensions will seriously affect 
the results of the tests. Tests on B4340 s_teel specimens have 
shown the effect of dimensional variations on Charpy results 
(see Table A5.l). 
AS.3 Size Effect 
A5.3.l Increasing either the width or the depth of the 
specimen tends to increase the volume of metal subject to 
distortion, and by this factor tends to increase the energy 
absorption when breaking the specimen. However, any in­
crease in size, particularly in width, also tends to increase the 
degree of restraint and by tending to induce brittle fracture, 
may decrease the amount of energy absorbed. Where a 
standard-size specimen is on the verge of brittle fracture, this is 
particularly true, and a double-width specimen may actually 
require less energy for rupture than one of standard width. 
AS.3.2 In studies of such effects where the size of the 
material precludes the use of the standard specimen, as for 
example when the material is ¼-in. plate, subsize specimens 
are necessarily used. Such specimens (see Fig. 6 of Test 
Methods E23) are based on the Type A specimen of Fig. 4 of 
Test Methods E23. 
AS.3.3 General correlation between the energy values ob­
tained with specimens of different size or shape is not feasible, 
but limited correlations may be established for specification 
purposes on the basis of special studies of particular materials 
and particular specimens. On the other hand, in a study of the 
relative effect of process variations, evaluation by use of some 
arbitrarily selected specimen with some chosen notch will in 
most instances place the methods in their proper order. 
AS.4 Effects of Testing Conditions 
AS.4.1 The testing conditions also affect the notch behavior. 
So pronounced is the effect of temperature on the behavior of 
steel when notched that comparisons are frequently made by
