A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A \nsuperscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification covers requirements for a high \nstrength drawn and cold rolled steel wire in two strength \nclasses, with rectangular cross section, and round mill edge. \nThis wire is intended for prestressed vessel and press frame \nwindings. \n1.2 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \n(metric) units are to be regarded separately as standards. \nWithin the text and tables, the SI units are shown in parenthe\u00ad\nses. The values stated in each system are not exact equivalents. \nTherefore, each system must be used independent of the other. \nCombining values from the two systems may result in noncon\u00ad\nformance with the specification. \n1.3 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.

No. 123 Marking for Shipment (Civil Agencies) \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 It shall be the responsibility of the purchaser to specify \nall requirements that are necessary for material under this \nspecification. Such requirements may include, but are not \nlimited to, the following: \n3.1.1 Quantity (mass), \n3.1.2 Name of material, \n3.1.3 Dimensions (see Section 7), \n3.1.4 Finish (see Section 8), \n3.1.5 Packaging (see Section 11), \n3.1.6 Cast or heat analysis report (see Section 5), \n3.1.7 Number of certification or test reports required (see \nSection 10), \n3.1.8 ASTM designation and year of issue, and \n3.1.9 Supplementary requirements, if any. \n4. Material and Manufacture \n4.1 The steel shall be produced by any of the following \nprimary processes: (1) basic oxygen, and (2) electric furnace or \nvacuum induction (VIM). The primary melting may incorpo\u00ad\nrate separate degassing or refining and may be followed by \nsecondary melting by the electrode slag process (ESR) or the \nvacuum arc remelting process (VAR). \n4.1.1 The steel may be ingot cast or continuously cast. \n4.2 The finished wire shall be free from detrimental pipe \nand undue segregation. \n4.3 The wire shall be cold drawn or cold rolled, or both, to \nproduce the desired mechanical properties and dimensions \nafter subjecting it to the patenting treatment. \n4.4 The width to thickness ratio of the wire cross section \nshall not exceed 8. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5 .1 The steel shall conform to the requirements for chemical \ncomposition prescribed in Table 1. \n3 Available from Standardization Documents Order Desk, DODSSP, Bldg. 4, \nSection D, 700 Robbins Ave., Philadelphia, PA 19111-5094, https:// \nquicksearch.dla.mil. \n* A Summary of Changes section appears at the end of this standard \n1376 ",
