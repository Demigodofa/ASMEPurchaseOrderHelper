SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
Supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the order. 
A list of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser are included 
in Specification A20/A20M. Several of those considered suitable for use with this specification are 
listed in this section by title. Other tests may be performed by agreement between the supplier and the 
purchaser.
