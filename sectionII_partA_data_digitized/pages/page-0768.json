Scope \n1.1 This specification covers stainless and alloy-steel bolt\u00ad\ning material and bolting components specially heat treated for \nhigh-temperature service, such as steam turbine, gas turbine, \nand similar uses. See Specification A962/A962M for the \ndefinition of bolting. This material requires special processing \nand should not be used in general-purpose applications. Bolt\u00ad\ning furnished as bars shall be hot wrought and may be further \nprocessed by centerless grinding or by cold drawing. \n1.2 The high-temperature properties of the bolting materials \nand components covered by this specification are dependent \nupon special heat treatment, which is required. Although the \nhigh-temperature properties are not specified, they are implied \nby control of the chemistry, heat treatment, and room\u00ad\ntemperature properties of the bolting material. \n1.3 Three levels of bolting strength are covered, designated \nGrades B4B, B4C, and B4D. \n1.4 The following referenced general requirements are in\u00ad\ndispensable for application of this specification: Specification \nA962/ A962M. \n1.5 Supplementary requirements are provided for use at the \noption of the purchaser. The supplementary requirements shall \napply only when specified individually by the purchaser in the \npurchase order or contract. \n1.6 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units \nand in SI units; however, unless the purchase order or contract \nspecifies the applicable M specification designation (SI units), \nthe inch-pound units shall apply. \n1. 7 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \n718 \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. \n1.8 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA962/A962M Specification for Common Requirements for \nBolting Intended for Use at Any Temperature from Cryo\u00ad\ngenic to the Creep Range \nE292 Test Methods for Conducting Time-for-Rupture Notch \nTension Tests of Materials \nE112 Test Methods for Determining Average Grain Size \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 It shall be the responsibility of the purchaser to specify \nall requirements necessary for product under this specification. \nSuch requirements to be considered include, but are not limited \nto, the following: \n3.1.1 Specification designation, grade, issue date, and revi-\nsion letter, \n3.1.2 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), \n3.1.3 Description (bars, bolts, nuts, etc.), \n3.1.4 Dimensions, \n3.1.S Finish, and \n3.1.6 Impact testing of nuts, if required (see Section 8). \n4. Common Requirements \n4.1 Bolting materials and bolting components supplied to \nthis specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci\u00ad\nfication A962/ A962M. These requirements include test ",
