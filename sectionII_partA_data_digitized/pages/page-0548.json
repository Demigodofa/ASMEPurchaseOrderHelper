Impact Requirements \n12.1 For Grades 1, 3, 6, 7 and 9, the notched-bar impact \nproperties of each set of three impact specimens, including \nspecimens for the welded joint in welded pipe with wall \nthicknesses of0.120 in. [3 mm] and larger, when tested at \ntemperatures in conformance with 14.1 shall be not less \nthan the values prescribed in Table 5. The impact test is \nnot required for Grade 11. \n12.1.1 If the impact value of one specimen is below \nthe minimum value, or the impact values of two specimens \nare less than the minimum average value but not below \nthe minimum value permitted on a single specimen, a retest \nshall be allowed. The retest shall consist of breaking three \nadditional specimens and each specimen must equal or \nexceed the required average value. When an erratic result \nis caused by a defective specimen, or there is uncertainty \nin test procedures, a retest will be allowed. \n12.2 For Grade 8 each of the notched bar impact speci\u00ad\nmens shall display a lateral expansion opposite the notch \nnot less than 0.Gl5 in. [0.38 mm]. \u2022 \n12.2.1 When the average lateral expansion value for \nthe three impact specimens equals or exceeds 0.015 in. \n[0.38 mm] and the value for one specimen is below \n0.015 in. [0.38 mm] but not below 0.010 in. [0.25 mm], \na retest of three additional specimens may be made. The \nlateral expansion of each of the retest specimens must equal \nor exceed 0.015 in. [0.38 mm]. \n12.2.2 Lateral expansion values shall be determined \nin accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. \n12.2.3 The values of absorbed energy in foot-pounds \nand the fracture appearance in percentage shear shall be \nrecorded for information. A record of these values shall \nbe retained for a period of at least 2 years. \n13. Mechanical Tests \n13.1 Tension Test - One tension test shall be made on \na specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension \ntests shall be made on specimens from two tubes for lots \nof more than 50 tubes. \n13.2 Flattening Test - One flattening test shall be made \non specimens from each end of one finished tube of each \nlot but not the one used for the flare or flange test. \n13.3 Flare Test (Seamless Tubes)- One flare test shall \nbe made on specimens from each end of one finished tube \nof each lot, but not the one used for the flattening test. \n13.4 Flange Test (Welded Tubes) - One flange test \nshall be made on specimens from each end of one finished \ntube of each lot, but not the one used for the flattening test. \n13.5 Reverse Flattening Test - For welded tubes, one \nreverse flattening test shall be made on a specimen from \neach 1500 ft [460 m] of finished tubing. \n13.6 Hardness Test - Brinell or Rockwell hardness \ntests shall be made on specimens from two tubes from \neach lot. \n13.7 Impact Tests - One notched-bar impact test, con\u00ad\nsisting of breaking three specimens, shall be made from \neach heat represented in a heat-treatment load on specimens \ntaken from the finished tube. This test shall represent only \ntubes from the same heat, which have wall thicknesses not \nexceeding by more than\u00bc in. [6.3 mm] the wall thicknesses \nof the tube from which the test specimens are taken. If \nheat treatment is performed in continuous or batch-type \nfurnaces controlled within a 50\u00b0F [30\u00b0C] range and \nequipped with recording pyrometers which yield complete \nheat-treatment records, then one test from each heat in a \ncontinuous run only shall be required instead of one test \nfrom each heat in each heat-treatment load. \n13.8 Impact Tests (Welded Tubes) - On welded tube, \nadditional impact tests of the same number as required in \n13.7 shall be made to test the weld. \n13.9 Specimens showing defects while being machined \nor prior to testing may be discarded and replacements shall \nbe considered as original specimens. \n496 \n14. Specimens for Impact Test \n14.1 Notched-bar impact specimens shall be of the \nsimple beam, Charpy-type, in accordance with Test Meth\u00ad\nods E 23, Type A, with a V notch. Standard specimens 10 \nby 10 mm in cross section shall be used unless the material \nto be tested is of insufficient thickness, in which case the \nlargest obtainable subsize specimens shall be used. Charpy \nspecimens of width along the notch larger than 0.394 in. \n[10 mm] or smaller than 0.099 in. [2.5 mm] are not provided \nfor in this specification. \n14.2 Test specimens shall be obtained so that the longi\u00ad\ntudinal axis of the specimen is parallel to the longitudinal \naxis of the tube while the axis of the notch shall be perpen\u00ad\ndicular to the surface. On wall thicknesses of 1 in. [25 mm] \nor less, the specimens shall be obtained with their axial \nplane located at the midpoint; on wall thicknesses over 1 \nin. [25 mm], the specimens shall be obtained with their \naxial plane located\u00bd in. [12.5 mm] from the outer surface. \n14.3 When testing welds the specimen shall be, when\u00ad\never diameter and thickness permits, transverse to the lon\u00ad\ngitudinal axis of the tube with the notch of the specimen ",
