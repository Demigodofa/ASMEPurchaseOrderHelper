Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and \nshall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of \nSpecification A20/A20M. \n5. Heat Treatment \n5.1 Grade D plates of all thicknesses and Grade C plates of \nthicknesses over 2 in. [50 mm] shall be normalized. \n5.2 Grade C plates 2 in. [50 mm] and under in thickness are \nusually supplied in the as-rolled condition. The plates may be \nordered normalized or stress-relieved, or both. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements \ngiven in Table 1, unless otherwise modified in accordance with \n313 \nSupplementary Requirement Sl7, Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized \nSteel, in Specification A20/ A20M. \n7. Mechanical Properties \n7 .1 Tension Test-The plates, as represented by the tension \ntest specimens, shall conform to the requirements given in \nTable 2. \n7.2 For plates with a nominal thickness of% in.
