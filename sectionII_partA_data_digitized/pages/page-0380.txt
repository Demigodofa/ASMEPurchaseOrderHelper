INTERNATIONAi. 
Standard Specification for 
Piping Fittings of Wrought Carbon Steel and Alloy Steel for 
Moderate and High Temperature Service 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A234/A234M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers wrought carbon steel and 
alloy steel fittings of seamless and welded construction covered 
by the latest revision of ASME B16.9, B16.11, MSS-SP-79, 
MSS-SP-83, MSS-SP-95, and MSS-SP-97. These fittings are 
for use in pressure piping and in pressure vessel fabrication for 
service at moderate and elevated temperatures. Fittings differ­
ing from these ASME and MSS standards shall be furnished in 
accordance with Supplementary Requirement S58 of Specifi­
cation A960/ A960M. 
1.2 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for 
fittings where a greater degree of examination is desired. When 
desired, one or more of these supplementary requirements may 
be specified in the order. 
1.3 This specification does not cover cast welding fittings or 
fittings machined from castings. Cast steel welding fittings are 
governed by Specifications A216/A216M and A217/A217M. 
1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee A0l on Steel, 
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee 
A0l.22 on Steel Forgings and Wrougbt Fittings for Piping Applications and Bolting 
Materials for Piping and Special Purpose Applications.
