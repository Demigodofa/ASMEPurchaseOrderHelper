6.1.2.2 For studs, bolts, screws, etc., one tension test and 
one set of three impact specimens shall be made for each 
diameter of each heat involved in the lot. Each lot shall consist 
of the following: 
Diameter, in. (mm] Lot Size, lb [kg] 
11/s [30] and under 1500 (680] or fraction thereof 
Over 11/s (30] to 1 ¾ [ 45], 4500 (2040] or fraction 
incl thereof 
Over 1¾ (45] to 2½ (65], 6000 [2700] or fraction 
incl thereof 
Over 2½ (65] 100 pieces or fraction thereof 
6.1.2.3 Full Size Specimens, Headed Bolting Components­
Headed bolts or screws 1 ½ in. in body diameter and smaller, 
with body length three times the diameter or longer, and that 
are produced by upsetting or forging (hot or cold) shall be 
subjected to full size testing in accordance with 6.1.3. This 
testing shall be in addition to tensile testing as specified in 
6.1.1. Wedge tensile testing shall be limited to product with 
socket head cap screw, hexagon, square, hex flange, or twelve 
point flange heads. The lot size shall be shown in 6.1.2.2. 
Failure shall occur in the body or threaded section with no 
failure, or indications of failure, such as cracks, at the junction 
of the head and shank. Wedge tensile testing is not required for 
flat countersunk head or socket button products. 
6.1.3 Full Size Bolting Components, Wedge Tensile 
Testing-When applicable, see 6.1.2.3. Headed components 
shall be wedge tested full size. The minimum full size load 
applied (lbf or kN) for individual sizes shall be as follows: 
W= T., XA, (1) 
where: 
w 
Ts 
A1 
= 
= 
= 
minimum wedge tensile load without fracture, 
tensile strength specified in ksi or MPa in Tables 2 and 
3, and 
stress area of the thread section, square inches or square 
millimetres, as shown in the Cone Proof Load Tables in 
Specification A962/A962M. 
6.2 Impact Properties: 
6.2.1 Requirements: 
6.2.1.1 Impact tests are required for the grades shown in 
Table 3. Class 1, lA, and 2 austenitic steels for temperatures 
above -325 °F [-200 °C]; Class 1 and IA austenitic Grades BS, 
BSA, BSP, BSPA, BSC, BSCA, BSLN, and BSLNA above 
-425 °F [-255 °C]; and ferritic or austenitic bolting½ in. [12.5 
mm] and smaller, are exempt from impact testing, unless 
Supplementary Requirement Sl is specified in the purchase 
order (see 1.4). All other material furnished under this speci­
fication shall be tested. Material of Grades L 7, L 7 A, L 7B, L 7C, 
L7M, L43, L70, L71, L72, and L73 shall show a minimum 
impact energy absorption of 20 ft • lbf [27 J] and of Grade LI 
a minimum impact energy absorption of 40 ft - lbf [54 J] at the 
specified test temperature. 
6.2.1.2 The temperature of the coolant used for chilling the 
test specimens shall be controlled within ±2 °F [l 0 C]. Test 
temperatures for ferritic grades are listed in Table 2. Excep­
tions to this requirement are permissible, and the impact tests 
may be made at specified temperatures different than those 
shown in Table 2, provided the test temperature is at least as 
low as the intended service temperature and the bolting is 
suitably marked to identify the reported test temperature. When 
impact testing is required for austenitic grades, test criteria 
shall be agreed upon between the supplier and purchaser. 
6.2.1.3 The impact test requirements for standard and sub­
size Charpy V-notch (CVN) test specimens are prescribed in 
Table 2. If the material is impact tested at a temperature lower 
than the specified test temperature with impact energy absorp­
tion results equal to or greater than the specified required 
impact energy absorption for that product, the material can be 
considered suitable for the specified test temperature. 
NoTE 2-As an example, the purchase order or contract requires an 
L-g:rade bolt to have an average 15 ft-lbs at -50 °F. If the Charpy V-notch 
testing indicates that the bolting material passes at -100 °F and if it also 
meets other mechanical property or other environmental resistance 
requirements, it is permissible or suitable for use if that specified 
temperature reflects the rninimum anticipated temperature range to which 
that the product or application will be subjected. 
6.2.2 Number of Tests: 
6.2.2.1 The test requirements for heat-treated bars are given 
in 6.1.2.1. 
6.2.2.2 For test requirements on studs, bolts, screws, etc., 
see 6.1.2.2. 
6.2.2.3 Impact tests are not required to be made on heat­
treated bars, bolts, screws, studs, and stud bolts ½ in. [12.5 
mm] and under in diameter. 
469 
6.2.3 Test Specimens-For sections 1 in. [25 mm] or less in 
diameter, test specimens shall be taken at the axis; for sections 
over 1 in. [25 mm] in diameter, midway between the axis and 
the surface. 
6.3 Hardness Requirements: 
6.3.1 The hardness shall conform to the requirements pre­
scribed in Table 1. Hardness testing shall be performed in 
accordance with either Specification A962/A962M or with Test 
Methods F606/F606M. 
6.3.2 The maximum hardness of Grade L7M shall be 235 
HBW or 99 HRB. Minimum hardness shall not be less than 200 
HBW or 93 HRB. Conformance to this hardness shall be 
ensured by testing each bolt or stud by Brinell or Rockwell B 
methods in accordance with 6.3.1. 
6.3.2.1 The use of 100 % electromagnetic testing for hard­
ness as an alternative to 100 % indentation hardness testing is 
permissible when qualified by sampling using indentation 
hardness testing. Each lot tested for hardness electromagneti­
cally shall be 100 % examined in accordance with Practice 
E566. Following electromagnetic testing for hardness, a ran­
dom sample of a minimum of 100 pieces in each purchase lot 
(as defined in 6.1.2.2) shall be tested by indentation hardness 
methods. All samples must meet hardness requirements to 
permit acceptance of the lot. If any one sample is outside of the 
specified maximum or minimum hardness, the lot shall be 
rejected and either reprocessed and resampled, or tested 100 % 
by indentation hardness methods. 
6.3.2.2 In the event a controversy exists relative to mini­
mum strength, tension tests shall prevail over hardness read­
ings. Products which have been tested and found acceptable 
shall have a line under the grade symbol.
