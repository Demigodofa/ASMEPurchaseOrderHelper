fluid to leak through the tube wall and may be either visually 
seen or detected by a loss of pressure. This test may not detect 
very tight, through-the-wall defects or defects that extend an 
appreciable distance into the wall without complete penetra­
tion. 
26.2.6 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
products. 
26.3 Time of Examination-Nondestructive examination for 
specification acceptance shall be performed after all deforma­
tion processing, heat treating, welding, and straightening op­
erations. This requirement does not preclude additional testing 
at earlier stages in the processing. 
26.4 Surface Condition: 
26.4.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, paint, 
or other foreign material that could interfere with interpretation 
of test results. The methods used for cleaning and preparing the 
surfaces for examination shall not be detrimental to the base 
metal or the surface finish. 
26.4.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can 
produce signals that interfere with the test. 
26.5 Extent of Examination: 
26.5.l The relative motion of the tube and the transducer(s), 
coil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire tube smiace is 
scanned, except for end effects as noted in 26.5.2. 
26.5.2 The existence of end effects is recognized, and the 
extent of such effects shall be determined by the manufacturer, 
and, if requested, shall be reported to the purchaser. Other 
nondestructive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
26.6 Operator Qualifications: 
26.6.1 The test unit operator shall be certified in accordance 
with SNT-TC-lA, or an equivalent documented standard 
agreeable to both purchaser and manufacturer. 
26.7 Test Conditions: 
26.7.1 For examination by the ultrasonic method, the mini­
mum nominal transducer frequency shall be 2.0 MHz, and the 
maximum transducer size shall be 1.5 in. [38 mm]. 
26.7.2 For eddy current testing, the excitation coil fre­
quency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration, yet 
provide good signal-to-noise ratio. 
26.7.2.1 The maximum coil frequency shall be: 
Specified Wall Thickness 
<0.050 in. 
0.050 to 0.150 
>0.150 
26.8 Reference Standards: 
Maximum Frequency 
100 KHz 
50 
10 
26.8.1 Reference standards of convenient length shall be 
prepared from a length of tube of the same grade, specified size 
(outside diameter and wall thickness), surface finish and heat 
treatment condition as the tubing to be examined. 
26.8.2 For eddy current testing, the reference standard shall 
contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following discontinuities: 
26.8.2.1 Drilled Hole-The reference standard shall contain 
three or more holes, equally spaced circumferentially around 
the tube and longitudinally separated by a sufficient distance to 
allow distinct identification of the signal from each hole. The 
holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the tube 
wall, with care being taken to avoid distortion of the tube while 
drilling. The holes shall not be larger than 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] 
in diameter. As an alternative, the producer may choose to drill 
one hole and run the calibration standard through the test coil 
three times, rotating the tube approximately 120° each time. 
More passes with smaller angular increments may be used, 
provided testing of the full 360° of the coil is obtained. For 
welded tubing, if the weld is visible, one of the multiple holes 
or the single hole shall be drilled in the weld. 
26.8.2.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool 
or file with a ¼ in. [6.4 mm] diameter, a notch shall be milled 
or filed tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the tube. Said notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. 
26.8.2.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
tube axis on the outside surface of the tube, to have a depth not 
exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
26.8.3 For ultrasonic testing, the reference ID and OD 
notches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes 
shown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The 
depth of the notches shall not exceed 12½ % of the specified 
wall thickness of the tube or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is 
greater. The width of the notch shall not exceed two times the 
depth. For welded tubing, the notches shall be placed in the 
weld, if the weld is visible. 
26.8.4 For flux leakage testing, the longitudinal reference 
notches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a radial 
plane parallel to the tube axis on the inside and outside surfaces 
of the tube. Notch depth shall not exceed 12½ % of the 
specified wall thickness or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is 
greater. Notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25.4 mm], and the 
width shall not exceed the depth. Outside and inside notches 
shall have sufficient separation to allow distinct identification 
of the signal from each notch. 
744 
26.8.5 More or smaller reference discontinuities, or both, 
may be used by agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
26.9 Standardization Procedure: 
26.9.1 The test apparatus shall be standardized at the 
beginning and end of each series of tubes of the same specified 
size (diameter and wall thickness), grade and heat treatment 
condition, and at intervals not exceeding 4 h during the 
examination of such tubing. More frequent standardizations 
may be performed at the manufacturer's option or may be 
required upon agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
26.9.2 The test apparatus shall also be standardized after 
any change in test system settings, change of operator, equip­
ment repair, or intem1ption due to power loss or shutdown.
