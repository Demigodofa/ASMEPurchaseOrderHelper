3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions: 
3.1.1 For definitions of terms pertaining to this standard, not 
otherwise listed in 3.2, reference should be made to Terminol­
ogy A941. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.1 cold work, n-the changing of mechanical properties 
by work hardening. 
3.2.2 plate, n-material 3/16 in. [5.00 mm] and over in 
thickness and over 10 in. [250 mn:i-] in width; finishes for plate 
are shown in Section.13. 
3,2.3 sheet, n-material under 3/16 in. [5.00 mm] in thickness 
and 24 in. [600 mm] and over in width; finishes for sheet are 
shown in Section 11. 
3.2.4 strip, n-cold-rolled material under 3/16 in. [5.00 mm] 
in thickness and under 24 in. [600 mm] in width; finishes are 
detailed in Section 12 for strip, and strip edges in Section 14 
for cold-rolled strip. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material ordered under this 
specification. Such requirements may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (weight and number of pieces), 
4.1.2 Name of material (stainless steel), 
4.1.3 Condition (hot-rolled, cold-rolled, annealed, heat­
treated), 
4.1.4 Finish (see Section 11 for sheet, Section 12 for strip, 
and Section 13 for plates); in the case of polished finishes, 
specify whether one or both sides are to be polished,

4.1.5 Temper (if the applicable material specification re-
quires this detail), 
4.1.6 Form (plate, sheet, or strip), 
4.1.7 Dimensions (thickness, width, and length), 
4.1. 7 .1 Thickness shall be ordered to decimal or fractional 
thickness. The use of the gauge number is discouraged as being 
an archaic term of limited usefulness not having general 
agreement on meaning. The gauge number shall not be a basis 
• for rejection. 
4.1.7.2 Thickness, width, and length, when applicable, 
should be ordered in the same units, for example, 0.060 in. by 
48 in. by 120 in. [1.52 mm by 1219 mm by 3048 mm]. 
4.1.8 Edge, strip only (see Section 14 for cold-rolled strip), 
4.1.9 Type or UNS designation, refer to the applicable 
material specification, 
4.1.10 Specification designation and date of issue, 
4.1.11 Additions to specification or special requirements, 
4.1.12 Restrictions (if desired) on methods for determining 
yield strength (see appropriate footnote to mechanical proper­
ties table of the basic material specification), 
4.1.13 Marking requirements (see Section 25), 
4.1.14 Preparation for delivery (see Section 25), and 
4.1.15 Magnetic permeability test (when required). Refer to 
Section 19. 
5. Process 
5.1 The steel shall be manufactured/produced by the follow­
ing or as specified in the applicable material specification. 
5.1.1 The steel shall be made by electric-arc, electric­
induction, or other suitable processes. 
5.1.2 If a specific type of meltip.g is required by the 
purchaser, it shall be so specified on the purchase order. 
6. Heat Analysis 
6.1 Methods and practices· relating to chemical analysis 
shall be in accordance with Test . Methods, Practices, and 
Terminology A751. 
6.2 An analysis of each heat shall be made by the steel 
producer to determine the percentages of the elements specified 
in the applicable material specification. This analysis shall be 
made from a test sample taken during the pouring of the melt, 
or from the in-process product later in the manufacturing flow. 
6.2.1 The heat analysis shall conform to the chemical 
requirements for each of the specified elements for the grade 
ordered, as listed in the applicable product specification. 
6.2.2 All commercial metals contain small amounts of 
elements other than those which are specified. It is neither 
practical nor necessary to specify limits for unspecified ele­
ments that can be present. The producer is permitted to analyze 
for unspecified elements and is permitted to report such 
analyses. The presence of an unspecified element and the 
reporting of an analysis for that element shall not be a basis for 
rejection, unless the presence of that element causes the loss of 
a property typically expected for that metal, for the type and 
quality ordered. 
6.2.3 The purchaser is permitted to require in the purchase 
order a maximum limit for an individual element not specified 
in the product specification. Such a requirement for an element
