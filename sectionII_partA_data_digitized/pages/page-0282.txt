SA-192/SA-192M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Seamless Carbon Steel Boiler Tubes for High-Pressure 
Service 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
seamless carbon steel boiler and superheater tubes for high­
pressure service. 
1.2 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are½ in. to 7 in. [12.7 to 177.8 mm] outside 
diameter and 0.085 to 1.000 in. [2.2 to 25.4 mm], inclusive, in 
minimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may 
be furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] inside diameter or 0.015 in. 
[0.4 mm] thickness. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Inforination 
3 .1 Orders for material under this specification should 
include the following, as required, to describe the desired 
material adequately: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material (seamless tubes), 
3.1.3 Manufacture (hot-finished or cold-finished), 
3.1.4 Size (outside diameter and minimum wall thickness), 
3.1.5 Length (specific or random), 
3.1.6 Optional requirements (Sections 8.1 and 10.4), 
3.1.7 Test report required (see section on Certification of 
Specification A450/ A450M), 
3.1.8 Specification designation, and 
3 .1.9 Special requirements. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A450/A450M, unless otherwise provided herein. 
S. Manufacture 
5 .1 Tubes shall be made by the seamless process and shall 
be either hot-finished or cold-finished, as specified. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 Hot-finished tubes need not be heat treated. Cold­
finished tubes shall be heat treated after the final cold-finishing 
at a temperature of 1200°F [650°C] or higher.
