6.4 Grades 2H, 2HM, 3, 6, 6F, 7, 7M, 43, and 16 nuts shall 
be hot- or cold-forged or shall be machined from hot-forged, 
hot-rolled, or cold-drawn bars and shall be heat treated to meet 
the required mechanical properties. These grades shall be 
uniformly reheated to the proper austenitizing temperature (a 
group thus reheated being known as a quenching charge) and 
quenched under substantially uniform conditions for each 
quenching charge and tempered as shown below. Grades 2H, 
, 2HM, 3, 7, and 7M shall be liquid quenched. Grades 6 and 6F 
shall be quenched in liquid or inert gas. Grade 16 shall be 
heated to a temperature range from 1700 to 1750 °F (925 to 
955 °C) and oil quenched.

Nuts machined from bar heat treated in accordance with this 
specification need not be reheat-treated. For Grade 2HM and 
7M nuts, a final stress relief shall be done at or above the 
minimum tempering temperature after all forming, machining, 
and tapping operations. This final stress relief may be the 
tempering operation. 
6.4.1 Grade 6 and 6F nuts shall be tempered for a minimum 
of 1 h at the temperature.

8MN, 8R, 8S, 8LN, 8MLN, 8MLCuN, 8ML4CuN, and 9C nuts 
shall be hot or cold forged, or shall be machined from 
hot-forged, hot-rolled or cold-drawn bars. 
6.6 Grades 8A, SCA, 8CLNA, 8CLNCuBA, 8MA, STA, 
8FA, 8PA, 8NA, 8MNA, 8RA, 8SA, 8LNA, 8MLNA,

cold-forged or shall be machined from hot-forged, hot-rolled, 
or cold-drawn bars and the nuts shall subsequently be carbide­
solution treated by heating them for a sufficient time at a 
temperature to dissolve chromium carbides followed by cool­
ing at a rate sufficient to prevent reprecipitation of the carbides. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 Each alloy shall conform to the chemical composition 
requirements prescribed in Table 1. 
8. Mechanical Requirements 
8.1 Hardness Test: 
8.1.1 Requirements: 
8.1.1.1 All nuts shall meet the hardness requirements speci­
fied in Table 2. 
8.1.1.2 Sample nuts of Grades 1, 2, 2H, 2HM, 3, 7, 7M, 43, 
and 16 which have been given the treatment described in 8.1.5 
shall meet the minimum hardness specified in Table 2. 
8.1.2 Number of Tests-(Grades 1, 2, 2H, 3, 7, 43, and 16 
and all types of Grade 6): 
8.1.2.1 Tests on the number of sample nuts in accordance 
with the following table shall be performed by the manufac­
turer following all production heat treatments: 
Lot Size Samples 
~~~ 1 
801 to 8000 2 
8001 to 22 000 3 
Over22 000 5 
8.1.2.2 In addition, a hardness test shall be performed by the 
manufacturer in accordance with 8.1.5 on one sample nut 
selected from each nominal diameter and series from each 
grade and heat number following completion of all production 
heat treatments. 
8.1.3 Number of Tests, Grades 2HM and 7M: 
8.1.3.1 Each nut shall be tested in accordance with either 
Specification A962/A962M or with Test Methods F606/F606M
