Paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2 have been revised to refer to Table S 1. 1 and para. 6.3 has been deleted.) \n1. Scope \n1.1 This specification covers the requirements for \nquenched and tempered alloy steel hexagon socket-head \ncap screws, 0.060 through 4 in. in diameter where high \nstrength is required. \nNOTE 1 - A complete metric companion to Specification A 574 has \nbeen developed-A 574M; therefore no metric equivalents are presented \nin this specification. \n1.2 The following hazard caveat pertains only to the \ntest method portion, Section 12, of this specification. This \nstandard does not purport to address all of the safety \nconcerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsi\u00ad\nbility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate \nsafety and health practices and determine the applicability \nof regulatory limitations prior to use. \n2.

Terminology \n3.1 Definitions: \n3.1.1 Definitions of discontinuities covered by 10.2 \nfollow: \n3.1.2 crack- clean crystalline break passing through \nthe grain or grain boundary without inclusion of foreign \nelements. \n3.1.3 inclusions - particles of nonmetallic impuri\u00ad\nties, usually oxides, sulfides, silicates, and such, which are \nmechanically held in the steel during solidification. \n3.1.4 nicks or pits - depressions or indentations in \nthe surface of the metal. \n3.1.5 seam or lap - noncrystalline break through the \nmetal which is inherently in the raw material. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 Orders for socket head cap screws under this speci-\nfication shall include the following: \n4.1.1 ASTM designation and year of issue. \n4.1.2 Quantities (number of pieces by size). \n4.1.3 Size and length. \n4.2 Orders for socket head cap screws may include the \nfollowing optional requirements: \n4.2.1 Inspection at point of manufacture. \n4.2.2 Coating, if a protective finish other than black \noxide (thermal or chemical) is required, it must be spec\u00ad\nified. \n4.2.3 Certified test reports (see 11.2). \n4.2.4 Additional testing (see 11.3). \n4.2.5 Special packaging (see 16.1.2). \n4.2.6 Supplementary requirements (see Sl). \n4.2.7 Special requirements. \n1014 ",
