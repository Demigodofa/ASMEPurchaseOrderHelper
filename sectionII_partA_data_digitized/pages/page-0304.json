These grades shall be \nuniformly reheated to the proper austenitizing temperature (a \ngroup thus reheated being known as a quenching charge) and \nquenched under substantially uniform conditions for each \nquenching charge and tempered as shown below. Grades 2H, \n, 2HM, 3, 7, and 7M shall be liquid quenched. Grades 6 and 6F \nshall be quenched in liquid or inert gas. Grade 16 shall be \nheated to a temperature range from 1700 to 1750 \u00b0F (925 to \n955 \u00b0C) and oil quenched. \nMinimum Tempering Temperature, \u00b0F \nGrade [ 0 C] \n2H 850 [455] \n2HM 1150 [620] \n3 1050 [565] \n6 and 6F 1100 [595] \n7 1100 [595] \n7M 1150 [620] \n43 1100 [595] \n16 1200 [650] \nNuts machined from bar heat treated in accordance with this \nspecification need not be reheat-treated.
