When the steel is to be welded, it is presupposed that \na welding procedure suitable for the grade of steel and intended \nuse or service will be utilized. \n1.7 In case of any conflict in requirements, the requirements \nof the applicable product specification prevail over those of this \ngeneral requirements specification. \n1.8 Additional requirements that are specified in the pur\u00ad\nchase order and accepted by the supplier are permitted, \nprovided that such requirements do not negate any of the \nrequirements of this general requirements specification or the \napplicable product specification. \n1.9 For purposes of determining conformance with this \ngeneral requirements specification and the applicable product \nspecification, values are to be rounded to the nearest unit in the \nright-hand place of figures used in expressing the limiting \nvalues in accordance with the rounding method of Practice \nE29. \n1. 10 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n1.11 This general requirements specification and the appli\u00ad\ncable product specification are expressed in both inch-pound \nunits and SI units; unless the order specifies the applicable \"M\" \nspecification designation (SI units), the plates are to be \nfurnished to inch-pound units. \n1.12 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
