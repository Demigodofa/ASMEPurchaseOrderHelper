[1.5 mm] or less end to end. 
S19.2.3 Ten or more indications exceeding 1/16 in. [1.5 mm] 
in major dimensions contained in any 6 in.2 [40 cm 2 ] of 
• surface, with the major dimension in this area not to exceed 
6 in. [150 mm]. The area shall be taken in the most unfavorable 
location relative to the indications being evaluated. 
S20. Ultrasonic Examination 
S20.1 illtrasonic examination of forgings shall be carried 
out in accordance with Practice A388/A388M. 
S20.2 Unless otherwise agreed upon between the manufac­
turer and the purchaser, acceptance levels BR or DA shall be 
specified for the longitudinal wave examination and level S for 
shear wave examination. 
Level BR-Longitudinal Wave 
. S20.2.1 The back reflection method of tuning shall be used 
••• in accordance with Practice A388/A388M. 
S20.2.2 In addition to the reportable conditions of the 
Recording Section of Practice A388/A388M, indications ex­
ceeding the resultant back reflection shall be recorded. 
S20.2.3 The following conditions are subject to rejection, or 
repair if applicable. 
S20.2.3.1 Complete loss of back reflection accompanied by 
an indication of a discontinuity. For this purpose, a back 
reflection less than 5 % of full screen height shall be consid­
ered complete loss of back reflection. 
S20.2.3.2 An indication equal in amplitude to that of the 
back reflection established in an indication-free portion of the 
forging. 
Level DA-Longitudinal Wave 
S20.2.4 Reference blocks of acoustically similar metal shall 
be used for calibration. Blocks shall meet one of the following 
requirements: 
S20.2.4.1 A comparison of the back reflections between 
equivalent thicknesses of the reference block material and the 
actual forging to be tested, without change in instrument 
setting shall not show a variation in excess of 25 %. 
S20.2.4.2 The reference blocks shall be manufactured from 
steel that is similar in chemistry and processing history to the 
production forging being tested. The reference blocks shall be 
fabricated in accordance with the procedures of Practice E428. 
S20.2.4.3 For test sections up to and including 12 in. 
[300 mm] thick, the reference blocks shall contain a ¼ in. 
[6 mm] diameter flat-bottom hole; for over 12 in. [300 mm] up 
to and including 18 in. [300 to 450 mm], the hole diameter 
shall be 3 /s in. [10 mm]; and for over 18 in. [450 mm], it shall 
be ½ in. [13 mm]. 
S20.2.4.4 A distance-amplitude correction curve shall be 
established for the proper grade of steel and specified hole size. 
S20.2.4.5 A forging containing one or more indications 
equal in amplitude to that of the applicable reference hole, 
when properly corrected for distance, is subject to rejection, or 
repair if applicable. 
Level S-Shear Wave 
S20.2.5 Calibration notches, calibration reference, and 
method of scanning shall be in accordance with Practice 
A388/A388M. Unless otherwise agreed upon, a 60° V-notch 
shall be used. 
S20.2.6 A forging containing a discontinuity that results in 
an indication exceeding the amplitude of the reference line is 
subject to rejection. 
S20.2.7 The report of the ultrasonic examination shall be in 
compliance with Practice A388/A388M. 
S20.2.8 Additional nondestructive examination or trepan­
ning may be employed to resolve questions of interpretation of 
ultrasonic indications. The manufacturer shall accept respon­
sibility for injurious conditions that will not be removed in final 
machining. 
S21. Additional Test Coupon Heat Treatment 
S21.1 When subcritical heat treatment, applied to a com­
pleted forging during subsequent fabrication, may affect the 
mechanical properties of the forging, then coupons for the 
mechanical testing required by the product specification shall 
be given a laboratory heat treatment, which simulates the 
anticipated subcritical heat treatment. 
S21.2 The purchaser shall specify the required heat treat­
ment temperature range, minimum time at temperature, and the 
rates of heating and cooling. 
S21.3 The required number of test coupons shall be taken 
from the forging location described in the product specifica­
tion. 
S21.4 The test specimens shall meet the minimum mechani­
cal test requirements of the product specification, as well as 
those of any additional tests agreed upon between producer and 
purchaser, after completion of the test coupon heat treatment. 
S21.5 The forgings supplied in accordance with this supple­
mentary requirement shall be marked in accordance with 
17.1.7. 
S21.6 The material test reports shall include the heat treat­
ment of the as-delivered material and the results of the 
mechanical tests from the test coupons subjected to the 
purchaser specified heat treatments that represent fabrication. 
S22. Ultrasonic Examination from Bore Surface 
S22.1 Bored cylindrical forgings shall be examined from the 
bored surface in accordance with Practice A939/ A939M. The 
acceptance criteria shall be agreed upon between the purchaser 
and the producer. 
S23. Magnetic Particle Examination Using AC Current 
S23.1 The designated surfaces of ferromagnetic steel forg­
ings shall be examined at the stage in machining specified by 
the purchaser in accordance with Practice A966/ A966M. The 
acceptance criteria for the examination shall be specified by the 
purchaser. 
S24. Jractor 
S24.1 The Jfactor• calculated by means of the following 
equation, shall be established for each heat of steel used in 
forging manufacture:
