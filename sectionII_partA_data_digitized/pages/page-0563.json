Tensile and Hardness Requirements \n9 .1 The tensile properties of the material shall conform to \nthe requirements prescribed in Table 3. \n9.2 Table 4 lists elongation requirements. \n9.3 Table 5 gives the computed minimum elongation values \nfor each 1/32-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. Where the \nwall thickness lies between two values above, the minimum \nelongation value is determined by the following formula: \nDirection of Test \nLongitudinal, all grades except P23, P24, \nP36, P91 Type 1 and Type 2, P92, \nP921, P93, P115, P122, P128, and \nP911 \nTransverse, all grades except P23, P24, \nP36, P91 Type 1 and Type 2, P92, \nP921, P93, P115, P122, P128, and \nP911 \nLongitudinal, P23, P24, P91 Type 1 and \nType 2, P92, P921, P115, P122, P128, \nand P911 \nLongitudinal, P36 \nLongitudinal, P93 \nwhere: \nE = elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm, %, and \nt = actual thickness of specimens, in. [mm]. \nEquation 8 \nE = 481 + 15.00 \n[E = 1.87 t + 15.00] \nE = 321 + 10.00 \n[E = 1.25 t + 10.00] \nE = 321 + 10.00 \n[E = 1.25 t + 10.00] \nE = 321 + 5.0 \n[E = 1.25 t+ 5.0] \nE = 321 + 9.0 \n[E = 1.25 t+ 9.0] \n9.4 Table 6 lists hardness requirements. \n9.5 For Grade P91 Type 1 and Type 2, when quenching and \ntempering has been performed, the tensile and hardness prop-\nerties shall be met and verified on material taken from the \nhalf-thickness location. \n10. Permissible Variations in Diameter \n10.1 For pipe ordered to NPS [DN] or outside diameter, \nvariations in outside diameter shall not exceed those specified \nin Table 7. \n10.2 For pipe ordered to inside diameter, the inside diameter \nshall not vary more than :\u00b1: 1 % from the specified inside \ndiameter. \n11. Permissible Variations in Wall Thickness \n11.1 In addition to the implicit limitation of wall thickness \nfor pipe imposed by the limitation on weight in Specification \nA999/ A999M, the wall thickness for pipe at any point shall be \nwithin the tolerances specified in Table 8. The minimum wall \nthickness and outside diameter for inspection for compliance \nwith this requirement for pipe ordered by NPS [DN] and \nschedule number is shown in ASME B36.10M. \n12. Hydrostatic Test \n12.1 The requirements for grades other than P91 Type 1 and \nType 2, P92, P93, P115, P911, P122, and P128 are shown in \n12.1.1 - 12.1.4. \n12.1.1 Each length of pipe with outside diameter greater \nthan 10 in. [250 mm] and wall thickness less than or equal to \n0.75 in. [19 mm], shall be submitted to the hydrostatic test, \nexcept as provided for in 12.1.4. \n12.1.2 Pipe of all other sizes shall be subjected to the \nnondestructive electric test as shown in Section 13, except as \nprovided for in 12.1.3 and 12.1.4. \n12.1.3 When specified by the purchaser, pipe of all other \nsizes shall be furnished without the hydrostatic test and without \nnondestructive examination. \n12.1.4 When specified by the purchaser, pipe shall be \nfurnished with both the hydrostatic test and a nondestructive \nexamination having been performed. \n12.2 The requirements for grades P91 Type 1 and Type 2, \nP92, P93, P115, P911, P122, and P128 are shown in 12.2.1 -\n12.2.3. \n12.2.1 Each length of pipe with outside diameter greater \nthan 10 in. [250 mm] and wall thickness less than or equal to \n0.75 in. [19 mm], shall be submitted to both the hydrostatic test \nand the ultrasonic test as shown in Section 13. \nTABLE 3 Tensile Requirements \nGrade \nP91 P92, P93, \nP1, P2 P12 P23 P24 Type 1 P911, P921 P115 P122 P128 P36 Class All Others and P36 Class 2 \nT e2 1 \nTensile strength, \nmin: \nksi 55 60 74 85 85 90 109 90 90 94 95.5 60 \nMPa 380 415 510 585 585 620 750 620 620 650 660 415 \nYield strength, \nmin: \nksi 30 32 58 60 60 64 84 65 58 71 66.5 30 \nMPa 205 220 400 415 415 440 580 450 400 490 460 205 \n511 ",
