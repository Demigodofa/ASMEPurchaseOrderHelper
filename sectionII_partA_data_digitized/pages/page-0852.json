Scope \n1.1 This specification covers austenitic alloy steel pipe for \nuse in high-temperature, corrosive, or nuclear pressure service. \n1.2 Several grades of austenitic stainless steel are covered as \nindicated in Table 1. \n1.3 Optional supplementary requirements are provided \nwhen additional testing may be required. \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exactly equivalents; therefore, each system must \nbe used independently of each other. Combining values from \nthe two systems may result in nonconformance with the \nspecification. \nNorn I-This specification is not intended to cover centrifugal pipe \nmade from alloys containing more than 0.20 % carbon, such as are \ncovered by Specification A297/A297M. \n2.

Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for material to this specification shall include the \nfollowing, as required, to describe the desired material ad\u00ad\nequately: \n3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), \n3.1.2 Name of material (centrifugally cast pipe), \n3.1.3 Grade (Table 1), \n3.1.4 Size (outside or inside diameter and minimum wall \nthickness in inches or millimetres), \n3.1.5 Length (specific or random, Specification A999/ \nA999M), \n3.1.6 End Finish of Specification A999/A999M, \n3.1.7 Optional Requirements (9.4 and Supplementary Re\u00ad\nquirements Sl through S7), \n3.1.8 Test Report Required (Section 14), and \n3.1.9 Special Requirements or Additions to Specification. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Heat-Treatment-The pipe shall receive a heat\u00ad\ntreatment at the temperature and time specified in Table 2, \nfollowed by a quench in water or rapid cool by other means. \n4.2 Machining-The pipe shall be machined on the inner \nand outer surfaces to a roughness value no greater than \n250-\u00b5in. [6.35-\u00b5m] arithmetical average deviation (AA) from \nthe mean line, as defined in American National Standard \nB46.1. ",
