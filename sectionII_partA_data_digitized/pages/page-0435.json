The reduced section shall be a gradual taper \nfrom the ends toward the center, with the ends 0.003 to 0.005 in. larger in \ndiameter than the center. \nFIG. 3 Standard Round Tension Test Specimen with 2-in. Gage \nLength \nmillings without danger of contamination from the adjacent \nlayer. If spectrometric procedures are used, the sample shall be \nexposed on the center line of the cladding when there is \nsufficient cladding thickness available so that there is no \ncontamination from the adjacent base metal. \n10.2 If product analysis is specified by the purchaser for the \ncladding alloy, it shall be made on a sample taken from the \nfinished product or a broken test specimen. For wet chemical \nanalysis, in order to avoid contamination by the base plate \nmetal, millings of cladding samples shall be taken from the test \ncoupon by removal and discard of all the base metal plus 40 % \nof the cladding thickness from the bonded side, not to exceed \n1/16 in. (1.6 mm). The material shall be cleaned and sufficient \nminings taken to represent the full cross-section of the remain\u00ad\nder. If there is insufficient cladding thickness available to \nspectrographically expose on the center line of the cladding \nwithout contamination, 50 % of the cladding shall be removed \nand the sample exposed on this surface. \n10.3 The results of the product analysis shall conform to the \nrequirements of Section 7 of Specification A480/A480M. \n10.4 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis \nrequired by this specification shall be in accordance with the \nTest Methods, Practices, and Definitions of A751. \n10.5 Results of the product analysis for the backing steel \nwhen required shall conform to the requirements of Section 7 \nof Specification A20/ A20M. \n11. Permissible Variations \n11.1 Permissible variations except for thickness shall be in \naccordance with Specification A20/ A20M. \n11.2 Minimum thickness of the alloy cladding metal and of \nthe backing steel, or of the total composite plate shall be as \nrequired by purchase order documents when ordered to mini\u00ad\nmum thicknesses. \n11.3 Permissible variation in thickness when ordered to \nnominal thicknesses shall be 0.01 in. (0.3 mm) under each for \nbacking steel or total composite, and 0.03 in. (0.8 mm) under \nfor the alloy cladding. \n11.4 Permissible variations for excess thickness of the total \ncomposite shall be the greater of 0.125 in. (3 mm) or 10 % of \nthe total composite thickness ordered and may occur in either \nbacking steel, cladding, or both, provided the minimum for \neach is met. \n11.5 More restrictive or less restrictive permissible varia\u00ad\ntions may be agreed upon by the purchaser and the manufac\u00ad\nturer. \n12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n12.1 The material shall be free of injurious defects, shall \nhave a workmanlike appearance, and shall conform to the \ndesignated finish. \n12.2 Plate alloy surfaces shall be blasted (descaled by \nmeans of sand or stainless grit, shot, or wire), pickled, \nblast-cleaned and pickled, or 100 % conditioned. \n13. Bond Quality \n13.1 The cladding metal shall be integrally and continu\u00ad\nously bonded to the base metal. \n13.2 Inspection: \n13.2.1 Clad plates less than 3/s in. (10 mm) total minimum \ncomposite thickness shall be visually inspected for bond \nintegrity prior to shipment. \n13.2.2 Clad plates 3/s in. (10 mm) and thicker total minimum \ncomposite thickness, and when specified by the purchaser, clad \nplates less than 3/s in. (10 mm) total minimum composite \nthickness, shall be ultrasonically inspected for bond integrity \nprior to shipment in accordance with the Procedures and \nMethods of Specification A578/A578M. \n13.2.3 Areas of non-bond detected visually shall be ex\u00ad\nplored ultrasonically to determine the extent of the condition in \naccordance with 13.2.2. For purposes of defining non-bond, the \ncladding shall be interpreted to be unbonded when there is \ncomplete loss of back reflection accompanied by an echo \nindication from the plane of the interface of the clad and \nbacking steel. Areas within 1 in. (25 mm) of a cut edge on the \nplate that contain indications exceeding 50 % of the back \nreflection at the bond interface shall be considered to be \nunbonded. \n13.2.4 Extent of ultrasonic examination shall be at the \ndiscretion of the manufacturer and sufficient enough to provide \nthe quality level required by the purchaser. Plates may be \nordered with 100 % coverage (Supplementary Requirement \nS12). \n383 \n13.3 Quality Levels: \n13.3.1 Class I-No single unbonded area exceeding 1 in. \n(25 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not \nto exceed 1 % of the total cladded surface area. \n13.3.2 Class 3-No single unbonded area exceeding 3 in. \n(75 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not \nto exceed 3 % of the total cladded surface area.
