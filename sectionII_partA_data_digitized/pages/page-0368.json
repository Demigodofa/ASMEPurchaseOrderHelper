Scope \n1.1 This specification covers round chromimn-vana\u00ad\ndium alloy steel spring wire having properties and quality \nintended for the manufacture of springs used at moderately \nelevated temperatures. This wire shall be either in the \nannealed and cold-drawn or oil-tempered condition as spec\u00ad\nified by the purchaser. \n1.2 The values stated in either SI (metric) units or inch\u00ad\npound units are to be regarded separately as standard. The \nvalues stated in each system are not exact equivalents; \ntherefore, each system must be used independent of the \nother. \n2.

Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for material under this specification should \ninclude the following information for each ordered item: \n3.1.1 Quantity (mass); \n3.1.2 Name of material (chromium-vanadium alloy \nsteel wire); \n3.1.3 Wire diameter (Table 1 and Table 2); \n3.1.4 Packaging (Section 14); \n3.1.5 Cast or heat analysis report (if requested) (5.2); \n3.1.6 Certification and test report (Section 13); and \n3.1.7 ASTM designation and date of issue. \nNOTE 1 - A typical ordering description is as follows: 20,000 kg oil\u00ad\ntempered chromium-vanadium alloy steel wire, size 6.00 mm in 150 kg \ncoils to ASTM A 231M dated ____ , or for inch-pound units, \n40 000 lb oil-tempered chromium-vanadium alloy steel spring wire, size \n0.250 in. in 350 lb coils to ASTM A 231 dated. __ _ \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 The steel may be made by any commercially \naccepted steel-making process. The steel may be either \ningot cast or strand cast. \n4.2 The finished wire shall be free from detrimental \npipe and undue segregation. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to \nchemical composition specified in Table 3. \n5.2 Cast or Heat Analysis - Each cast or heat of steel \nshall be analyzed by the manufacturer to determine the ",
