SA-426/SA-426M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Centrifugally Cast Ferritic Alloy Steel Pipe for High­
Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers centrifugally cast alloy steel 
pipe intended for use in high-temperature, high-pressure ser­
vice. 
1.2 Several grades of ferritic steels are covered. Their 
compositions are given in Table 1. 
1.3 Supplementary Requirements Sl through S12 are 
provided. The supplementary requirements provide for addi­
tional tests of an optional nature and when desired shall be so 
stated in the order (Section 4). 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.4.1 Within the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. 
l .5 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica­
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.
