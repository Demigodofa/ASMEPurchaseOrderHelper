A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Deparnnent of Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers carbon steel castings for \nvalves, flanges, fittings, or other pressure-containing parts for \nhigh-temperature service and of quality suitable for assembly \nwith other castings or wrought steel parts by fusion welding. \n1.2 Three grades, WCA, WCB, and WCC, are covered in \nthis specification. Selection will depend upon design and \nservice conditions, mechanical properties, and the high\u00ad\ntemperature characteristics. \n1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in nonconformance \nwith the standard. \n1 .4 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: 3 \nA488/A488M Practice for Steel Castings, Welding, Qualifi\u00ad\ncations of Procedures and Personnel \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee A0l on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nAO 1.18 on Castings. \nCurrent edition approved Sept. 1, 2021. Published September 2021. Originally \napproved in 1939. Last previous edition approved in 2018 as A216/A216M - 18. \nDOI: 10.!520/A0216_A0216M-21. \n2 For ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code applications, see related Specifi\u00ad\ncation SA-216/SA-216M in Section II of that code. \n3 For referenced ASTM standards, visit the ASTM website, www.astm.org, or \ncontact ASTM Customer Service at service@astm.org.

General Conditions for Delivery \n3 .1 Except for investment castings, castings furnished to \nthis specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci\u00ad\nfication A 703/ A 703M, including any supplementary require\u00ad\nments that are indicated in the purchase order. Failure to \ncomply with the general requirements of Specification A703/ \nA703M constitutes nonconformance with this specification. In \ncase of conflict between the requirements of this specification \nand Specification A703/A703M, this specification shall pre\u00ad\nvail. \n3.2 Steel investment castings furnished to this specification \nshall conform to the requirements of Specification A985/ \nA985M, including any supplementary requirements that are \nindicated in the purchase order. Failure to comply with the \ngeneral requirements of Specification A985/A985M consti\u00ad\ntutes nonconformance with this specification. In case of con\u00ad\nflict between the requirements of this specification and Speci\u00ad\nfication A985/A985M, Specification A985/A985M shall \nprevail. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 The inquiry and order should include or indicate the \nfollowing: \n4.1.1 A description of the casting by pattern number or \ndrawing (dimensional tolerances shall be included on the \ncasting drawing), \n4 Available from Manufacturers Standardization Society of the Valve and Fittings \nIndustry (MSS), 127 Park St., NE, Vienna, VA 22180-4602, http://www.mss\u00ad\nhq.com. \n* A Summary of Changes section appears at the end of this standard \n300 ",
