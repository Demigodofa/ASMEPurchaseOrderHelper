This requirement does not preclude additional testing \nat earlier stages in the processing. \n25.4 Surface Condition: \n25.4.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, paint, \nor other foreign material that could interfere with interpretation \nof test results. The methods used for cleaning and preparing the \nsmfaces for examination shall not be detrimental to the base \nmetal or the surface finish. \n25.4.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can \nproduce signals that interfere with the test. \n25.5 Extent of Examination: \n25.5.1 The relative motion of the tube and the transducer(s), \ncoil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire tube surface is \nscanned, except for end effects as noted in 25.5.2. \n25.5.2 The existence of end effects is recognized, and the \nextent of such effects shall be determined by the manufacturer, \nand, if requested, shall be reported to the purchaser. Other \nnondestrnctive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to \nagreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. \n25.6 Operator Qualifications: \n25.6.l The test unit operator shall be certified in accordance \nwith SNT-TC-lA, or an equivalent documented standard \nagreeable to both purchaser and manufacturer. \n25.7 Test Conditions: \n25.7.1 For examination by the ultrasonic method, the mini\u00ad\nmum nominal transducer frequency shall be 2.0 MHz, and the \nmaximum transducer size shall be 1.5 in. [38 mm]. \n25.7.2 For eddy current testing, the excitation coil fre\u00ad\nquency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration, yet \nprovide good signal-to-noise ratio. \n25.7.2.1 The maximum coil frequency shall be: \nSpecified Wall Thickness, in. [mm] Maximum Frequency, kHz \n<0.050 in. [1.25] 100 \n0.050 to 0.150 (1.25 to 3.80] 50 \n>0.150 [3.80] 10 \n25.8 Reference Standards: \n25.8.1 Reference standards of convenient length shall be \nprepared from a length of tube of the same grade, specified size \n(outside diameter and wall thickness), surface finish, and heat \ntreatment condition as the tubing to be examined. \n25.8.2 For eddy cmrent testing, the reference standard shall \ncontain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the \nfollowing discontinuities: \n25.8.2.1 Drilled Hole-The reference standard shall contain \nthree or more holes, equally spaced circumferentially around \nthe tube and longitudinally separated by a sufficient distance to \nallow distinct identification of the signal from each hole. The \nholes shall be drilled radially and completely through the tube \nwall, with care being taken to avoid distortion of the tube while \ndrilling. The holes shall not be larger than 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] \nin diameter. As an alternative, the producer may choose to drill \none hole and nm the calibration standard through the test coil \nthree times, rotating the tube approximately 120\u00b0 each time. \nMore passes with smaller angular increments may be used, \nprovided testing of the full 360\u00b0 of the coil is obtained. For \nwelded tubing, if the weld is visible, one of the multiple holes \nor the single hole shall be drilled in the weld. \n25.8.2.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool \nor file with a\u00bc in. [6.4 mm] diameter, a notch shall be milled \nor filed tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu\u00ad\ndinal axis of the tube. Said notch shall have a depth not \nexceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or \n0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. \n25.8.2.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. (0.8 mm) or \nless in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the \ntube axis on the outside smface of the tube, to have a depth not \nexceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the tube or \n0.004 in. (0.1 mm), whichever is greater. The length of the \nnotch shall be compatible with the testing method. \n25.8.2.4 When minimum wall tubing is specified, the notch \ndepth shall be based on the calculated average wall thickness \nfrom Table 2 (see Note 3). \n25.8.3 For ultrasonic testing, the reference ID and OD \nnotches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes \nshown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The \ndepth of the notches shall not exceed 12.5 % of the specified \naverage wall thickness of the tube or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], \nwhichever is greater. When minimum tubing is specified, the \nnotch depth shall be based on the calculated average wall \nthickness from Table 2 (see Note 3). The width of the notch \nshall not exceed two times the depth. For welded tubing, the \nnotches shall be placed in the weld, if the weld is visible. When \nthe notch is placed in the weld, the notch depth shall be \nmeasured from the surface of the weld. \nNorn 3-To calculate the average wall thickness when minimum wall \ntubing is specified, the calculated average wall shall be the specified \nminimum wall plus V2 of the Permitted Maximum Variation in Wall \nThickness cited in Table 2. For example, when a cold finished, 1 by 0.083 \nin. [25 by 2 mm] minimum wall seamless tube is specified, the calculated \naverage thickness will be 0.091 in. (0.083 in.+ V2 (20 %)) [2.2 mm (2 mm \n+ \u00bd (20 %))]. \n25.8.4 For flux leakage testing, the longitudinal reference \nnotches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a radial \nplane parallel to the tube axis on the inside and outside surfaces \nof the tube. Notch depth shall not exceed 12.5 % of the \nspecified wall thickness or 0.004 in. [0.l mm], whichever is \ngreater. Notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25.4 mm], and the \nwidth shall not exceed the depth. Outside and inside notches \nshall have sufficient separation to allow distinct identification \nof the signal from each notch. \n25.8.5 When minimum wall tubing is specified, the notch \ndepth shall be based on the calculated average wall thickness \nfrom Table 2 (see Note 3). \n1532 ",
