SA-249 /SA-249M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Welded Austenitic Steel Boiler, Superheater, Heat­
Exchanger, and Condenser Tubes 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers nominal-wall-thickness 
welded tubes and heavily cold worked welded tubes made from 
the austenitic steels listed in Table 1, with various grades 
intended for such use as boiler, superheater, heat exchanger, or 
condenser tubes. 
1.2 Grades TP304H, TP309H, TP309HCb, TP310H, 
TP310HCb, TP316H, TP321H, TP347H, and TP348H are 
modifications of Grades TP304, TP309S, TP309Cb, TP310S, 
TP310Cb, TP316, TP321, TP347, and TP348, and are intended 
for high-temperature service such as for superheaters and 
reheaters. 
1.3 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter to 12 in. 
[304.8 mm] in outside diameter and 0.015 to 0.320 in. [0.4 to 
8.1 mm], inclusive, in wall thickness. Tubing having other 
dimensions may be furnished, provided such tubes comply 
with all other requirements of this specification. 
1.4 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.5 Optional supplementary requirements are provided and, 
when one or more of these are desired, each shall be so stated 
in the order. 
1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.7 The following safety hazards caveat pertains only to the 
test method described in the Supplementary Requirements of 
this specification. This standard does not purport to address all 
of the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. A 
specific warning statement is given in Supplementary Require­
ment S7, Note S7.1. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
