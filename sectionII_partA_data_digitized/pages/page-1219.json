The test specimen shall be tested at \nroom temperature in accordance with Test Methods and Defi\u00ad\nnitions A370. \n8.2 Transverse-Guided-Weld-Bend Tests: \n8.2.1 Requirements-The bend test shall be acceptable if no \ncracks or other defects exceeding Vs in. [3 mm] in any direction \nbe present in the weld metal or between the weld and the pipe \nmetal after bending. Cracks that originate along the edges of \nthe specimens during testing, and that are less than \u00bc in. [6 \nmm] in any direction shall not be considered. \n8.2.2 Number of Tests-One test (two specimens) shall be \nmade to represent each lot of finished pipe. \n8.2.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation-Two bend \ntest specimens shall be taken transverse to the weld at the end \nof the finished pipe. As an alternative, by agreement between \nthe purchaser and the manufacturer, the test specimens may be \ntaken from a test plate of the same material as the pipe, the test \nplate being attached to the end of the cylinder and welded as a \nprolongation of the pipe longitudinal weld seam. \n8.2.4 Test Method-Bend tests shall be made in accordance \nwith Test Methods and Definitions A370, A 2.5.1.7. For wall \nthicknesses over 3/s in. [10 mm] but less than\u00be in. [19 mm] \nside-bend tests may be made instead of the face and root-bend \ntests. For wall thicknesses \u00be in. [19 mm] and over both \nspecimens shall be subjected to the side-bend test. \n8.3 Pressure Test-Classes X2 and X3, pipe shall be tested \nin accordance with Specification A530/A530M, Hydrostatic \nTest Requirements. \n9. Radiographic Examination \n9.1 The full length of each weld of classes Xl and X2 shall \nbe radiographically examined in accordance with requirements \nof the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, \nParagraph UW-51. \n9.2 Radiographic examination may be pe1formed prior to \nheat treatment. \n10. Rework \n10.1 Elimination of Surface Imperfections-Unacceptable \nsurface imperfections shall be removed by grinding or machin\u00ad\ning. The remaining thickness of the section shall be no less than \nthe minimum specified in Section 11. The depression after \ngrinding or machining shall be blended uniformly into the \nsurrounding surface. \n10.2 Repair of Base Metal Defects by Welding: \n10.2.1 The manufacturer may repair, by welding, base metal \nwhere defects have been removed, provided the depth of the \nrepair cavity as prepared for welding does not exceed 1/3 of the \nnominal thickness, and the requirements of 10.2.2, 10.2.3, \n10.2.4, 10.2.5, and 10.2.6 are met. Base metal defects in excess \nof these may be repaired with prior approval of the customer. \n10.2.2 The defect shall be removed by suitable mechanical \nor thermal cutting or gouging methods and the cavity prepared \nfor repair welding. \n10.2.3 The welding procedure and welders or welding \noperators are to be qualified in accordance with Section IX of \nthe ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. \n10.2.4 The full length of the repaired pipe shall be heat \ntreated after repair in accordance with the requirements of the \npipe class specified. \n10.2.5 Each repair weld of a defect where the cavity, \nprepared for welding, has a depth exceeding the lesser of 3/s in. \n[10 mm] or 10 % of the nominal thickness shall be examined \nby radiography in accordance with the methods and the \nacceptance standards of Section 9. \n10.2.6 The repair surface shall be blended uniformly into \nthe surrounding base metal surface and examined and accepted \nin accordance with Supplementary Requirements S6 or S8. \n10.3 Repair of Weld Metal Defects by Welding: \n10.3.1 The manufacturer may repair weld metal defects if he \nmeets the requirements of 10.2.3, 10.2.4, 10.3.2, 10.3.3, and \n10.4. \n10.3.2 The defect shall be removed by suitable mechanical \nor thermal cutting or gouging methods and the repair cavity \nexamined and accepted in accordance with Supplementary \nRequirements S7 or S9. \n10.3.3 The weld repair shall be blended uniformly into the \nsurrounding metal smfaces and examined and accepted in \naccordance with 9.1 and with Supplementary Requirements S7 \nor S9. \n10.4 Retest-Each length of repaired pipe of a class requir\u00ad\ning a pressure test shall be hydrostatically tested following \nrepair. \n11. Dimensions, Mass, and Permissible Variations \n11.1 The wall thickness and weight for welded pipe fur\u00ad\nnished to this specification shall be governed by the require\u00ad\nments of the specification to which the manufacturer ordered \nthe plate. \n11.2 Permissible variations in dimensions at any point in a \nlength of pipe shall not exceed the following: \n11.2.1 Outside Diameter-Based on circumferential \nmeasurement, \u00b1 0.5 % of the specified outside diameter. \n11.2.2 Out-of-Roundness-The difference between major \nand minor outside diameters, 1 %. \n11.2.3 Alignment-Using a 10-ft [3-m] straightedge placed \nso that both ends are in contact with the pipe, 1/s in. [3 mm]. \n11.2.4 Thickness-The minimum wall thickness at any point \nin the pipe shall not be more than 0.01 in. [0.3 mm] under the \nspecified nominal thickness. \n11.3 Circumferential welded joints of the same quality as \nthe longitudinal joints shall be permitted by agreement between \nthe manufacturer and the purchaser. \n11.4 Lengths with unmachined ends shall be within -0, \n+\u00bd in. [-0, + 13 mm] of that specified. Lengths with machined \nends shall be as agreed between the manufacturer and the \npurchaser. \n1133 ",
