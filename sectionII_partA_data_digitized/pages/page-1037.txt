ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-543/SA-543M 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice - The steel shall b~ killed 
and shall conform to the fine austenitic grain size require­
ment of Specification A 20/ A 20M. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 All plates shall be heat treated by heating to a 
suitable austenitizing temperature, holding for a sufficient 
time period to attain uniform temperature through the thick­
ness and quenching in a suitable liquid medium by spraying 
or immersion. The plates shall then be tempered to produce 
the required properties by heating to a suitable temperature 
not lower than 1100°P [595°C] with a holding time of not 
less than ½ h/in. [1.2 min/mm] of thickness but not less 
than½ h. 
5.2 Plates over 4 in. [100 mm] in thickness shall receive 
a prior treatment of normalizing at, or water quenching 
from a temperature within the range from 1650 to 1850°P 
[900 to 1010°C] before the heat treatment specified in 5.1. 
5.3 When the fabricator elects to perform the heat 
treatment in 5.1 and 5.2, the manufacturer shall normalize 
the plates at an appropriate temperature prior to shipment 
unless otherwise agreed to.

6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical require­
ments shown in Table 1 unless otherwise modified in accor­
dance with Supplementary Requirement S 17, Vacuum 
Carbon-Deoxidized Steel, in Specification A 20/ A 20M. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7.1 Tension Test Requirements: 
7.1.1 The material as represented by the tension-test 
specimens shall conform to the requirements shown in 
Table 2. 
7.1.2 Fornominal plate thicknesses of¾ in. [20 mm] 
and under, the 1½ in. [40 mm] wide rectangular specimen 
may be used for the tension test and the elongation may 
be determined in a 2 in. [50 mm] gage length that includes 
the fracture and shows the greatest elongation.
