3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out­
lines additional ordering information, manufacturing 
requirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, 
marking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi­
tional supplementary requirements. 
3.2 In addition to the ordering requirementsof Specification 
A788/A788M, the purchaser shall include the maximum de­
sign temperature (MDT), if lower than 600 °F [315 °C], and 
the maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP), if lower 
than 250 psi [1.7 MPa] as allowed in 1.2 of the Scope. 
3 .3 When ordering pressure rolls the purchaser shall stipu­
late the required condition, either surface hardened (Condition 
H) or as heat treated (Condition S). In the event that the 
condition is not specified the default condition is H. 
3.4 If a corrugating roll is required to be surface hardened 
by the forging supplier, prior to forming the flutes by the 
purchaser, the requirements of Supplementary Requirement S 1 
shall apply. 
3.5 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, then the 
requirements of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Forging Process: 
4.1.1 Roll body forgings may be made as solid forgings and 
subsequently bored. 
4.1.2 Trunnions or gudgeons which are to be subsequently 
assembled to form the roll shall be made as a solid forging or 
where practical upset from segments cut from billets or bars. 
4.2 Heat Treatment: 
4.2.1 Heat Treatment for Mechanical Properties (Require­
ments do not apply to surface treatment): 
4.2.1.1 Machining-The forged roll body shall have all 
surfaces rough machined, including boring, prior to heat 
treatment for mechanical properties and be tested in accor­
dance with 6.1.2.1. The manufacturer may opt to bore after 
heat treatment for mechanical properties instead provided the 
forging is tested in accordance with 6.1.2.2. 
4.2.1.2 Roll bodies shall be normalized, liquid quenched, 
and tempered to produce the required mechanical properties, 
except that for Class 2 forgings, and when Grade 2 strength 
requirements are specified, a normalize and temper heat 
treatment may be applied. 
4.2.1.3 The trunnions shall be normalized and tempered or 
annealed to produce the required mechanical properties. 
4.2.2 Su,face Hardening of Pressure Roll Forgings-For 
Condition H the working face of pressure rolls shall be surface 
hardened either before or after fitting the trunnions, at the 
manufacturer's option. Surface hardening by weld overlays is 
not permitted for Condition H or (subsequently) for Condition 
s. 
4.3 Assembly and Weld-Except for integrally forged or 
bolted-on trunnions, the assembly shall be made by shrink 
fitting trunnions into the prepared body ends. If used, welding 
of the trunnion to the roll body is restricted to a 3/s in. [9.5 mm] 
max. seal weld, made with low hydrogen materials. A mini­
mum preheat of 400 °F [205 °C] and a minimum post weld 
heat treatment of 850 °F [455 °C] for 8 h shall be used. The 
maximum post weld heat treatment shall be not higher than t -
50 °F [t - 28 °C] where tis the final tempering temperature. All 
welds shall be machined or ground for the final magnetic 
particle or liquid penetrant examination.
