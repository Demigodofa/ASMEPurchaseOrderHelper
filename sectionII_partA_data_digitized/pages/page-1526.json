Structural Integrity Requirements \n8.1 Microporosity: \n8.1.1 The parts shall be free of microporosity as demon\u00ad\nstrated by measurement of density as provided in 8.1.2 or by \nmicrostructural examination as provided in 8.1.3. \n8.1.2 Density Measurement: \n8.1.2.1 The density measurement shall be used for accep\u00ad\ntance of material but not for rejection of material. The \nmeasured density for each production lot shall exceed 99 % of \nthe density typical of that grade when wrought and in the same \nheat treated condition as the sample. A production lot that fails \nto meet this acceptance criterion is permitted, at the option of \nthe producer, to be tested for microporosity in accordance with \nthe microstructural examination as provided in 8.1.3. \n8.1.2.2 Density shall be determined for one sample from \neach production lot by measuring the difference in weight of \nthe sample when weighed in air and when weighed in water \nand multiplying this difference by the density of water (Archi\u00ad\nmede's principle). The equipment used shall be capable of \n1472 \nfurnace cool \nair cool B 1250 [675] \nair cool B 1350 [730] \nfurnace cool B B \nfurnace cool B B \nair cool B 1250 [675] \ndetermining density within \u00b10.004 lb/in. 3 [0.10 g/cm 3 ]. \nAlternatively, at the option of the producer, it is permitted to \nuse Test Method B311 to determine the density. \n8.1.2.3 At the option of the producer, the density shall be \ncompared to the room temperature density typical of wrought \nalloy steels or to the density of a wrought reference sample of \nthe same grade heat treated in accordance with the require\u00ad\nments of Table 2 (see Note 2). The typical density for alloy \nsteel in the annealed condition at\u00b7 room temperature is 0.28 \nlb/in.3 [7.8 g/cm 3 ]. \nNoTE 2-The actual density of alloy steel varies slightly with compo\u00ad\nsition and heat treatment. For this reason, small differences in the \nmeasured density from the typical density for a given grade of steel may \nbe the result of differences in alloy content, heat treatment, or micropo\u00ad\nrosity. When density values are measured that are less than the density \ntypical of a given grade of steel, it is appropriate to examine the sample \nfor microporosity by the more specific metallographic examination \nprocedures. \n8.1.3 Microstructural Examination: \n8.1.3.1 The microstructure shall be examined at 20-50x, \n100-200x, and 1000-2000x and shall be reasonably uniform \nand shall be free of voids, laps, cracks, and porosity. \n8.1.3.2 One sample from each production lot shall be \nexamined. The sample shall be taken from the component, \nstem, protrusion, or test part made from a single powder blend \nconsolidated in the same hot isostatic press using the same \npressure, temperature, and time parameters and heat-treated in ",
