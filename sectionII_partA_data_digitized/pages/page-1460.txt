SA-961/SA-961M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Common Requirements for Steel Flanges, Forged Fittings, 
Valves, and Parts for Piping Applications 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers a group of common require­
ments that shall apply to steel flanges, forged fittings, valves, 
and parts for piping applications under any of the following 
individual product specifications: 
Title of Specification 
Forgings, Carbon Steel, for Piping Components 
Forgings, Carbon Steel, for General-Purpose Piping 
Forged or Rolled Alloy-Steel Pipe Flanges, Forged 
Fittings, and Valves and Parts for High Temperature 
Service 
Forgings, Carbon and Low Alloy Steel, Requiring Notch 
Toughness Testing for Piping Components 
Forged or Rolled 8 and 9 % Nickel Alloy 
Steel Flanges, Fittings, Valves, and Parts 
for Low-Temperature Service 
Forgings, Carbon and Alloy Steel, for Pipe Flanges, 
Fittings, Valves, and Parts for High-Pressure 
Transmission Service 
Flanges, Forged, Carbon and Alloy Steel for Low 
Temperature Service 
Forgings, Carbon Steel, for Piping Components with 
Inherent Notch Toughness 
Forgings, Titanium-Stabilized Carbon Steel, for 
Glass-Lined Piping and Pressure Vessel Service 
ASTM Designation 
A105/A105M 
A181/A181M 
A182/A182M 
A350/A350M 
A522/A522M 
A694/A694M 
A707/A707M 
A727/A727M 
A836/A836M 
1.2 In case of conflict between a requirement of the indi­
vidual product specification and a requirement of this general 
requirement specification, the requirements of the individual 
product specification shall prevail over those of this specifica­
tion. 
1.3 By mutual agreement between the purchaser and the 
supplier, additional requirements may be specified (see Section 
4.1.2). The acceptance of any such additional requirements 
shall be dependent on negotiations with the supplier and must 
be included in the order as agreed upon between the purchaser 
and supplier. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text and 
the tables, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. The inch-pound units shall apply, unless the 
"M" designation (SI) of the product specification is specified in 
the order. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
