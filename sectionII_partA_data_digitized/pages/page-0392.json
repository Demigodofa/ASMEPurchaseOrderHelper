Scope \n1.1 This specification covers chromium, chromium-nickel, \nand chromium-manganese-nickel stainless steel plate, sheet, \nand strip for pressure vessels and for general applications \nincluding architectural, building, construction, and aesthetic \napplications. \n1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n1.3 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound and \nSI units. However, unless the order specifies the applicable \n\"M\" specification designation (SI units), the material shall be \nfurnished in inch-pound units. \nI .4 This standard does not purport to address all of the \nsafety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the \nresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro\u00ad\npriate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter\u00ad\nmine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n340 \n2.
