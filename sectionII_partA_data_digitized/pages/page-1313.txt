4.4.2.3 For plates over 1 ¼ in. to 2 in. [50 mm] inclusive in 
thickness, use the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] Type 2 specimen. 
4.4.2.4 For plates greater than 2 in. [50 nun] in thickness, 
use the Type 3 specimen. 
4.4.3 Alternative Test Specimens-The alternative test 
specimens in Fig. 2 and Table 2 may be used in place of the 
standard specimens in Fig. 1 and Table 1. 
4.4.3.1 For plates over 2 in. [50 mm] in thickness, Type A or 
Type B specimens may be used. The Type A specimen provides 
a reduced section length greater than the plate thickness. The 
Type B specimen provides a reduced section length of 2¼ in. 
[57 mm] with its center at the mid-thickness of the plate. Over 
a minimum plate thickness determined by the specimen end 
configuration, no welded prolongations may be needed for the 
Type B specimen. For plates over 4¼ in. [108 mm] in 
thickness, the Type C specimen may be used. For plates over 6 
in. [150 mm] in thickness, a series of two or more Type A or 
Type C specimens with reduced sections of 4 in. [100 mm] or 
less may be used to cover the full thickness of the plate. The 
number of tests required will depend upon the thickness of the 
plate being tested and the reduced section length selected.

4.4.3.2 For plates over 1 in. [25 mm] in thickness, a series 
of button-head specimens shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2 may be 
used. The test specimen type to be used, Type D, Type E, or 
Type F, is determined by the nominal plate thickness as 
described in Table 2. A series of two or more Type F specimens 
may be used to cover the full thickness of the plate. The length 
of the reduced section (A), as shown in Fig. 2 and specified in 
Table 2, is the length of the reduced section excluding the 
machined radius (R). Within the plate thickness dimension 
specified for each test specimen type, either the button-head 
thickness, the reduced section length, or the machined radius 
may be varied. In all cases, the minimum length of the reduced 
section must be as specified in Table 2 to maintain a minimum 
length to diameter ratio (see Appendix X2.2). 
5. Acceptance Standards 
5.1 Each tension test shall have a minimum reduction of 
area no less than 20 %. If the reduction of area of both tests is 
less than 20 %, no retest shall be permitted. If the reduction of 
area of one of the two tests from a plate is less than 20 %, one 
retest of two additional specimens taken from a location 
adjacent to the specimen that failed may be made, and both of 
these additional specimens shall have a reduction of area of 
20 % or more.
