SA-47 /SA-47M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR FERRITIC MALLEABLE IRON 
CASTINGS 
SA-47 /SA-47M 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A47/A 47M-99(2018)'1, except for the deletion of welded repair references in 11.2 and 11.3, and mandatory 
certification in 14.1.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers ferritic malleable castings 
for general engineering usage at temperatures from normal 
ambient to approximately 400°C (750°F). 
1.2 No precise quantitative relationship can be stated 
between the properties of the iron in various locations of 
the same casting and those of a test specimen cast from 
the same iron (see Appendix Xl). 
1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI 
units are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated 
in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconfonnance 
with the specification.

3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions - Definitions for many terms common 
to iron are found in Terminology A 644. 
4. Classification 
4.1 Castings ordered and produced under this specifi­
cation are classified under the following grades based on 
tests on separately cast test bars. Separately cast test bars 
shall be poured from the same lot of iron as the castings 
they represent and shall be heat treated with those castings 
except as provided in 7.2.3. 
4.1.1 Grade 32510 [Grade 22010]: 
4.1.1.1 The first three digits of the grade designa­
tion indicate the minimum yield strength (X 100 psi [MPa]) 
and the last two digits indicate the minimum elongation 
(% in 2 in. [50 mm]). 
5. Ordering Information 
5.1 The purchase order for castings ordered under this 
specification shall state the specification designation, the 
year in which the specification was issued, and the grade 
of malleable iron to be supplied. Any option or special 
additions to the basic requirements of this specification 
shall be clearly and fully stipulated. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The chemical composition of the iron shall be such 
as to produce the structural and mechanical properties 
required by this specification. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Factors influencing the properties of castings and 
their relationship to those of test specimens and separate 
test castings are discussed in Appendix Xl.
