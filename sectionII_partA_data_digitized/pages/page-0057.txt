1.9 In case of any conflict in requirements, the requirements 
of the applicable product specification prevail over those of this 
general requirements specification. 
1.10 Additional requirements that are specified in the pur­
chase order and accepted by the supplier are permitted, 
provided that such requirements do not negate any of the 
requirements of this general requirements specification or the 
applicable product specification. 
1.11 For purposes of determining conformance with this 
general requirements specification and the applicable product 
specification, values are to be rounded to the nearest unit in the 
right-hand place of figures used in expressing the limiting 
values in accordance with the rounding method of Practice 
E29. 
1.12 The text of this general requirements specification 
contains notes or footnotes, or both, that provide explanatory 
material. Such notes and footnotes, excluding those in tables 
and figures, do not contain any mandatory requirements. 
1.13 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with this 
specification. 
1.14 This general requirements specification and the appli­
cable product specification are expressed in both inch-pound 
units and SI units; however, unless the order specifies the 
applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the struc­
tural product is furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.15 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.16 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 Plates (other than floor plates)-Flat, hot-rolled steel, 
ordered to thickness or weight [mass] and typically width and 
length, commonly classified as follows: 
3.1.1.1 When Ordered to Thickness: 
(1) Over 8 in. [200 mm] in width and 0.230 in. [6 mm] or 
over in thickness. 
(2) Over 48 in. [1200 mm] in width and 0.180 in. [4.5 mm] 
or over in thickness. 
3.1.1.2 When Ordered to Weight [Mass]: 
(1) Over 8 in. [200 mm] in width and 9.392 lb/ft 2 [47.10 
kg/m 2 ] or heavier. 
(2) Over 48 in. [1200 mm] in width and 7.350 lb/ft 2 [35.32 
kg/2n 2 ] or heavier. 
3.1.1.3 Discussion-Steel products are available in various 
thickness, width, and length combinations depending upon 
equipment and processing capabilities of various manufactur­
ers and processors. Historic limitations of a product based upon
