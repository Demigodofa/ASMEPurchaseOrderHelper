Base metal defects in excess of these may be repaired with \nproper approval of the customer. \n10.2.2 The defect shall be removed by suitable mechanical \nor thermal cutting or gouging methods and the cavity prepared \nfor repair welding. \n10.2.3 The welding procedure and welders or welding \noperators are to be qualified in accordance with Section IX of \nthe ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. \n10.2.4 The full length of the repaired pipe shall be heat \ntreated after repair in accordance with the requirements of the \npipe class specified. \n10.2.5 Each repair weld of a defect where the cavity, \nprepared for welding, has a depth exceeding the lesser of 3 /s in. \n[10 mm] or 10 % of the nominal thickness shall be examined \nby radiography in accordance with the methods and the \nacceptance standards of Section 9. \n10.2.6 The repair surface shall be blended uniformly into \nthe surrounding base metal surface and examined and accepted \nin accordance with Section S6 or SS. \n10.3 Repair of Weld Metal Defects by Welding: \nNormalizing Tem\u00ad\nperature, max, \nOF (OC) \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1750 [950] \n1750 [950] \n1750 [950] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1700 [925] \n1800 [980] \n1800 [980] \n1700 [925] \nQuenching Tem\u00ad\nperature, max, \nOF (OC) \n1650 [900] \n1650 [900] \n1650 [900] \n1650 [900] \n1650 [900] \n1800 [980] \n1800 [980] \n1800 [980] \nTempering \nTemperature, min, \nOF (OC) \n1100 [590] \n1100 [590] \n1100 [590] \n1100 [590] \n1100 [590] \n1100 [590] \n1100 [590] \n1100 [590] \n1100 [590] \n1100 [590] \n10.3.1 The manufacturer may repair weld metal defects if he \nmeets the requirements of 10.2.3, 10.2.4, 10.3.2, 10.3.3, and \n10.4. \n10.3.2 The defects shall be removed by suitable mechanical \nor thermal cutting or gouging methods and the repair cavity \nexamined and accepted in accordance with Sections S7 or S9. \n10.3.3 The weld repair shall be blended uniformly into the \nsurrounding metal surfaces and examined and accepted in \naccordance with 9.1 and Sections S7 or S9. \n10.4 Retest-Each length of repaired pipe of a class requir\u00ad\ning a pressure test shall be hydrostatically tested following \nrepair. \n11. Dimensions, Mass and Permissible Variations \n11.1 The wall thickness and weight for welded pipe fur\u00ad\nnished to this specification shall be governed by the require\u00ad\nments of the specification to which the manufacturer ordered \nthe plate. \n11.2 Permissible variations in dimensions at any point in a \nlength of pipe shall not exceed the following: \n11.2.1 Outside Diameter-Based on circumferential mea\u00ad\nsurement :\u00b1: 0.5 % of the specified outside diameter. \n11.2.2 Out-of-Roundness-Difference between major and \nminor outside diameters, 1 %. \n11.2.3 Alignment-Using a 10-ft [3-m] straightedge placed \nso that both ends are in contact with the pipe, Vs in.
