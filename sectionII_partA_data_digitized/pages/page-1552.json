A number in parentheses indicates the year of last \nreapproval. A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1. 1 This specification covers cold-rolled, carbon, structural, \nhigh-strength low-alloy, high-strength low-alloy with im\u00ad\nproved formability, required hardness, full hard, solution \nhardened, and bake hardenable steel sheet, in. coils and cut \nlengths. \n1.2 Cold rolled steel sheet is available in the designations as \nlisted in 4.1. \n1.3 This specification does not apply to steel strip as \ndescribed in Specification Al09/A109M. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: 2 \nAl09/A109M Specification for Steel, Strip, Carbon (0.25 \nMaximum Percent), Cold-Rolled \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.19 on Steel Sheet and Strip. \nCnrrent edition approved May 1, 2024.

Terminology \n3.1 Definitions: \n3 .1.1 For definitions of other terms used in this \nspecification, refer to Terminology A941. \n3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.2.1 aging, n-loss of ductility with an increase in \nhardness, yield strength, and tensile strength that occurs when \nsteel that has been slightly cold worked (such as by temper \nrolling) is stored for some time. \n3.2.1.1 Discussion-Aging increases the tendency of a steel \nto exhibit stretcher strains and fluting. \n3.2.2 Bake Hardenable Steel (BHS), n-steel in which \nsignificant aging is realized when moderate heat treatment, \nsuch as that used for paint baking, follows straining or cold \nworking. \n3.2.3 Full Hard Steel (FHS), n-steel that is cold reduced \nand exhibits a microstructure consisting of non-recrystallized \ngrains. \n3.2.3.1 Discussion-Chemical composition shall be deter\u00ad\nmined by the producer unless there is prior agreement between \nproducer and user, or seller and buyer. \n*A Summary of Changes section appears at the end of this standard \n1498 ",
