A rapid \ncool by other means may be employed in lieu of water quench. \n5A Heat to 2050 \u00b0F [1120 \u00b0CJ minimum, hold for sufficient time to heat \ncasting to temperature, furnace cool to a temperature no lower than \n1910 \u00b0F [1045 \u00b0CJ, then quench in water or rapid cool by other \nmeans. \n6A Heat to 2010 \u00b0F [1100 \u00b0CJ minimum, hold for sufficient time to heat \ncasting uniformly to temperature, quench in water or rapid cool by \nother means, or the casting may be furnace cooled to a temperature \nno lower than 1925 \u00b0F [1050 \u00b0C], hold for 15 min minimum, and then \nquench in water or rapid cool by other means. \n7A Heat to 2065 \u00b0F [1130 \u00b0CJ minimum, hold for sufficient time to heat \ncasting to temperature, furnace cool to a temperature no lower than \n1940 \u00b0F [1060 \u00b0C], then quench in water or rapid cool by other \nmeans. \n5 .1.6 Additional requirements. \n6. Process \n6.1 The steel shall be made by the electric furnace process \nwith or without separate refining. \n7. Heat Treatment \n7 .1 All castings shall be heat treated in accordance with \nTable 1. \n8. Chemical Composition \n8.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to \nchemical composition prescribed in Table 2. \n9. Tensile Properties \n9.1 One tension test shall be made from each heat and shall \nconform to the requirements as to tensile properties prescribed \nin Table 3. \n10. Quality \n10.1 When additional inspection is desired, Supplementary \nRequirements S5, S6, and SlO may be ordered. \n11. Repair by Welding \n11.1 Repairs shall be made using procedures and welders \nqualified under Practice A488/A488M. \n11.2 The composition of the deposited weld metal may be \nsimilar to that of the casting or may be suitably alloyed to \nachieve the desired cmrnsion resistance and mechanical prop\u00ad\nerties. \n11.3 Weld repairs shall be subject to the same quality \nstandards as used to inspect the castings. \n12. Post-Weld Heat Treatment After Major Weld Repair \n12.1 Weld repairs shall be considered major in the case of a \ncasting that has leaked on hydrostatic testing or when the depth \nof the cavity after preparation for repair exceeds 20 % of the \nactual wall thickness, or 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is smaller, \nor when the extent of the cavity exceeds approximately 10 in.2 \n[65 cm 2 ]. All other weld repairs shall be considered minor. \n12.2 Castings shall be heat treated after major weld repairs. \nHeat treatment after minor weld repairs is not required unless \nSupplementary Requirement S 11 is included in the purchase \norder. \n12.3 Post-weld heat treatment shall be in accordance with \nTable 1. \n13. Keywords \n13.1 austenitic-fen-itic; duplex stainless steel; pressure\u00ad\ncontaining; steel castings \n1481 ",
