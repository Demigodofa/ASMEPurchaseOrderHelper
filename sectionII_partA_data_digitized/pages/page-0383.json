Internal and external surfaces \nshall be examined when size permits accessibility. No cracks \nshall be permitted. Other imperfections shall be treated in \naccordance with Section 15 on Surface Finish, Appearance, \nand Corrosion Protection. After the removal of any crack, the \ntee(s) shall be re-examined by the original method. Acceptable \ntees shall be marked with the symbol PT or MT, as applicable, \nto indicate compliance. \nNorn 1-The examination described in 7.6 exists because the great \nbulk of cold-forming strain-induced imperfections are detected in the area \ndescribed. Subsection 7.6 does not waive other areas of a tee from meeting \nthe requirements of Section 15 on Surface Finish, Appearance, and \nCorrosion Protection. \n7.7 Stubends may be produced with the entire lap added by \nthe welding of a ring, made from plate or bar of the same alloy \ngrade and composition, to the outside of a straight section of \npipe, provided the weld is double welded, is a full penetration \njoint, satisfies the requirements of 7 .3 for qualifications and \n8.3.4 for post weld heat treatment. \n8. Heat Treatment \n8.1 Heat Treatment Procedures-Fittings, after forming at \nan elevated temperature, shall be cooled to a temperature \nbelow the critical range under suitable conditions to prevent \ninjurious defects caused by too rapid cooling, but in no case \nmore rapidly than the cooling rate in still air. Heat treatment \ntemperatures specified are metal (part) temperatures. Heat\u00ad\ntreated fittings shall be treated according to Section 7 in \nSpecification A960/A960M. \n8.2 WPB, WPC, and WPR Fittings: \n8.2.1 Hot-formed WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings upon \nwhich the final forming operation is completed at a temperature \nabove 1150 \u00b0F [620 \u00b0C] and below 1800 \u00b0F [980 \u00b0C] need not \nbe heat treated provided they are cooled in still air. \n8.2.2 Hot-formed or forged WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings \nfinished at temperature in excess of 1800 \u00b0F [980 \u00b0C] shall \nsubsequently be annealed, normalized, or normalized and \ntempered. Hot-forged fittings NPS 4 or smaller need not be \nheat treated. \n8.2.3 WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings over NPS 12, produced \nby locally heating a portion of the fitting stock to any \ntemperature for forming, shall be subsequently annealed, \nnormalized, or normalized and tempered. Fittings such as \nelbows, tees, header tees, reducers and lap joint stub ends with \na carbon content less than 0.26 %, NPS 12 and under, shall not \nrequire heat treatment after forming a locally heated portion of \nthe fitting. \n8.2.4 Cold-formed WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings, upon \nwhich the final forming operation is completed at a temperature \nbelow 1150 \u00b0F [620 \u00b0C], shall be normalized, or shall be stress \nrelieved at 1100 to 1275 \u00b0F [595 to 690 \u00b0C]. \n8.2.5 WPB, WPC, and WPR fittings produced by fusion \nwelding and having a nominal wall thickness at the welded \njoint of\u00be in. [19 mm] or greater shall be post-weld heat treated \nat 1100 to 1250 \u00b0F [595 to 675 \u00b0C], or in accordance with 8.2.6. \n8.2.6 At the option of the manufacturer, WPB and WPC \nfittings produced by any of the methods in Section 7 may be \nannealed, normalized, or normalized and tempered. \n8.3 Fittings Other than WPB, WPC, and WPR: \n8.3.1 Fittings of Grades WPl, WPll Class 1, WPll Class 2, \nWPll Class 3, WP12 Class 1, WP12 Class 2, WP22 Class 1, \nWP22 Class 3, WPS, and WP9 shall be furnished in the \nannealed, isothermal-annealed, or normalized and tempered \ncondition. If normalized and tempered, the tempering tempera\u00ad\nture for WPll Class 1, WPll Class 2, WPll Class 3, WP12 \nClass 1, and WP12 Class 2 shall not be less than 1150 \u00b0F [620 \n\u00b0C]; for Grades WPS, WP9, WP22 Class 1, and WP22 Class 3 \nthe tempering temperature shall not be less than 1250 \u00b0F [675 \noc]. \n331 \n8.3.2 Fittings of Grades WPl, WP12 Class 1, or WP12 \nClass 2 either hot formed or cold formed may be given a final \nheat treatment at 1200 \u00b0F [650 \u00b0C] instead of the heat treatment \nspecified in 8.3.1. \n8.3.3 Fittings of WP24 either hot formed or cold formed \nshall be furnished in the normalized and tempered condition. \nThe normalizing temperature range shall be 1800 to 1975 \u00b0F \n[980 to 1080 \u00b0C]. The tempering temperature range shall be \n1350 to 1470 \u00b0F [730 to 800 \u00b0C]. \n8.3.4 Fittings in all thiclmesses produced by fusion welding \nafter the heat treatment specified in 8.3.1 shall be post-weld \nheat treated at a temperature not less than prescribed above for \ntempering except that Grade WPl Type 1 and Type 2 are \nrequired to be post-weld heat treated only when the nominal \nwall thickness at the welded joint is \u00bd in. [13 mm] or greater, \nand except that preheat and post weld heat treatment are not \nrequired for WP24 fittings whose section thickness does not \nexceed 0.500 in. [12.7 mm]. \n8.3.5 Except when Supplementary Requirement Sl is speci\u00ad\nfied by the purchaser, Grade WP91 Type 1 and Type 2 shall be \nnormalized at 1900 \u00b0F [1040 \u00b0C] minimum, and 1975 \u00b0F [1080 \n\u00b0C] maximum, and tempered in the temperature range of 1350 \n\u00b0F [730 \u00b0C] to 1470 \u00b0F [800 \u00b0C] as a final heat treatment. \n8.3.6 Grade WP911 shall be normalized in the temperature \nrange of 1900 to 1975 \u00b0F [1040 to 1080 \u00b0C], and tempered in \nthe temperature range of 1365 to 1435 \u00b0F [740 to 780 \u00b0C] as a \nfinal heat treatment. \n8.3.7 Grade WP92 shall be normalized at 1900 \u00b0F [1040 \u00b0C] \nminimum, and 1975 \u00b0F [1080 \u00b0C] maximum, and tempered in ",
