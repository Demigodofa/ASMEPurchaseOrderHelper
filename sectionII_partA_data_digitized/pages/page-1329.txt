Xl. ALLOY DESIGNATIONS FOR CAST 
STAINLESS STEELS 
Xl.1 Cast stainless steels are usually specified on the 
basis of composition using the alloy designation system 
established by the Alloy Casting Institute (ACI). The ACI 
designations, for example, CF8M, have been adopted by 
ASTM and are preferred for cast alloys over the designa­
tions used by the American Iron and Steel Institute for 
similar wrought steels. 
Xl.2 This nomenclature system has served successfully 
to accommodate changes in old alloys and to designate 
new ones.

Xl.2.1 Service Classification Letter - The first letter 
of the cast stainless steel designation system identifies the 
intended service application of the alloy. The letter Cindi­
cates corrosion-resistant service, and the letter H indicates 
the heat-resistant service at and above 1200°F [649°C]. 
Xl.2.2 Ternary Diagram Location Letter- The second 
letter indicates the approximate location of the nickel and 
chromium contents of the alloy grade on the FeCrNi ternary 
diagram shown in Fig. Xl.1. 
Xl.2.3 Carbon Content Number- For C service classi­
fications, this single or dual digit numeral represents the 
maximum carbon content in units of 0.01 %. For H service 
classifications, this number represents the midpoint of the 
range of carbon content in terms of 0.01 % with a 
±0.05% limit. 
Xl.2.4 Special Elements Letter-Additional letters fol­
lowing the numeral represent special chemical elements in 
the alloy grade, such as M for molybdenum, C for colum­
bium, Cu for copper, W for tungsten. There are two excep­
tions; the letter A indicates Controlled Ferrite, and the 
letter F indicates Free Machining. 
Xl.3 In Fig. Xl.1, unlettered Ni-Cr ranges are associ­
ated with the nearest lettered location. They may be the 
result of differences between corrosion and heat-resistant 
types, or because of the influence of additional elements, 
for example, the precipitation hardening grade CB- 7Cu-1 
and CB-7Cu-2.

CASTING ALLOYS IN SPECIFICATIONS 
A 494/A 494M, A 743/A 743M, A 744/A 744M, 
A 747/A 747M, AND A 890/A 890M 
X2.1 Table X2.1 is provided for the user of the above 
listed specifications as an aid in selecting cast alloys that 
are similar in chemical composition to wrought alloys. It 
is not intended to imply that the cast alloy would have the 
same mechanical, physical or corrosion properties as the 
indicated wrought alloy. 
X3. ADDITION OF NEW GRADES TO 
PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS COVERED BY 
A 781/A 781M 
X3.1 Information required for the inclusion of new 
material grades in product specifications covered by 
A 781/A 781M: 
I. At least one user should support the request. 
2. A set of data from ten production heats, this data 
should include: 
X3.1.1 Chemical composition. 
X3.1.2 Mechanical properties as applicable to the 
product specification being cited. These may include but 
are not limited to the following: 
X3.1.2.1 Ultimate tensile strength, 
X3.1.2.2 Yield strength, 
X3.1.2.3 Reduction in area, 
X3.1.2.4 Elongation, and 
X3.1.2.5 Impact properties (Charpy V). 
X3.2 The test coupon size from which the test pieces 
are removed should be stated for each test. 
X3.2.1 Heat treatment requirements. 
X3.2.2 Weld procedure ( welding should be carried 
out using commercially available consumables).
