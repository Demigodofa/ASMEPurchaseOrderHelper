A The intentional addition of Bi, Se, Te, and Pb is not permitted except for Grade B8F, in which selenium is specified and required. 
8 Typical steel compositions used for this grade include 4140, 4142, 4145, 4140H, 4142H, and 4145H. 
° For the L7M grade, a minimum carbon content of 0.28 % is permitted provided that the required tensile properties are met in the section sizes involved; the use of AISI 
4130 or 4130H is allowed. 
° Class 1 are made from solution-treated material. Class 1 A products (BSA, B8CA, B8MA, B8PA, B8FA, and B8TA) are solution-treated in the finished condition. Class 
2 products are solution-treated and strain-hardened. 
ENiobium and columbium are interchangeable names for the same element and both names are acceptable for use in A01.22 specifications. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7.1 Each alloy shall conform to the chemical composition 
requirements prescribed in Table 3. 
8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
8.1 Bolts, screws, studs, and stud bolts shall be pointed and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. 
9. Retests 
9 .1 If the results of the mechanical tests of any test lot do 
not conform to the requirements specified, the manufacturer 
may retreat such lot not more than twice, in which case two 
additional tension tests and one additional impact test consist­
ing of three specimens shall be made from such lot, all of 
which shall conform to the requirements specified. 
10. Nuts and Washers 
10.1 Bolts, studs, and stud bolts of Grades L7, L7A, L7B, 
L7C, L43, Ll, L70, L71, L72, and L73 shall be equipped with 
ferritic alloy nuts conforming to Grade 7 of Specification 
A194/A194M or conforming to Grade L43 or Grade L73. Nuts 
manufactured of Grade L43 and Grade L73, in addition to the 
requirements stated for those grades, shall be subject to the 
proof-load requirements for Grade 7 nuts. Nuts manufactured 
of Grade L43 and Grade L 73 shall be marked respectively with 
those grade symbols. Grade 7M nuts at a hardness not 
exceeding 235 HBW (or equivalent) shall be used with Grade 
L 7M bolts, studs, and stud bolts. All nut materials, including 
those which may be supplied under Specification A194/ 
A194M, shall be subject to the impact requirements of this 
specification in the following manner: impact tests shall be 
made on test specimens taken from the nuts or nut blanks or the 
bar from the heat of steel used for manufacturing the nuts, and 
heat treated with the nut blanks. 
10.2 Bolts, studs, and stud bolts of Grades B8, B8C, B8T, 
B8P, B8P, B8M, B8LN, and B8MLN shall be equipped with 
austenitic alloy nuts conforming to Grades 8, 8C, 8T, 8P, 8M, 
8LN, and 8MLN for Specification A194/A194M. Impact tests 
are not required for Grades 8P, 8M, 8T, and 8MLN for 
temperatures above -325 °P [-200 °C] and for Grades 8, 8P, 
8C, and 8LN above -425 °P [-255 °C]. 
10.3 If the purchaser requires nuts with a Charpy impact 
energy absorption of not less than 20 ft • lbf [27 J] at 
471 
temperatures below -150 °P [-100 °C], he may require that the 
nuts conform to Grades 8, 8C, 8M, 8P, 8T, 8P, 8LN, or 8MLN 
of Specification A194/A194M. 
10.4 Unless otherwise specified, washers for use with fer­
ritic steel bolting shall conform to Specification P436/F436M. 
10.5 Washers for use with austenitic steel bolting shall be 
made of austenitic steel as agreed upon between the manufac­
turer and purchaser. 
10.6 Washer dimensions shall be in accordance with re­
quirements of ASME B18.21.1, unless otherwise specified in 
the purchase order. 
11. Threads 
11.1 Where practical, all threads shall be formed after heat 
treatment. Class lA, Grades BSA, B8CA, B8MA, B8PA, 
B8PA, B8TA, B8LNA, and B8MLNA are to be solution­
treated in the finished condition. 
12. Certification 
12.1 Certification is required. See Specification A962/ 
A962M. 
13. Product Marking 
13.1 In addition to the requirements of Specification A962/ 
A962M, the grade symbol marked shall be as shown in Table 
3. In the case of Class 2, Grades B8, B8C, B8M, B8P, B8P, and 
B8T strain hardened as provided in Table 1, a line shall be 
stamped under the grade symbol in order to distinguish it from 
Class 1 and Class lA bolting which has not been strain 
hardened. In the case of Class IA, the marking BSA, B8CA, 
B8MA, B8PA, B8PA, B8TA, B8LNA, and B8MLNAidentifies 
the material as being in the solution-treated condition in the 
finished state. Grade L7M no longer requires a line under the 
grade symbol. However, a line is permitted. 
13.2 Nuts from materials that have been impact tested shall 
be marked with the letter "L."
