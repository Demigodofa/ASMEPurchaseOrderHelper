It is possible that steels of various compositions and \nprocessing histories will deviate in hardness-tensile strength relationship from the data presented in this table. The data in this table should not be used for austenitic \nstainless steels, but have been shown to be applicable for ferritic and martensitic stainless steels. The data in this table should not be used to establish a relationship \nbetween hardness values and tensile strength of hard drawn wire. Where more precise conversions are required, they should be developed specially for each steel \ncomposition, heat treatment, and part. \nTABLE 4 Approximate Hardness Conversion Numbers for Austenitic Steels (Rockwell C to other Hardness Numbers) \nRockwell Superficial Hardness \nRockwell C Scale, \u00b7150 kgf \nLoad, Diamond Penetrator \nRockwell A Scale, 60 kgf \nLoad, Diamond Penetrator 15N Scale, 15 kgf Load, \nDiamond Penetrator \n30N Scale, 30 kgf Load, \nDiamond Penetrator \n45N Scale, 45 kgf Load, \nDiamond Penetrator \n48 \n47 \n46 \n45 \n44 \n43 \n42 \n41 \n40 \n39 \n38 \n37 \n36 \n35 \n34 \n33 \n32 \n31 \n30 \n29 \n28 \n27 \n26 \n25 \n24 \n23 \n22 \n21 \n20 \n74.4 \n73.9 \n73.4 \n72.9 \n72.4 \n71.9 \n71.4 \n70.9 \n70.4 \n69.9 \n69.3 \n68.8 \n68.3 \n67.8 \n67.3 \n66.8 \n66.3 \n65.8 \n65.3 \n64.8 \n64.3 \n63.8 \n63.3 \n62.8 \n62.3 \n61.8 \n61.3 \n60.8 \n60.3 \n17.3 Test Specimen-Brinell hardness tests are made on \nprepared areas and sufficient metal must be removed from the \nsurface to eliminate decarburized metal and other surface \nirregularities. The thickness of the piece tested must be such \nthat no bulge or other marking showing the effect of the load \nappears on the side of the piece opposite the indentation. \n17.4 Procedure: \n17.4.1 It is essential that the applicable product specifica\u00ad\ntions state clearly the position at which Brinell hardness \nindentations are to be made and the number of such indenta\u00ad\ntions required. The distance of the center of the indentation \nfrom the edge of the specimen or edge of another indentation \nmust be at least two and one-half times the diameter of the \nindentation. \n84.1 \n83.6 \n83.1 \n82.6 \n82.1 \n81.6 \n81.0 \n80.5 \n80.0 \n79.5 \n79.0 \n78.5 \n78.0 \n77.5 \n77.0 \n76.5 \n75.9 \n75.4 \n74.9 \n74.4 \n73.9 \n73.4 \n72.9 \n72.4 \n71.9 \n71.3 \n70.8 \n70.3 \n69.8 \n598 \n66.2 \n65.3 \n64.5 \n63.6 \n62.7 \n61.8 \n61.0 \n60.1 \n59.2 \n58.4 \n57.5 \n56.6 \n55.7 \n54.9 \n54.0 \n53.1 \n52.3 \n51.4 \n50.5 \n49.6 \n48.8 \n47.9 \n47.0 \n46.2 \n45.3 \n44.4 \n43.5 \n42.7 \n41.8 \n17.4.2 Apply the load for 10 to 15 s. \n52.1 \n50.9 \n49.8 \n48.7 \n47.5 \n46.4 \n45.2 \n44.1 \n43.0 \n41.8 \n40.7 \n39.6 \n38.4 \n37.3 \n36.1 \n35.0 \n33.9 \n32.7 \n31.6 \n30.4 \n29.3 \n28.2 \n27.0 \n25.9 \n24.8 \n23.6 \n22.5 \n21.3 \n20.2 \n17.4.3 Measure diameters of the indentation in accordance \nwith Test Method ElO. \n17 .4.4 The Brinell hardness test is not recommended for \nmaterials above 650 HBW. \n17.4.4.1 If a ball is used in a test of a specimen which shows \na Brinell hardness number greater than the limit for the ball as \ndetailed in 17.4.4, the ball shall be either discarded and \nreplaced with a new ball or remeasured to ensure conformance \nwith the requirements of Test Method ElO. \n17 .5 Brinell Hardness Values: \n17.5.1 Brinell hardness values shall not be designated by a \nnumber alone because it is necessary to indicate which indenter \nand which force has been employed in making the test.
