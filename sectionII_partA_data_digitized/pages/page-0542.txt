SA-333/SA-333M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
actually tested. Appendix X 1 shows some examples of how the 
temperature reductions are determined. 
14.2 The notched bar impact test shall be made in accor­
dance with the procedure for the simple beam, Charpy-type test 
of Test Methods E23. 
14.3 Impact tests specified for temperatures lower than 70 
°F [20 °C] should be made with the following precautions. The 
impact test specimens as well as the handling tongs shall be 
cooled a sufficient time in a suitable container so that both 
reach the desired temperature. The temperature shall be mea­
sured with thennocouples, thermometers, or any other suitable 
devices and shall be controlled within 3 °F [2 °C]. The 
specimens shall be quickly transferred from the cooling device 
to the anvil of the Charpy impact testing machine and broken 
with a time lapse of not more than 5 s. 
15. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test 
15.l Each pipe shall be subjected to the nondestructive 
electric test or the hydrostatic test. The type of test to be used 
shall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order. 
15.2 The hydrostatic test shall be in accordance with Speci­
fication A999/A999M. 
15.3 Nondestructive Electric Test-Nondestructive electric 
tests shall be in accordance with Specification A999/ A999M, 
with the following addition: 
15.3.1 If the test signals were produced by visual imperfec­
tions (listed in 15.3.2), the pipe may be accepted based on 
visual examination, provided the imperfection is less than 
0.004 in. (0.1 mm) or 12½ % of the specified wall thickness 
(whichever is greater). 
15.3.2 Visual Imperfections: 
15.3.2.1 Scratches, 
15.3.2.2 Surface roughness, 
15.3.2.3 Dings, 
15.3.2.4 Straightener marks, 
15.3.2.5 Cutting chips, 
15.3.2.6 Steel die stamps, 
15.3.2.7 Stop marks, or 
15.3.2.8 Pipe reducer ripple. 
16. Product Marking 
16.1 Except as modified in 16.1.1, in addition to the 
marking prescribed in Specification A999/A999M, the mark­
ing shall include whether hot finished, cold drawn, seamless or 
welded, the schedule number and the letters "LT'' followed by 
the temperature at which the impact tests were made, except 
when a lower test temperature is required because of reduced 
specimen size, in which case, the higher impact test tempera­
ture applicable to a full-size specimen should be marked. 
16.1.1 When the size of the finished pipe is insufficient to 
obtain subsize impact specimens, the marking shall not include 
the letters "LT" followed by an indicated test temperature 
unless Supplementary Requirement Sl is specified. 
16.1.2 When the pipe is furnished in the quenched and 
tempered condition, the marking shall include the letters "QT," 
and the heat treatment condition shall be reported to the 
purchaser or his representative.

stainless steel pipe; steel pipe; temperature service applications 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirement shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the 
contract or order. 
Sl. Subsize Impact Specimens 
S 1.1 When the size of the finished pipe is insufficient to 
permit obtaining subsize impact specimens, testing shall be a 
matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the pur­
chaser. 
S2. Requirements for Pipe for Hydrofluoric Acid Alky­
lation Service 
S2.1 The carbon equivalent (CE), based on heat analysis, 
shall not exceed 0.43 % if the specified wall thickness is equal 
to or less than 1 in. [25.4 mm] or 0.45 % if the specified wall 
thickness is greater than 1 in. [25.4 mm]. 
S2.2 The carbon equivalent shall be determined using the 
following formula: 
CE = C + Mn/6 + (Cr + Mo + V)/5 + (Ni + Cu)/15 
490 
S2.3 Based upon heat analysis in mass percent, the vana­
dium content shall not exceed 0.02 %, the niobium content 
shall not exceed 0.02 % and the sum of the vanadium and 
niobium contents shall not exceed 0.03 %. 
S2.4 Based upon heat analysis in mass percent, the sum of 
the nickel and copper contents shall not exceed 0.15 %. 
S2.5 Based upon heat analysis in mass percent, the carbon 
content shall not be less than 0.18 %. 
S2.6 Welding consumables for repair welds shall be of low 
hydrogen type. E60XX electrodes shall not be used, and the 
resultant weld chemistry shall meet the chemical composition 
requirements specified for the pipe. 
S2.7 The designation "HF" shall be stamped or marked on 
each pipe to signify that the pipe complies with this supple­
mentary requirement.
