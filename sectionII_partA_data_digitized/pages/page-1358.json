General Requirements \n5.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con\u00ad\nform to the applicable requirements of the current edition of \nSpecification A999/ A999M unless otherwise provided herein. \n6. Materials and Manufacture \n6.1 Manufacture: \n6.1.1 The pipe shall be made by the seamless or an \nautomatic welding process, with no addition of filler metal in \nthe welding operation. \n6.1.2 At the manufacturer's option, pipe may be either \nhot-finished or cold-finished. \n6.1.3 The pipe shall be pickled free of scale. When bright \nannealing is used, pickling is not necessary. \n6.2 Discard-A sufficient discard shall be made from each \ningot to secure freedom from injurious piping and undue \nsegregation. \n6.3 Unless otherwise stated in the order, all pipe shall be \nfurnished in the heat-treated condition as shown in Table 1. \n6.3.1 For seamless pipe, as an alternate to final heat treat\u00ad\nment in a continuous furnace or batch-type furnace, immedi\u00ad\nately following hot forming while the temperature of the pipes \nis not less than the specified minimum solution treatment \ntemperature, pipes shall be individually quenched in water or \nrapidly cooled by other means, except for UNS S32950, which \nshall be air cooled. \n6.3.2 If the purchaser desires pipe without heat treatment \nsubsequent to welding, the purchase order shall specify the \nfollowing condition: \n6.3.2.1 No final heat treatment of pipe fabricated from plate \nthat has been heat treated as required by Table 1 for the \nparticular grade is required, provided a sample of that heat of \nfinished pipe or material representative of that heat of pipe as \na prolongation of the weld passes the Test Methods A923 \nMethod B or C (See Note 2), including base metal, weld metal, \nand heat affected zone per heat. Each pipe supplied under this \nrequirement shall be stenciled with the suffix \"HT-O.\" \n6.3.2.2 For materials not listed in Table 3 of Test Methods \nA923, the HT-O provision does not apply. \nNoTE 2-The Test Methods A923 test method (B or C) is at the \nmanufacturer's option, unless otherwise specified by the purchaser. \n7. Chemical Composition \n7 .1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements as \nprescribed in Table 2. \n8. Heat Analysis \n8.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the \nsteel manufacturer to determine the percentages of the ele\u00ad\nments specified. \n9. Product Analysis \n9.1 At the request of the purchaser's inspector, an analysis \nof one billet or one length of flat-rolled stock from each heat, \nor two pipes from each lot, shall be made by the manufacturer. \nA lot of pipe shall consist of the following number of lengths \nof the same size and wall thickness from any one heat of steel: \nNPS Designator \nUnder 2 \n2 to 5, incl \n6 and over \nLengths of Pipe in Lot \n400 or fraction thereof \n200 or fraction thereof \n1 00 or fraction thereof \n9.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the \npurchaser or the purchaser's representative and shall conform \nto the requirements specified in Section 7. \n9.3 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 8.1 or 9.1 \ndoes not conform to the requirements specified in Section 7, an \nanalysis of each billet or pipe from the same heat or lot may be \nmade, and all billets or pipe conforming to the requirements \nshall be accepted. \n10. Tensile and Hardness Properties \n10.1 The material shall conform to the tensile and hardness \nproperties prescribed in Table 3. \n11. Lengths \n11.1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following \nregular practice: \n11.1.1 Unless otherwise agreed upon, all sizes from NPS 1/s \nto and including NPS 8 are available in a length up to 24 ft (see \nNote 3) with the permissible range of 15 to 24 ft (see Note 3). \nShort lengths are acceptable and the number and minimum \nlength shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and the \npurchaser. \nNoTE 3-This value applies when the inch-pound designation of this \nspecification is the basis of purchase. When the M designation of this \nspecification is the basis of purchase, the corresponding metric value( s) \nshall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. \n11.1.2 If definite cut lengths are desired, the lengths re\u00ad\nquired shall be specified in the order. No pipe shall be less than \nthe specified length and no more than \u00bc in. [6 mm] over it. \n11.1.3 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise specified. \n12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n12.1 The finished pipes shall be reasonably straight and \nshall have a workmanlike finish. Imperfections may be re\u00ad\nmoved by grinding, provided the wall thicknesses are not \ndecreased to less than that permitted, in the Permissible \nVariations in Wall Thickness Section of Specification A999/ \nA999M. \n13. Mechanical Tests Required \n13.1 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One tension \ntest shall be made on a specimen for lots of not more than 100 \n1296 ",
