3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions: 
3.1.1 The definitions in Specification A999/ A999M and 
Terminology A941 are applicable to this specification. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 Orders for material to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of the current edition of Specification A999/ 
A999M. 
5. General Requirements 
5.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of the current edition of 
Specification A999/ A999M unless otherwise provided herein. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 Manufacture: 
6.1.1 The pipe shall be manufactured by one of the follow­
ing processes: 
6.1.2 Seamless (SML) pipe shall be made by a process that 
does not involve welding at any stage of production. 
6.1.3 Welded (WLD) pipe shall be made using an automatic 
welding process with no addition of filler metal during the 
welding process. 
6.1.4 Heavily cold-worked (HCW) pipe shall be made by 
applying cold working of not less than 35 % reduction in 
thickness of both wall and weld to a welded pipe prior to the 
final anneal. No filler shall be used in making the weld. Prior 
to cold working, the weld shall be 100 % radiographically 
inspected in accordance with the requirements of ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1, latest 
revision, Paragraph UW-51. 
6.1.5 Welded pipe and HCW pipe of NPS 14 and smaller 
shall have a single longitudinal weld. Welded pipe and HCW 
pipe of a size larger than NPS 14 shall have a single 
longitudinal weld or shall be produced by forming and welding 
two longitudinal sections of flat stock when approved by the 
purchaser. All weld tests, examinations, inspections, or treat­
ments shall be performed on each weld seam. 
6.1.6 At the option of the manufacturer, pipe shall be either 
hot finished or cold finished. 
6.1.7 The pipe shall be free of scale and contaminating 
exogenous iron particles. Pickling, blasting, or surface finish­
ing is not mandatory when pipe is bright annealed. The 
purchaser is permitted to require that a passivating treatment be 
applied to the finished pipe.

6.2 Heat Treatment-All pipe shall be furnished in the 
heat-treated condition in accordance with the requirements of 
Table 2. Alternatively, for seamless pipe, immediately follow­
ing hot forming while the temperature of the pipes is not less 
than the minimum solution treatment temperature specified in 
Table 2, pipes shall be individually quenched in water or 
rapidly cooled by other means (direct quenched). 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
8. Product Analysis 
8.1 At the request of the purchaser, an analysis of one billet 
or one length of flat-rolled stock from each heat, or two pipes 
from each lot shall be made by the manufacturer. A lot of pipe 
shall consist of the following number of lengths of the same 
size and wall thickness from any one heat of steel: 
NPS Designator 
Under 2 
2 to 5 
6 and over 
Lengths of Pipe in Lot 
400 or fraction thereof 
200 or fraction thereof 
100 or fraction thereof 
8.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the 
purchaser or the purchaser's representative, and shall conform 
to the requirements specified in Section 7. 
8.3 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 8.1 does 
not conform to the requirements specified in Section 7, an 
analysis of each billet or pipe from the same heat or lot may be 
made, and all billets or pipe conforming to the requirements 
shall be accepted. 
9. Permitted Variations in Wall Thickness 
9.1 In addition to the implicit limitation of wall thickness 
for seamless pipe imposed by the limitation on weight in 
Specification A999/ A999M, the wall thickness for seamless 
and welded pipe at any point shall be within the tolerances 
specified in Table 3, except that for welded pipe the weld area 
shall not be limited by the "Over" tolerance. The wall thickness 
and outside diameter for inspection for compliance with this 
requirement for pipe ordered by NPS and schedule number is 
shown in Table Xl.1. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 The tensile properties of the material shall conform to 
the requirements prescribed in Table 4. 
453 
11. Mechanical Tests, Grain Size Determinations, and 
Weld Decay Tests Required 
11.1 Mechanical Testing Lot Definition-The term lot for 
mechanical tests shall be as follows: 
11.1.1 Where the final heat treated condition is obtained, 
consistent with the requirements of 6.2, in a continuous furnace 
or by quenching after hot forming, the term lot for mechanical 
tests shall apply to all pipes of the same specified outside 
diameter and specified wall thickness ( or schedule) of the same 
heat, heat treated in the same furnace at the same temperature, 
time at heat, and furnace speed in the same production run, or 
all pipes of the same specified outside diameter and specified
