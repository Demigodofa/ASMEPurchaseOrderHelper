[mm] \n0.010 [0.25] \n0.016 [0.41] \nintended purpose. Surface defects that violate minimum wall \nrequirements shall be cause for rejection. \nNoIB 1-Ferritic stainless steels may be expanded by other methods but \nthe user should exercise precautions when using methods other than roll \nexpansion as these grades have a higher ductile-brittle transition \ntemperature, are more strain rate sensitive, and have lower ductility than \naustenitic grades. \n13.2 The residual chloride salt contamination of the inside \nand outside surface of the tubing at the time of packing for \nshipment from the mill shall not exceed a concentration of l \nmg/ft 2 [10.7 mg/m 2 ] of tube surface. One tube in each 500 \npieces shall be checked immediately prior to packing for \nshipment for chloride salt contamination by a procedure agreed \nto between the manufacturer and purchaser. \n14. Surface Condition \n14.1 The straight tubes, after final annealing, shall be \npickled using a solution of nitric and hydrofluoric acids \nfollowed by flushing and rinsing in water. If bright-annealing is \nperformed, this requirement does not apply. \n14.1.1 All tubes shall be free of excessive mill scale, \nsuitable for inspection. A slight amount of oxidation will not be \nconsidered as scale. Any special finish requirements shall be \nsubject to agreement between the manufacturer and the pur\u00ad\nchaser. \n14.2 A light oxide scale on the outside surface of U-bend \narea shall be pennitted for tubes that have been electric\u00ad\nresistan.ce heat treated after bending. \n15. Nondestructive Test (Electric Test) \n15.1 Each straight tube shall be tested after the finish heat \ntreatment by passing it through a nondestructive tester capable \nof detecting defects on the entire cross section of the tube in \naccordance with Specification A1016/A1016M. \n16. Inspection \n16.l The inspector representing the purchaser shall have \nentry, at all times, to those areas where inspection and testing \nis being performed on the purchaser's ordered material. The \nmanufacturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities \nto satisfy the inspector that the material is being furnished in \naccordance with this specification. All required tests and \ninspections shall be made at the place of manufacture prior to \nshipment, unless otherwise specified, and shall be conducted so \nas not to interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the \nworks. \n17. Rejection \n17 .1 Each length of tubing received from the manufacturer \nmay be inspected by the purchaser, and, if it does not meet the \nrequirements of the specification based on the inspection and \ntest method outlined in the specification, the tubing may be \nrejected and the manufacturer shall be notified. Disposition of \nrejected tubing shall be a matter of agreement between the \nmanufacturer and the purchaser. \n17 .2 Material that fails in any of the fanning operations or \nin the process of installation and is found to be defective, shall \nbe set aside, and the manufacturer shall be notified. Disposition \nof such material shall be a matter for agreement between the \nmanufacturer and the purchaser. \n18. Certification \n18.1 A test report, signed by an authorized employee or \nrepresentative of the manufacturer, shall be furnished to the \npurchaser to indicate the specification and grade, seamless or \nwelded, the results of the heat analysis, hardness, and tensile \nproperties. Product analysis will be repmted only when re\u00ad\nquested on the purchase order as provided in 9 .1.1. \n19. Product Marking \n19 .1 All tubes shall be marked with the heat number. \n19.2 Containers and packages shall be marked or tagged to \nshow the purchaser's order number, the manufacturer's order \nnumber, specification, seamless or welded, grade, size and wall \nthickness, minimum or average, number of pieces contained in \nthe package, and item number (if appropriate). \n20. Packaging \n20.1 All tubing shall be packaged and blocked in such a \nmanner as to prevent damage in ordinary handling and trans\u00ad\nportation. The boxes shall be constructed in such a manner that \nno nails, staples, screws, or similar fasteners are required to \nclose and secure the box after the tubes have been placed in the \nbox. The box shall be lined with plastic sheet or vapor barrier \nmaterials so as to prevent chloride contamination of the tube \nduring handling, transportation, and storage. \n20.2 The U-bent tubes shall be arranged in boxes so that the \nsmaller radius bends may be removed without disturbing larger \nradius bends. Tubes for an item number shall be boxed \ntogether. \n21.
