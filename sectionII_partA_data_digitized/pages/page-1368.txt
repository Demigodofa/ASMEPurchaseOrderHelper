SA-803/SA-803M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless and Welded Ferritic Stainless Steel Feedwater 
Heater Tubes 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers seamless and welded ferritic 
stainless steel feedwater heater tubes including those bent, if 
specified, into the form of U-tubes for application in tubular 
feedwater heaters. 
1.2 The tubing .sizes covered shall be 5/s to 1 in. [15.9 to 25.4 
mm] inclusive outside diameter, and average or minimum wall 
thicknesses of 0.028 in. [0.7 mm] and heavier. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard.

4. Ordering Information 
4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for material under this speci­
fication. Such requirements may include, but are not limited to, 
the following: 
4.1.1 Quantity (length or number of pieces), 
4.1.2 Material description (seamless or welded), 
4.1.3 Dimensions (outside diameter, wall thickness (mini­
mum or average wall), and length), 
4.1.4 Grade (chemical composition) (Table 1), and 
4.1.5 U-bend requirements, if order specifies bending, 
U-bend schedules or drawings shall accompany the order. 
4.2 Optional Requirements-Purchaser shall specify 
whether annealing of the U-bends is required or whether tubes 
are to be hydrotested or air-tested (see 10.6). 
4.3 Supplementary Requirements-Purchaser shall specify 
on this purchase order if material is to be eddy-current tested in 
accordance with Supplementary Requirement S 1 or S2, and if 
special test reports are required, under Supplementary Require­
ment S3, and, 
4.4 Any additional special requirements. 
5. General Requirements 
5.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the applicable requirements of the latest published edition of 
Specification A1016/Al016M unless otherwise provided 
herein. 
6. Materials and Manufacture 
6.1 The tubing shall be manufactured by either the seamless 
or welded process. 
6.2 Seamless Tubing: 
6.2.1 Seamless tubing shall be supplied from a cold finish 
process. Hot finishing as the final sizing process is not allowed. 
6.3 Welded Tubing: 
6.3.1 The tube shall be made from flat-rolled steel by an 
automatic welding process with no addition of filler metal. 
6.4 Surface contaminants may have detrimental effects on 
high temperature properties or corrosion resistance of tubing. 
Contamination by copper, lead, mercury, zinc, chlorides, or
