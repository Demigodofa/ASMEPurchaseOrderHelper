SA-738/SA-738M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Heat-Treated, Carbon-Manganese­
Silicon Steel, for Moderate and Lower Temperature Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers heat-treated carbon­
manganese-silicon steel plates intended for use in welded 
pressure vessels at moderate and lower temperature service. 
1.2 Material under this specification is available in four 
strength levels, 75 ksi [515 MPa], 85 ksi [585 MPa], 80 ksi 
[550 MPa], and 90 ksi [620 MPa] minimum ultimate tensile 
strengths. 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates for Grades A, B, and 
C is limited only by the capacity of the chemical composition 
and heat treatment to meet the specified mechanical property 
requirements; however, current practice normally limits the 
maximum thickness of plates furnished under this specification 
to 6 in. [150 mm] for Grade A, 4 in. [100 mm] for Grade B, and 
6 in. [150 mm] for Grade C. The maximum permitted nominal 
thickness is 1.5 in. [40 mm] for Grade D and 2 in. [50 mm] for 
Grade E. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. 
2. Referenced Documents 
2.1 ASTM Standards: 
A20/ A20M Specification for General Requirements for Steel 
Plates for Pressure Vessels 
3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and 
shall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of 
Specification A20/ A20M. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 Grade A plates 2.5 in. [65 mm] and under in thickness 
shall be supplied in the normalized condition or in the 
quenched and tempered condition at the option of the manu­
facturer. 
5.2 Grade A plates over 2.5 in. [65 mm] in thickness and 
Grade B, Grade C, Grade D, and Grade E plates in all 
thicknesses shall be quenched-and-tempered.
