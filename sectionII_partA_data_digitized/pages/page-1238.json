Scope \n1.1 This specification covers a group of common require\u00ad\nments that, unless otherwise specified in an individual \nspecification, shall apply to steel castings for pressure\u00ad\ncontaining parts under each of the following ASTM specifica\u00ad\ntions: \nTitle of Specification ASTM Designation \nSteel Castings, Carbon, Suitable for Fusion Welding, A216/A216M \nfor High-Temperature Service \nSteel Castings, Martensitic Stainless and Alloy, for A217/A217M \nPressure-Containing Parts, Suitable for High-\nTemperature Service \nCastings, Austenitic, for Pressure-Containing A351/A351 M \nParts \nSteel Castings, Ferritic and Martensitic, for Pressure- A352/A352M \nContaining Parts, Suitable for Low-Temperature \nService \nSteel Castings, Alloy, Specially Heat-Treated, for A389/A389M \nPressure-Containing Parts, Suitable for High-\nTemperature Service \nSteel Castings Suitable for Pressure Service A487/A487M \nCastings, Iron-Nickel-Chromium and Nickel A990/A990M \nAlloys, Specially Controlled for Pressure Retaining \nParts for Corrosive Service \nCastings, Austenltic-Ferritic (Duplex) A995/A995M \nStainless Steel, for Pressure-Containing Parts \n1.2 This specification also covers a group of supplementary \nrequirements which may be applied to the above specifications \nas indicated therein. These are provided for use when addi\u00ad\ntional testing or inspection is desired and apply only when \nspecified individually by the purchaser in the order. \n1.3 In case of conflict between the requirements of the \nindividual specification and this general specification, the \nformer shall prevail. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in nonconformance \nwith the standard. \nl.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
