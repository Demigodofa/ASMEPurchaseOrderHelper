SA-209 /SA-209M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless Carbon-Molybdenum Alloy-Steel Boiler and 
Superheater Tubes 
l. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers several grades of minimum­
wall-thickness, seamless, carbon-molybdenum alloy-steel, 
boiler and superheater tubes. 
1.2 This specification covers tubes l/2 to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 
mm] inclusive, in outside diameter and 0.035 to 0.500 in. [0.9 
to 12.7 mm], inclusive, in minimum wall thickness. 
1.3 An optional supplementary requirement is provided and, 
when desired, shall be so stated in the order. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
2. Referenced Documents 
2.1 ASTM Standards: 
Al016/Al016M Specification for General Requirements for 
Ferritic Alloy Steel, Austenitic Alloy Steel, and Stainless 
Steel Tubes 
3. General Requirements 
3J Product furnished under this specification shall conform 
to the requirements of Specification A1016/A1016M, includ-
ing any supplementary requirements that are indicated in the 
purchase order. Failure to comply with the general require­
ments of Specification A1016/Al016M constitutes nonconfor­
mance with this specification. In case of conflict with the 
requirements of this specification and Specification Al016/ 
Al016M, this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice--The steel shall be killed. 
4.2 The tubes shall be made by the seamless process and 
shall be either hot-finished or cold-finished, as specified. 
4.3 Heat Treatment-Hot-finished tubes shall be heat treated 
at a temperature of 1200 °F [650 °C] or higher. Cold-finished 
tubes shall, after the final cold finishing, be heat treated at a 
temperature of 1200 °F [650 °C] or higher, or tubing may be 
furnished in the full-annealed, isothermal annealed, or nonnal­
ized and tempered condition. If furnished in the normalized 
and tempered condition, the minimum tempering temperature 
shall be 1200 °F [ 650 °C]. 
5. Chemical Composition 
270 
5 .1 The steel shall conform to the requirements given in 
Table L 
5.2 Product Analysis 
5.2.1 An analysis shall be made by the manufacturer of one 
billet or one tube from each heat. The chemical composition 
thus determined, shall conform to the requirements given in 
Table 1. 
5.2.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of 
two additional billets or tubes shall be made. Both retests for 
the elements in question shall meet the requirements of the 
specification; otherwise all remaining material in the heat or lot 
(See 7.1) shall be rejected or, at the option of the producer, each 
billet or tube may be individually tested for acceptance. Billets 
or tubes that do not meet the requirements of the specification 
shall be rejected.
