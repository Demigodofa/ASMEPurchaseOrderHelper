3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 The inquiry and orders shall include the following, as 
required, to describe the desired bolting material or bolting 
components adequately: 
3.1.1 Heat-treated condition (that is carbide solution treated 
(Class 1), carbide solution treated after finishing (Class lA), 
and carbide solution treated and strain-hardened (Classes 2, 2B 
and 2C), for the austenitic stainless steels; Classes 1B and lC 
apply to the carbide solution-treated nitrogen-bearing stainless 
steels; Class lD applies to bolting material that is carbide 
solution treated by cooling rapidly from the rolling 
temperature), 
3.1.2 Description of items required (that is, bars, bolts, 
screws, or studs), 
3.1.3 Nuts, if required by purchaser, in accordance with 
13.1, 
3.1.4 Supplementary requirements, if any, and 
3.1.5 Special requirements, in accordance with 6.1.5.1, 
6.2.6, 8.1, and 13.1. 
3.2 Coatings-Coatings are prohibited unless specified by 
the purchaser (See Supplementary Requirements S13 and Sl4). 
When coated bolting components are ordered the purchaser 
should take special care to ensure that Appendix X2 is 
thoroughly understood. 
4. Common Requirements 
4.1 Bolting materials and bolting components supplied to 
this specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci­
fication A962/ A962M. These requirements include test 
methods, finish, thread dimensions, macroetch (alloy steels 
only), marking, certification, optional supplementary 
requirements, and others. Failure to comply with the require­
ments of Specification A962/ A962M constitutes nonconfor­
mance with this specification. In case of conflict between this 
specification and Specification A962/A962M, this specification 
shall prevail. 
5. Manufacture (Process) 
5.1 Melting-See Specification A962/A962M for require­
ments. 
5.2 Quality-See Specification A962/A962M for require­
ments. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 Ferritic Steels: 
6.1.1 Ferritic steels shall be allowed to cool to a temperature 
• below the cooling transformation range immediately after 
rolling or forging. Bolting materials shall then be uniformly 
reheated to the proper temperature to refine the grain (a group 
thus reheated being lmown as a quenching charge), quenched
