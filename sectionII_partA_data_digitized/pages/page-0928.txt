SA-487 /SA-487M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Steel Castings Suitable for Pressure Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers low-alloy steels and marten­
sitic stainless steels in the normalized and tempered, or 
quenched and tempered, condition suitable for pressure­
containing parts. The weldability of the classes in this speci­
fication varies from readily weldable to weldable only with 
adequate precautions, and the weldability of each class should 
be considered prior to assembly by fusion welding. 
1.2 Selection will depend on design, mechanical, and ser­
vice conditions. Users should note that hardenability of some 
of the grades mentioned may restrict the maximum size at 
which the required mechanical properties are obtained. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
• are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. C9mbining 
values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the standard. 
1.3.1 Within the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Conditions for Delivery 
3.1 Except for investment castings, castings furnished to 
this specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci-
- fl.cation A703/A703M, including any supplementary require­
ments that are indicated in the purchase order. Failure to 
comply with the general requirements of Specification A 703/ 
A 703M constitutes nonconformance with this specification. In 
case of conflict between the requirements of this specification 
and Specification A703/A703M, this specification shall pre­
vail.

3.2 Investment castings furnished to this specification shall 
conform to the requirements of Specification A985/A985M, 
including any supplementary requirements that are indicated in 
the purchase order. Failure to comply with the general require­
ments of Specification A985/A985M constitutes nonconfor­
mance with this specification. In case of conflict between the 
requirements of this specification and Specification A985/ 
A985M, Specification A985/ A985M shall prevail.
