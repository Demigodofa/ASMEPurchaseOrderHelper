ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
In addition, the following supplementary requirement is suitable for this application. 
S54. Requirements for Carbon Steel Plate for Hydrofluoric 
Acid Aikylation Service 
S54.l Plates shall be provided in the normalized heat­
treated condition. 
S54.2 The maximum carbon equivalent (CE) shall be as 
follows: 
Plate thickness less than or equal to 1 in. [25 mm]: 
CE maximum = 0.43 
Plate thickness greater than 1 in. [25 mm]: 
CE maximum= 0.45 
S54.3 Determine the CE as follows: 
CE= C+Mn/6+(Cr+Mo+V)/5+(Ni+Cu)/l5 
Maximum niobium = 0.02 % 
Maximum vanadium plus niobium= 0.03 % 
(Note: niobium= columbium.) 
S54.5 The maximum composition based on heat analysis of 
ni~kel (Ni) plus copper (Cu) shall be 0.15 %. 
S54.6 The minimum carbon (C) content based on heat 
analysis shall be 0.18 %. The maximum C content shall be as 
specified for the ordered grade. 
S54.7 Welding consumables for repair welds shall be of the 
low-hydrogen type. E60XX electrodes shall not be used and 
the resulting weld chemistry shall meet the same chemistry 
requirements as the base metal. 
S54.4 Vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb) maximum content 
based on heat analysis shall be: 
S54.8 In addition to the requirements for product marking in 
the specification, an "HF-N" stamp or marking shall be 
provided on each plate to identify that the plate complies with_
