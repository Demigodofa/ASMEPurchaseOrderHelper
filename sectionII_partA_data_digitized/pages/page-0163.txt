is being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's works 
that concern the manufacture of the material ordered. The 
manufacturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities 
to satisfy him that the material is being furnished in accordance 
with this specification. All tests (except product analysis) and 
inspection shall be made at the place of manufacture prior to 
shipment, unless otherwise specified, and shall be so conducted 
as not to interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the 
works. 
10.2 All required tests and inspection shall be made by the 
manufacturer prior to shipment. 
11. Rejection 
11.1 Unless otherwise specified, any rejection because of 
noncompliance to the requirements of the specification shall be 
reported by the purchaser to the manufacturer within 30 
working days after receipt of samples. 
11.2 Material that shows imperfections capable of adversely 
affecting processibility subsequent to its acceptance at the 
purchaser's works will be rejected, and the manufacturer shall 
be notified. 
12. Rehearing 
12.1 Samples that represent rejected material shall be pre­
served for two weeks from the date rejection is reported to the 
manufacturer. In case of dissatisfaction with the results of the 
tests, the manufacturer may make claim for a rehearing within 
that time. 
13. Product Marking 
13.1 Civilian Procurement-Bars of all sizes, when loaded 
for shipment, shall be properly identified with the name or 
brand of manufacturer, purchaser's name and order number, 
the ASTM designation (year date is not required), grade 
number where appropriate, size and length, weight of lift, and 
the heat number for identification. Unless otherwise specified, 
the method of marking is at the manufacturer's option and may 
be made by hot stamping, cold stamping, painting, or marking 
tags attached to the lifts of bars. 
111 
13.1.1 Bar code marking may be used as an auxiliary 
method of identification. Such bar-code markings shall be of 
the 3-of-9 type and shall conform toAlAG Bl. When barcoded 
tags are used, they shall conform to AIAG BS. 
13.2 Government Procurement: 
13.2.1 Marking for shipment shall be in accordance with the 
requirements specified in the contract or order and shall be in 
accordance with MIL-STD-163 for military agencies and in 
accordance with Fed. Std. No. 123 for civil agencies. 
13.2.2 For government procurement by the Defense Supply 
Agency, the bars shall be continuously marked for identifica­
tion in accordance with Fed. Std. No. 183. 
14. Packaging 
14.1 Civilian Procurement-Unless otherwise specified, the 
bars shall be packaged and loaded in accordance with Guide 
A700. 
14.2 Government Procurement-MIL-STD-163 shall apply 
when packaging is specified in the contract or order, or when 
Level A for preservation, packaging, and packing is specified 
for direct procurement by or direct shipment to the govern­
ment.
