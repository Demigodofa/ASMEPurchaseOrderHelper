[10 mm] minimum edge distance (see Supplementary \nRequirement in Specifications A568/A568M or A635/A635M, \nas applicable), this requirement shall be specified in the \npurchase order or contract. \nNorn 1-Not all producers are capable of meeting all of the limitations \nof the thickness tolerance tables in Specification A568/A568M or Speci\u00ad\nfication A635/A635M. The purchaser should contact the producer regard\u00ad\ning possible limitations prior to placing an order. \n4.1.6 Cast or heat analysis, or test report request, or both, if \nrequired. \nNorn 2-A typical ordering description is as follows: \"ASTM A414, \nGrade A, Hot-Rolled Sheet, 0.100 in. [2.54 mm] by 36 in. [914.4 mm] by \n96 in. [2438 mm], cut edges.\" \n5. Chemical Requirements \n5.1 Cast or Heat Analysis-The analysis of the steel shall \nconform to the requirements prescribed in Table 1. \n5 .1.1 Each of the elements listed in Table 2 shall be included \nin the report of the heat analysis. When the amount of an \nelement present is less than 0.02 %, the analysis may be \nreported as \"<0.02 %.\" \nTABLE 2 Limits on Unspecified Elements (See 5.1.1) \nCopper, max %A Heat analysis 0.40 \nProduct analysis 0.43 \nNickel, max %A Heat analysis 0.40 \nProduct analysis 0.43 \nChromium, max %A.a Heat analysis 0.30 \nProduct analysis 0.34 \nMolybdenum, max %A.a Heat analysis 0.12 \nProduct analysis 0.13 \nVanadium, max %c Heat analysis 0.03 \nProduct analysis 0.04 \nColumbium, max %c Heat analysis 0.02 \nProduct analysis 0.03 \nA The sum of copper, nickel, chromium, and molybdenum shall not exceed 1.00 % \non heat analysis. When one or more of these elements are specified, the sum does \nnot apply, in which case, only the individual limits on the remaining unspecified \nelements will apply. \na The sum of chromium and molybdenum shall not exceed 0.32 % on heat \nanalysis. When one or more of these elements are specified, the sum does not \napply, in which case, only the individual limits on the remaining unspecified \nelements will apply. \nc By agreement, the heat analysis limits for vanadium or columbium, or both, may \nbe increased up to 0.1 O % and 0.05 %, respectively. \n5.2 Product, Check, or Verification Analysis-Analyses may \nbe made by the purchaser from finished material representing \neach heat. \n5.3 Deoxidation-For all grades, killed steel is required. \nSee Table 1 and footnote B. \n6. Mechanical Property Reqnirements \n6.1 Tensile Strength: \n6.1.1 Requirements-Material as represented by the test \nspecimen shall conform to the tensile requirements specified in \nTable 3. One coil per lot shall have test specimens taken from \nlocations representing the front end, middle, and back end of \nthe coil. If all tensile results conform to the requirements, other \ncoils of that lot may be tested only at the middle position. \n6.1.2 Location and Orientation (see Fig. 1): \nTABLE 1 Chemical Requirements \n% Heat Analysis, Element Maximum Unless Otherwise Shown \nGrade C MnA p s Ala Sia Cu\u00b7 Ni 0 CrD,E MoD,E V Cb TiF D N B \nA 0.15 0.90 0.035 0.035 0.02-0.08 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.12 0.03 0.02 0.025 \nB 0.22 0.90 0.035 0.035 0.02-0.08 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.12 0.03 0.02 0.025 \nC 0.25 0.90 0.035 0.035 0.02-0.08 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.12 0.03 0.02 0.025 \nD 0.25 1.20 0.035 0.035 0.02-0.08 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.12 0.03 0.02 0.025 \nE 0.27 1.20 0.035 0.035 0.02-0.08 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.12 0.03 0.02 0.025 \nF 0.31 1.20 0.035 0.035 0.02-0.08 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.12 0.03 0.02 0.025 \nG 0.31 1.35 0.035 0.035 0.02-0.08 0.30 0.40 0.40 0.30 0.12 0.03 0.02 0.025 \nHA,G 0.14 1.25 0.020 0.015 0.02-0.08 0.30 0.20 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.05 0.005/ 0.005 0.009 \nmin 0.05 min \nA For each reduction of 0.01 % below the specified carbon maximum, an increase of 0.06 % manganese above the specified maximum wll be permitted up to a maximum \nof 1.50 %. \na The steel shall be considered aluminum-silicon killed when the silicon is between 0.15 % and 0.30 %, otherwise it shall be considered aluminum killed. \nc When copper is specified, a minimum of 0.20 % is required.
