Scope \n1.1 This specification covers iron-chromium-nickel\u00ad\ncopper corrosion-resistant steel castings, capable of being \nstrengthened by precipitation hardening heat treatment. \n1.2 These castings may be used in services requiring \ncorrosion resistance and high strengths at temperatures up \nto 600\u00b0F [315\u00b0C]. They may be machined in the solution\u00ad\nannealed condition and subsequently precipitation hard\u00ad\nened to the desired high-strength mechanical properties \nspecified in Table Sl4.l with little danger of cracking or \ndistortion. \n1.3 The material is not intended for use in the solution\u00ad\nannealed condition. \nNOTE 1 - If the service environment in which the material is to be \nused is considered conducive to stress-corrosion cracking, precipitation \nhardening should be performed at a temperature that will minimize the \nsusceptibility of the material to this type of attack. \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \nunits are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the \ntext, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated \nin each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem must be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in nonconformance \nwith the specification. \n2.

General Conditions for Delivery \n3.1 Material furnished to this specification shall be in \naccordance with the requirements of Specification \nA 781/ A 781M, including any supplementary require\u00ad\nments that are indicated in the purchase order. Failure \nto comply with the general requirements of Specification \nA 781/ A 781M constitutes nonconformance with this \nspecification. In case of conflict between the requirements \nof this specification and Specification A 781 / A 78 lM, this \nspecification shall prevail. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 Orders for material to this specification should \ninclude the following: \n4.1.1 Specification number and grade (Table 1), \n4.1.2 Heat treatment condition (SA, H900, and so \nforth), Table 2, \n4.1.3 Drawing or pattern, \n4.1.4 Options in the specification, if any, in accor\u00ad\ndance with 5.2, 6.3, and Section 7, and \n4.1.5 Supplementary requirements, if any, including \nthe standards of acceptance. \n4.1.6 Supplementary Requirements S6, S 14, and S27 \nare mandatory, together with S15 from Specification \n1212 ",
