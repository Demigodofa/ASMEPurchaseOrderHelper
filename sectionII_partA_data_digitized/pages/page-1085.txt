9.5.1 The term cut edge refers to the edge resulting from 
trimming the hot-rolled mill edge that is formed during the 
hot-rolling process. At the producer's option, the edge shall be 
trimmed at any process step after the hot-rolling process step to 
the final process step.

TABLE 11 Out-of-Square Tolerances of Hot-Rolled Cut-Edge 
(Including Pickled) and Cold-Rolled Sheet (All Designations) 
(Cut Lengths) 
Out-of-square is the greatest deviation of an end edge from a straight line at 
right angle to a side and touching one corner. It is also obtained by measuring 
the difference between the diagonals of the cut length. The out-of-square 
deviation is one half of that difference. The tolerance for all thicknesses and all 
sizes is 1/16 in./6 in. of width or fraction thereof. 
TABLE 12 Restricted Squareness Tolerances of Hot-Rolled 
(Including Pickled) and Cold-Rolled Sheet (All Designations) 
(Cut Lengths) 
When cut lengths are specified restricted squareness, the width and the length 
are not less than the dimensions specified. The individual tolerance for over­
-width;-over-lengtl1, camt>er, Gr-out--0f-square sbould_n_ot exceed_1Lw i11._Jjp_tQ__Jind _ 
including 48 in. in width and up to and including 120 in. in length. For cut 
lengths wider or longer, the applicable tolerance is 1/s in. 
9.5.1.1 The term slit last edge is a cut edge that was 
edge-trimmed at the final process step. 
985 
( 1) If the purchaser requires the edge to be trimmed at the 
final process step, the term slit last edge shall be shown on the 
purchase order. 
(2) If the producer decides to trim the edge at the final 
process step, without being required by the purchaser, the term 
slit last edge is not required, since this condition falls under the 
term cut edge as described in 9.5.1. 
9.6 Oiling: 
9.6.1 Plain hot-rolled sheet is customarily furnished not 
oiled. Oiling must be specified, when required.
