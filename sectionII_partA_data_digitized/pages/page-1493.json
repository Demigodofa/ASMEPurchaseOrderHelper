Terminology \n3.1 Definitions - The definitions in Test Methods and \nDefinitions A 370 and Terminology A 941 are applicable \nto this specification and those listed in 1.1. \n3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.2.1 heat, n - all the molten metal poured from a \nsingle furnace or all of the molten metal from two or more \nfurnaces poured into a single ladle or casting prior to the \nreplenishing of the furnace(s). \n3.2.2 investment casting, n - a metal casting that is \nproduced in a mold obtained by investing (surrounding) \nan expendable pattern with a ceramic slurry, which is \nallowed to solidify. The expendable pattern may consist \nof wax, plastic, or other material and is removed prior to \nfilling the mold with liquid metal. \n3.2.3 master heat, n - a single furnace charge of \nalloy that may be either poured directly into castings or \ninto remelt alloy for individual melts. \n3.2.4 subheat, n - a portion of master heat remelted \nwith only minor additions for deoxidation for pouring into \ncastings. Syn. melt, production heat. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Melting Process - Master heats shall be made by \nthe electric furnace process with or without separate refin\u00ad\ning such as argon-oxygen-decarburization (AOD), vac\u00ad\nuum-oxygen-degassing (VOD), vacuum-induction\u00ad\nmelting (VIM), and so forth, unless otherwise specified in \nthe individual specification or agreed upon between the \ncustomer and producer. Master heats may be used directly \nfor producing castings or converted into ingot, bar, shot, \nor other suitable form, not including gates and risers from \ncasting production, for later remelting as a subheat. \n4.2 Re-Melting Process - Subheats shall be produced \nfrom master heat metal in suitable batch sizes by electric \ninduction furnace, with or without atmosphere protection, \nsuch as vacuum or inert gas unless otherwise agreed upon \nbetween the customer and producer. Revert (gates, sprues, \nrisers, and rejected castings) shall not be remelted except \nin master heats. \n4.3 Heat Treatment: \n4.3.1 Ferritic and martensitic steel shall be cooled \nafter pouring to provide substantially complete transforma\u00ad\ntion of austenite prior to heat treatment to enhance mechani\u00ad\ncal properties. \n4.3.2 Castings shall be heat treated in the working \nzone of a furnace that has been surveyed in accordance \nwith Test Method A 991/A 991M. \n1435 ",
