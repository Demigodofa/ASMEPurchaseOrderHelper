8 Elongation not required to be determined for floor plate. 
c For wide flange shapes over 426 lb/ft [634 kg/m], elongation in 2 in. [50 mm] of 
19 % minimum applies. 
° For plates wider than 24 in. [600 mm], the elongation requirement is reduced two 
percentage points for Grades 42, 50, and 55 [290, 345, and 380], and three 
percentage points for Grades 60 and 65 [415 and 450]. See elongation require­
ment adjustments in the Tension Tests section of Specification A6/A6M. 
7. Test Reports 
7 .1 In addition to the Test Reports requirements in Specifi­
cation A6/A6M, when Specification A588/A588M is substi­
tuted for Specification A572/ A572M, the test report shall 
include the statement "Specification A588/A588M substi­
tuted."

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
Supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the order or contract. Standardized 
supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser are listed in Specification A6/ A6M. 
Those that are considered suitable for use with this specification are listed by title: 
S5. Charpy V-Notch Impact Test. 
S18. Maximum Tensile Strength 
S30. Charpy V-Notch Impact Test for Structural Shapes: Alternate Core Location 
S32. Single Heat Bundles. 
In addition, the following supplementary requirements are suitable for use: 
S81. Tensile Strength S99. Interlock Strength 
S81.l For Grade 50 [345) steel of thicknesses ¾ in. [20 
mm] and less, the tensile strength shall be a minimum of 70 ksi 
[485 MPa]. 
S90. Type 
S90.1 The specific type of steel shall be as specified by the 
purchaser in the order or contract. 
S99.1 The minimum strength of the interlocked joint re­
quired for certain services may be specified for straight web 
(PS type) and arched web (PSA type) sheet piling sections 
subject to specific agreement between the material purchaser 
and the manufacturer.
