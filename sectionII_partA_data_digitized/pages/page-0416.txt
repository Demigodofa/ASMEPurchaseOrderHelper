SA-249 /SA-249M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
. ~e following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the 
mqmry, contract, or order. 
Sl. Stress-Relieved Annealed Tubes 
S 1.1 For use in certain corrosives, particularly chlorides 
where stres~ corrosion may occur, tubes in Grades TP304L, 
TP316L, TP321, TP347, and TP348 may be specified in the 
stress-relieved annealed condition. Details of these supplemen­
tal requirements shall be agreed upon by the manufacturer and 
the purchaser. 
S 1.2 When stress-relieved tubes are specified, tubes shall be 
given a heat treatment at 1550 to 1650 °F [845 to 900 °C] after 
roll straightening. Cooling from this temperature range may be 
either in air or by slow cooling. No mechanical straightening is 
permitted after the stress-relief treatment. 
S 1.3 Straightness of the tubes shall be a matter of negotiation 
between the purchaser and manufacturer. 
S2. Minimum Wall Tubes 
S2.1 When specified by the purchaser, tubes shall be fur­
nished on a minimum wall basis. Such tubes shall satisfy the 
minimum wall thickness requirements of Specification A1016/ 
Al016M rather than the nominal wall requirements of this 
specification. In ~ddition to the marking required by Section 
18, the tubing shall be marked S2. 
S3. Pneumatic Test 
S3.1 The tubing shall be examined by a pneumatic test 
(either air under water or pneumatic leak test) in accordance 
with Specification A1016/Al016M. 
S4. Stabilizing Heat Treatment 
S4.1 Subsequent to the solution anneal required in Section 
6, Grades TP309HCb, TP310HCb, TP321, TP321H, TP347, 
TP347H, TP348, and TP348H shall be given a stabilization 
heat treatment at a temperature lower than that used for the 
initial solution annealing heat treatment. The temperature of 
stabilization heat treatment shall be at a temperature as agreed 
upon between the purchaser and vendor. 
SS. DELETED 
S6. Intergranular Corrosion Test 
S6.l When specified, material shall pass intergranular cor­
rosion tests conducted by the manufacturer in accordance with 
Practices A262, Practice E. 
NoTE S6.1-Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condition for 
low carbon or stabilized grades, and on the as-shipped condition for other 
grades. 
S6.2 A stabilization heat treatment in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement S4 may be necessary and is 
permitted in order to meet this requirement for the grades 
containing titanium or columbium, particularly in their H 
versions.

87. Weld Decay Test 
S7.1 This test is not applicable to alloys with a nickel 
content 2:: 19.0 % or a molybdenum content 2:: 4.00 %, or both. 
Norn S7.1-Toe weld decay test is sensitive for the presence of delta 
ferrite in the weld material. Increasing amounts of delta ferrite will result 
in a higher ratio as defined in S7 .10. Alloys with the high nickel or 
molybdenum content of S7 .1 may not form delta fenite and therefore may 
not be sensitive to this test. 
S7.2 When specified by the purchase order, one sample 
from each lot of tubing (See 13.9.2) shall be subjected to 
testing in a boiling mixture of 50 % reagent grade hydrochloric 
acid and 50 % water. 
S7 .3 Approximately 2-in. long samples shall be prepared 
from a production length of tubing. Shorter, 1-in. samples may 
be used for small diameter (½-in. and below) tubing. Split the 
sample longitudinally to allow for easy micrometer measure­
ments. The sample may be one piece which contains the weld 
and at least 90° of base-metal to one side of the weld. 
Alternately, the sample may be two separate pieces with one 
containing the weld and a similar size section from the balance 
of the tube opposite the weld consisting of 100 % base metal. 
Remove all burrs and sharp edges by lightly grinding. Remove 
dust and grease by cleaning with soap and water or other 
suitable solvents. Then, place sample(s) in the flask. It is not 
recommended to test more than four samples together, or to 
mix alloy types. 
S7.4 Prepare the hydrochloric acid solution by slowly add­
ing reagent grade (approximately 37 %) hydrochloric acid to 
an equal volume of distilled water. (Warning-Protect eyes 
and use rubber gloves when handling acid. Mixing shall be 
done under a hood and testing shall be run under a hood.) 
S7.5 The test container shall be a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask 
equipped with ground-glass joints and an Ahlin condenser. The 
volume of the solution shall be approximately 700 mL. 
S7 .6 Measure the thickness of the tube at five locations 
along the weld area and at five locations along the base-metal 
section. In both cases, take measurements at approximately 
equal longitudinal intervals along the section lengths. Make 
these measurements with a sharp pointed micrometer accurate 
to at least 0.001 in. The micrometer must be suitable for 
measuring the small features in the surface after testing. 
Typical pin micrometers have tapered anvils with a tip radius 
of less than 0.015 in. 
S7.7 Immerse the samples into the solution. Add boiling 
chips and bring to a boil. Allow the chips to remain boiling 
throughout the test. The time of testing shall be that which is 
required to remove 40 to 60 % of the original base-metal
