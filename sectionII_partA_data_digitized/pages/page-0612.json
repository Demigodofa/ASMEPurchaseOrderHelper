When equipment of sufficient capac\u00ad\nity for full-size testing is not available, or when the length of \nthe fastener makes full-size testing impractical, machined \nspecimens shall be tested and shall conform to the require\u00ad\nments in accordance with Table 4. In the event that fasteners \nare tested by both full-size and by the machined test specimen \nmethods, the full-size test shall govern if a controversy \nbetween the two methods exists. \n6.4 For fasteners on which both hardness and tension tests \nare performed, acceptance based on tensile requirements shall \ntake precedence in the event that there is controversy over low \nreadings of hardness tests. \n7. Dimensions \n7.1 Bolts-Unless otherwise specified, the bolts shall be \nHex Head with dimensions conforming to the latest issue of \nASME Bl8.2.l. \n560 \n7 .2 Studs-Studs shall have dimensions conforming to those \nspecified by the purchaser. \n7.3 Threads: \n7.3.1 Unless otherwise specified, threads shall be the Uni\u00ad\nfied National Coarse Thread Series as specified in Bl.I, and \nshall have Class 2 A tolerances. \n7.3.2 When specified, threads shall be the Unified National \nFine Thread Series, 8-Pitch Thread Series for sizes over 1 in. or \n14-Pitch UNS on 1 in. size as specified in ANSI B 1.1 and shall \nhave Class 2A tolerances. \n7.3.3 Unless otherwise specified, bolts and studs to be used \nwith nuts or tapped holes that have been tapped oversize, in \naccordance with Specification A563, shall have Class 2A \nthreads before hot dip or mechanically deposited zinc coating. \nAfter zinc coating, the maximum limit of pitch and major \ndiameter may exceed the Class 2A limit by the following \namount: \n\u00bc \n5/rn, 3/s \n7 /16, \u00bd \nDiameter, in. \n9/16 to \u00be, incl \n7/a \n1.0 to 1\u00bc, incl \n1%, 1\u00bd \n1\u00be to 4.0, incl \nOversize Limit, in.

Workmanship \n8.1 Surface discontinuity limits shall be in accordance with \nSpecification F788/F788M. \n9. Number of Tests \n9.1 Testing Responsibility: \n9.1.1 Each lot shall be tested by the manufacturer prior to \nshipment in accordance with the lot identification control \nquality assurance plan in 9.2 through 9.6. \n9.1.2 When fasteners are furnished by a source other than \nthe manufacturer, the responsible party as defined in 12.1 shall \nbe responsible for ensuring that all tests have been performed \nand the fasteners comply with the requirements of this speci\u00ad\nfication. \n9.2 Purpose of Lot Inspection-The purpose of a lot inspec\u00ad\ntion program is to ensure that each lot conforms to the \nrequirements of this specification.
