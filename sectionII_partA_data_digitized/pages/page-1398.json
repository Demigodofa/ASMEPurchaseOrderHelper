For purposes of tensile, yield and elongation \nrequirements listed in Table 3, the tensile specimen shall \nconsist of base metal only. If the purchaser requires results, \ninvolving the weld, in addition to the base metal only results, \nthen the S2 supplemental requirement of this specification shall \nbe specified on the purchase order. When S2 is specified, the \nweld metal must meet only the minimum ultimate tensile \nstrength of Table 3. \n9. Hardness Requirements \n9.1 Fittings shall not exceed the maximum hardness shown \nin Table 3. \n10. Dimensions \n10.1 The sizes, shapes, and dimensions of the fittings \ncovered by ASME Bl6.9, ASME B16.ll, MSS SP-43, MSS \nSP-79, MSS SP-83, MSS SP-95, or MSS SP-97 shall be as \nspecified in those standards. \n10.2 Fittings of size or shape differing from these standards, \nbut meeting all other requirements of this specification, may be \nfurnished in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S58 \nof Specification A960/A960M. \n11. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n11.1 Fittings supplied under this specification shall be \nexamined visually. Selected typical surface discontinuities \nshall be explored for depth. The fittings shall be free from \nsmface discontinuities that penetrate more than 5 % of the \nspecified nominal wall thickness, except as defined in 11.3 and \n11 .4, and shall have a workmanlike finish. \n11.2 Surface discontinuities deeper than 5 % of the specified \nnominal wall thickness, except as defined in 11.3 and 11.4, \nshall be removed by the manufacturer by machining or \ngrinding to sound metal, and the repaired areas shall be well \nfaired. The waJl thiclmess at all points shall be at least 87\u00bd % \nof the specified nominal wall thickness, and the diameters at all \npoints shall be within the specified limits. \n11.3 Surface checks (fish scale) deeper than 1/64 in. [0.4 mm] \nshall be removed. \n11.4 Mechanical marks deeper than 1/16 in. (1.6 mm] shall be \nrernoved. \n1 LS When the removal of a surface discontinuity reduces \nthe wall thickness below 87\u00bd % of the specified nominal wall \nthickness at any point, the fitting shall be subject to rejection or \nto repair as provided in 11.6. \n11.6 Repair by Welding: \n11.6.1 Repair welding, of the base metal by the manufac\u00ad\nturer, is pem1issible for fittings made to the dimensional \nstandards listed in HU or for other standard fittings made for \nstock. Prior approval of the purchaser is required to repair \nspecial fittings made to the purchaser's requirements. Repair \nby welding shall neither exceed 10 % of the outside surface \narea of the fitting nor 33 1/2 % of the nominal wall thickness. \n11.6.2 The welding procedure and welders shall be qualified \nin accordance with Specification A960/A960M. \n11.6.3 The alloy content (carbon, chromium, nickel, molyb\u00ad\ndenum, columbium, and titanium) of the deposited weld metal \nshall be within the same percentage range as permitted for the \nbase metal. (Warning-When selecting the filler metal and \nwelding procedure, consideration should be given to their \neffect on corrosion resistance in service.) \n11.6.4 Surface discontinuities deeper than 5 % of the speci\u00ad\nfied nominal wall thickness shall be removed by mechanical \nmeans or thermal cutting or gouging methods. Cavities pre\u00ad\npared for welding shall be examined by the liquid penetrant \nmethod of Practice E165. No cracks shall be permitted in the \nprepared cavities. \n11.6.5 The weld repair shall be permanently identified with \nthe welder's stamp or symbol in accordance with Specification \nA960/ A960M. \n11.6.6 Weld repair area(s) shall be blended uniformly to the \nbase metal and shall be examined by liquid penetrant in \naccordance with Practice El65. No cracks shall be permitted in \nthe weld or surrounding \u00bd in. [13 mm] of base metal. \n11.6.7 After weld repair, material shall be heat treated in \naccordance with Section 6. \n11.7 The fittings shall be cleaned free of scale. \n1336 ",
