INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless and Welded Ferritic/Austenitic Stainless Steel 
Tubing for General Service 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A 789/A 789M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1. 1 This specification 2 covers grades of average wall 
thickness, or, if specified on the order, minimum wall 
thickness, of stainless steel tubing for services requiring 
general corrosion resistance, with particular emphasis on 
resistance to stress corrosion cracking. These steels are suscep­
tible to embrittlement if used for prolonged periods at elevated 
temperatures. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. Within the text, the SI units are shown in 
brackets. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the M 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.3 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
