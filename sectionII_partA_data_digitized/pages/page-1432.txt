test specimens as specified by the purchaser in accordance with 
6.3. However, since the drop-weight specimen can be taken in 
any orientation, the fracture plane of the specimen when tested 
to Method 2 (see 6.3.2) shall be a minimum distance of 7/16 in. 
[10 mm] from the nearest quenched surface, and 1 V2 in. 
[40 mm] from any second surface. The purchaser may specify 
either duplicate no-break performance when tested 10 °F 
[5 °C] warmer than a specified temperature or request a 
determination of the Nil-Ductility temperature. 
S8. Rings and Hollow Cylindrically-Shaped Parts 
SS.l Tests shall be removed in the tangential (circumferen­
tial) direction regardless of the direction of maximum working. 
S9. Alternative Test Specimen Orientation 
S9.1 The longitudinal axis of all test specimens shall be 
oriented in a direction transverse to the direction of maximum 
working of the forging. 
SlO. Dynamic Tear Test 
S 10.1 For Grade B material, dynamic tear testing shall be 
carried out in accordance with Test Method E604. Unless 
otherwise specified by the purchaser the test temperature shall 
be -20 ± 3 °F [-30 ± 2 °C]. Acceptance criteria shall be in
