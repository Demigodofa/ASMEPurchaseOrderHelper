Except for all \ntypes of flanges, elbows, return bends, tees, and header \ntees, other parts up to and including NPS 4 may be \nmachined from hot-rolled or forged bar. \n4.5 When specified in the order, the manufacturer shall \nsubmit for purchaser's approval a sketch showing the shape \nof the rough forging before machining. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements of \nTable 1. \n5.2 If required by the purchaser, product analysis may \nbe performed in accordance with the requirements of \nA 961. \n6. Heat Treatment \n6.1 The forgings shall be heat treated by the manufac\u00ad\nturer by either of the following methods as mutually agreed \nupon between the purchaser and the manufacturer. \n6.1.1 Quenched and Tempered - Heat to a uniform \ntemperature of 1475 \u00b1 25\u00b0F [800 \u00b1 15\u00b0C]; hold at this \ntemperature for a minimum time of 1 h/in.

Reheat until the forging \nattains a uniform temperature within the range from 1050 \nto l 125\u00b0F [565 to 605\u00b0C]; hold at this temperature for a \nminimum time of 1 h/in. [2.5 min/mm] of thickness but \nminimum rate of 300\u00b0F [165\u00b0C]/h to a temperature not \nexceeding 600\u00b0F [3 l 5\u00b0C]. \n7. Mechanical Properties \n7.1 Tension Test - Forgings to Types 1 and 2 shall \nconform to the tensile requirements of Table 2. \n7 .2 Impact Test - The Charpy impact test requirements \nin Table 3 shall be met unless Supplementary Requirement \nS2 of this specification has been specified. \n7.2.1 The values for energy absorption and the frac\u00ad\nture appearance in percentage of shear fracture for each \nspecimen shall be recorded and reported for information. \n8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n8.1 The forgings shall have a workman-like finish and \nshall be free of injurious defects. \n9. Number of Tests and Retests \n9.1 At least one tension test and one set of Charpy \nV-notch impact tests shall be made from each heat in each \nheat-treatment charge. \n9.2 If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform \nto the specified requirements, the manufacturer may retreat \nthe forgings, but not more than three additional times. \nRetreatment involves re-austenitizing the forgings. Retests \nshall be made in accordance with this section. \nin no case less than 30 min; cool in air or water quench, 9.3 If the lateral expansion result from one Charpy \nat a rate not less than 300\u00b0F [165\u00b0C]/h. impact specimen falls below 0.015 in.

[25 mm]. \nFor thicknesses over I in. [25 mm], a minimum additional \nholding time in the ratio of 1 h/in. [2.5 min/mm] of thick\u00ad\nness in excess of I in. [25 mm] shall be added. Cool at a \n881 \n10. Test Specimens \n10.1 The test specimens shall be located at any point \nmidway between the center and surface of solid forgings, \nand at any point mid-thickness of the heaviest section of \nhollow or bored forgings. For solid forgings where test \nmetal is provided on the periphery, test specimens shall \nbe taken at mid-thickness of the test prolongation. \n10.2 Tests shall be oriented so that the longitudinal \naxis of the specimen is parallel to the major direction of \ngrain flow. \n10.3 When fabrication requires stress relieving, the \npurchaser shall specify stress relieving of the test pieces \nprior to machining of the test specimens. Stress relieving \nshall be carried out as prescribed in 6.2. ",
