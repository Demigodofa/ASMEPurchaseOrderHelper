(5 mm) and the powder shall be produced by the gas \natomization process. \nImmediately following atomization, the powder shall remain shielded by an inert gas until the powder is \nbelow a temperature of 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C), to ensure that the detrimental absorption ofoxygen and other \ndeleterious contaminants is no longer possible. \nFor austenitic stainless steels, duplex stainless steels, martensitic stainless steels, and nickel alloys, powder \nshould be protected during storage to prevent the detrimental pickup of oxygen and other contaminants. \nFor ferritic steels, following atomization, powders shall be stored under a positive nitrogen or argon \natmosphere or vacuum to minimize potential oxidation or contamination. \nMandatory testing of hot isostatically The chemical composition of a sample from one part from each lot of parts shall be determined by the \npressed components manufacturer. The composition of the sample shall conform to the chemistry requirements of the defined . \nwrought product form. \nThe microstructure shall be examined at 20-S0X, 100-Z00X, and 1,000-2,000X. The microstructure shall be \nreasonably uniform and shall be free of voids, laps, cracks, and porosity. One sample from each production \nlot shall be examined. The sample shall be taken from the component, stem, protrusion, or test part made \nfrom a sirigle powder blend consolidated in the same hot isostatic press, using the same pressure, \ntemperature, and time parameters, and heat treated in the same final heat-treatment charge at the option \nof the producer, after hot isostatic pressing or after final heat treatment. \nSamples for mechanical testing shall be from the component,stem, protrusion, or test part made from a single \npowder blend consolidated in the same hot isostatic press, using the same pressure, temperature, and time \nparameters, and heat-treated in the same final heat-treatment charge. \nMaterial certification requirements A manufacturer's certification shall be furnished to the purchaser stating that material has been \nGENERAL NOTES: \nmanufactured, tested, and inspected in accordance with the applicable specification, and that the test \nresults on representative samples meet specification requirements. A report of the test results shall be \nfurnished. \n(a) When a grade does exist in a defined wrought product form for alloys other than those cited, an inquirer may request the inclusion of \nhot isostatically pressed (HIP) components of this grade. However, the Committee may have additional requirements placed on the \ngrade to accept this request. \n(b) If the material is to be used at temperatures where the time-dependent performance will determine the allowable stress values, the \nrequirements \u00b7of Mandatory Appendix IV relative to the provision of data for new materials shall apply. \n1626 ",
