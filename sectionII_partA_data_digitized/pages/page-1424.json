THERMO-MECHANICAL CONTROLLED PROCESSING (TMCP) \nXl.1 Introduction-The Thermo\u2022Mechanical Controlled \nProcessing, commonly referred . to as \"TMCP,\" has evolved \nfrom the \"controlled rolling\" (CR) processes, which have been \nknown and used for a number of years. TMCP produces \nfine-grained steel by a combination of chemical composition \nand integrated controls of manufacturing processes from slab \nreheating to post-rolling cooling, thereby achieving the speci\u00ad\nfied mechanical properties in the required plate thicknesses. \nTMCP requires accurate control of both the steel temperature \nand rolling reductions, and does not involve coiling after the \npost- cooling. \nXl.2 Outline of TMCP As May Be applied to Grades A \nthrough F-As shown in Fig. Xl.l, TMCP for those grades \nmay incorporate three processes, as follows: \nXl.2.1 Thermo-Mechanical Rolling (TMR)-Steels of fine \ngrain size are produced by rolling in the recrystallization and \nthe nonrecrystallization regions of austenite, and sometimes in \nthe dual-phase temperature region of austenite and ferrite. \nGenerally, a high proportion of the rolling reduction is per\u2022 \nlYPE OF PROCESSING \nSTRUCTURE .

Subsequent to direct quenching the plates are \ntempered. \nXl.2.4 The selection, from the above, of the method to be \nused is made by the plate producer depending upon the \nchemical composition, the plate thickness, and the required \nproperties. \nCONVENTIONAL PRO<l!SSES \nOQ\u00b7T AA N CR \n(8) (9) (10) (11) (12) \nR \nAIJffl!lm! \n+l'!!!IRm! \nAr1 \nAC AC AC \nl'lilllUTe+l'l!:'AA1ffll \n(l'l!llRm + SAIHfl'll \n+l!AA1ffiSITI!) \nNelie: \n'TMR: TH~l ROI.UNG N: NORMAIRS> \nM;: ACCEt.ellATeO COOUNG PEtOa!SS ~: CONTROi.i.ED ROI.UNG \nAR: AS ROWD R: REDUCTION \nDQ: tl!RllCT QUl!NO!lNG \nT:TeMPEREO \nFIG, X1 .1 Schematic Diagrams of Thermo-Mechanical Control and Conventional Process of Steel Plate as may be Applied to Grades A \nthrough F \n1362 ",
