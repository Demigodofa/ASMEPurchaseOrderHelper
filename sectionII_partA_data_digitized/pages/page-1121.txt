ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-587 
9.3 The reverse flattening test specified in 6.3 shall be made 
on 1 length of pipe from each lot of 250 lengths or fraction 
thereof. 
9.4 The flange test as specified in 6.4 shall be made on 
specimens from 2 lengths of pipe from each lot of 250 lengths 
or fraction thereof. 
10. Retests 
10.1 If the results of the mechanical tests of any heat or lot 
do not conform to the requirements specified, retests may be 
made on additional pipe of double the original number from the 
same heat or lot, each of which shall conform to the require­
ments specified. 
11. Retreatment 
11.1 If a heat or lot fails to conform to the test requirements, 
that heat or lot may be reheat treated and resubmitted for tests. 
Not more than one reheat treatment shall be permitted. 
12. Test Specimens and Methods of Testing 
12.1 The test specimens and the tests required by this 
specification shall conform to those described in Test Methods 
and Definitions A370. 
12.2 Test specimens shall be taken from the ends of finished 
pipe prior to upsetting, swaging, expanding, or other forming 
operations, or being cut to length. They shall be smooth on the 
ends and free from burrs and flaws. 
12.3 If any test specimen shows flaws or defective machin­
ing, it may be discarded and another specimen substituted. 
13. Nondestructive Test 
13.1 The nondestructive test shall be made instead of the 
hydrostatic test. 
13.1.1 The test shall provide a 360° inspection for sizes up 
to and including 3½ in. (88.9 mm) outside diameter. 
13.1.2 For pipe larger than 3½ in. (88.9 mm) outside 
diameter, nondestructive inspection of the weld and heat 
affected zone is required. 
13.2 Each pipe shall be tested with a nondestructive test in 
accordance with Practices E213, E273, E309, or E570. Except 
as provided in 13.6.2, it is the intent of this test to reject pipe 
with imperfections that produce test signals equal to or greater 
than that of the calibration standard. In order to accommodate 
the various types of nondestructive testing equipment and 
techniques in use, and manufacturing practices employed, any 
one of the following calibration standards may be used, at the 
option of the producer, to establish a minimum sensitivity level 
for rejection: 
13.3 For eddy-current testing, the calibration pipe shall 
contain, at the option of the producer, any one of the following 
discontinuities to establish a minimum sensitivity level for 
rejection. For welded pipe, they shall be placed in the weld if 
visible. 
13.3.1 Drilled Hole-A hole not larger than 0.031 in. (0.79 
mm) in diameter shall be drilled radially and completely 
through the pipe wall, taking care to avoid distortion of the 
pipe while drilling. 
13.3.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool or 
file with a ¼-in. 6.4 mm diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe, preferably in the weld area. Said notch 
shall have a depth not exceeding 12½ % of the specified wall 
thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. (0.10 mm), whichever is 
greater. 
13.3.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. (0.79 mm) or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
pipe axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to a depth not 
exceeding 121/2 % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.004 in. (0.102 mm), whichever is greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
13.4 For ultrasonic testing, the longitudinal calibration ref­
erence notches shall be at the option of the producer, any one 
of the three common notch shapes shown in Practices E213 or 
E273. The depth of the notch shall not exceed 12½ % of the 
specified wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. (0.102 mm), 
whichever is greater. For welded pipe, the notch shall be placed 
in the weld, if visible. 
13.5 For flux leakage testing, each of the longitudinal 
calibration notches shall be a straight-sided notch not over 12½ 
% of the wall thickness in depth and not over 1.0 in. (25 mm) 
in length. Both outside diameter and inside diameter notches 
shall be placed in the tube located sufficiently apart to enable 
separation and identification of the signals. 
13.6 Pipe producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
calibration defect shall be subject to rejection. The area 
producing the signal may be examined. 
13.6.1 Test signals produced by imperfections that cannot 
be identified, or produced by cracks or crack-like defects shall 
result in rejection of the pipe subject to rework and retest. 
13.6.2 Test signals produced by imperfections such as those 
listed below may be judged as injurious or noninjurious 
depending on visual observation or their severity or the type of 
signal they produce on the testing equipment used, or both: 
13.6.2.1 Dinges, 
13.6.2.2 Straightener marks, 
13.6.2.3 Loose inside diameter bead and cutting chips, 
13.6.2.4 Scratches, 
13.6.2.5 Steel die stamps, 
13.6.2.6 Chattered flash him, 
13.6.2.7 Stop marks, or 
13.6.2.8 Tube reducer ripple. 
13.6.3 Any imperfection of the above type exceeding 
0.004 in. (0.102 mm) or 12½ % of the specified wall thickness 
(whichever is greater) in depth shall be considered injurious. 
13.6.3.1 If the imperfection is judged as injurious, the pipe 
shall be rejected but may be reconditioned and retested 
providing the dimensional requirements are met. 
13.6.3.2 If the imperfection is explored to the extent that it 
can be identified as noninjurious, the pipe may be accepted 
without further test providing the imperfection does not en­
croach on the minimum wall thickness. 
14. Inspection 
14.1 The inspector shall have entry at all times while work 
on an order is being done to all parts of the manufacturer's
