Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Melting Process - The steel shall be made by open\u00ad\nhearth or electric furnace process with or without separate \nrefining, such as argon-oxygen-decarburization (AOD), \nunless otherwise specified in the individual specification. \n4.2 Heat Treatment: \n4.2.1 Castings shall be heat treated in the working \nzone of a furnace that has been surveyed in accordance \nwith Test Method A 991 / A 991M. \n4.2.2 When castings are heat treated at temperatures \nabove 2000\u00b0F [1100\u00b0C], then the working zone shall have \nbeen established by a survey performed at not more than \n25\u00b0F [15\u00b0C] below nor more than 200\u00b0F [l 10\u00b0C] above \nthe minimum heat treatment temperature specified for the \ngrade. If a minimum heat treatment temperature is not \nspecified for the grade, then the survey temperature shall \nbe not more than 50\u00b0F [30\u00b0C] below nor more than 175\u00b0F \n[ 100\u00b0C] above the furnace set point used. \n4.2.3 The maximum variation in measured tempera\u00ad\nture as determined by the difference between the highest \ntemperature and the lowest temperature shall be as agreed \nbetween the purchaser and producer except that during \nproduction heat treatment, no portion of the furnace shall \nbe below the minimum specified temperature nor above \nthe maximum specified temperature for the grade being \nprocessed. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 Chemical Analysis - Chemical analysis of materi\u00ad\nals covered by this specification shall be in accordance \nwith Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A 751. \n5.2 Heat Analysis - An analysis of each heat shall be \nmade by the manufacturer to determine the percentages of \n1253 ",
