(100 mm) long \nand consists of having a flange turned over at right angles to the \nbody of the tube to the width required by the applicable \nmaterial specifications. The flaring tool and die block shown in \nFig. A2.11 are recommended for use in making this test. \nA2.5. I.5 Flaring Test-For certain types of pressure tubes, \nan alternate to the flange test is made. This test consists of \ndriving a tapered mandrel having a slope of 1 in 10 as shown \nin Fig. A2.12 (a) or a 60\u00b0 included angle as shown in Fig. \nA2.12 (b) into a section cut from the tube, approximately 4 in. \n(100 mm) in length, and thus expanding the specimen until the \ninside diameter has been increased to the extent required by the \napplicable material specifications. \nA2.5.l.6 Bend Test-For pipe used for coiling in sizes 2 in. \nand under a bend test is made to determine its ductility and the \nsoundness of weld. In this test a sufficient length of full-size \npipe is bent cold through 90\u00b0 around a cylindrical mandrel \nhaving a diameter 12 times the nominal diameter of the pipe. \nFor close coiling, the pipe is bent cold through 180\u00b0 around a \nmandrel having a diameter 8 times the nominal diameter of the \npipe. \nt \nA B C \n-1 \n~t.1\u00b7 \nll 4 4 \nA = Outs.

The \nspecimens used are approximately 1 \u00bd in. (38 mm) wide, at \nleast 6 in. (152 mm) in length with the weld at the center, and \nare machined in accordance with Fig. A2.13 for face and root \nbend tests and in accordance with Fig. A2. l 4 for side bend \ntests. The dimensions of the plunger shall be as shown in Fig. \nA2.15 and the other dimensions of the bending jig shall be \nsubstantially as given in this same figure. A test shall consist of \na face bend specimen and a root bend specimen or two side \nbend specimens. A face bend test requires bending with the \ninside surface of the pipe against the plunger; a root bend test \nrequires bending with the outside surface of the pipe against \nthe plunger; and a side bend test requires bending so that one \nof the side smfaces becomes the convex surface of the bend \nspecimen. \n( 1) Failure of the bend test depends upon the appearance of \ncracks in the area of the bend, of the nature and extent \ndescribed in the product specifications. \nA \"\u00b0 Outs.
