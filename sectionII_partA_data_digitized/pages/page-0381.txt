3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions-For definitions of terms used in this speci­
fication refer to Specification A960/A960M. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 See Specification A960/ A960M. 
5. General Requirements 
5.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A960/ A960M, including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase 
order. Failure to comply with the requirements of Specification 
A960/A960M constitutes non-conformance with this specifi­
cation. In case of a conflict between the requirements of this 
specification and Specification A960/ A960M, this specification 
shall prevail. 
6. Materials 
6.1 The starting material for fittings shall be killed steel, 
consisting of forgings, bars, plates, sheet, and seamless or 
fusion-welded tubular products with filler metal added and 
shall conform to the chemical requirements of Table 1. Unless 
otherwise specified for carbon steel plates and sheet, the steel 
may be made to either coarse grain or fine grain practice. Grade 
WP9 shall be made to fine grain practice. 
6.2 A starting material specification that specifically re­
quires the addition of any element beyond those listed for the 
materials in Table 1 for the applicable grade of material is not 
permitted. This does not preclude the use of deoxidizers or the 
judicious use of elements for grain size control. 
7. Manufacture 
7 .1 Forging or shaping operations may be performed by 
hammering, pressing, piercing, extruding, upsetting, rolling,

bending, fusion welding, machining, or by a combination of 
two or more of these operations. The forming procedure shall 
be so applied that it will not produce injurious imperfections in 
the fittings. 
7 .2 Fittings NPS-4 and under may be machined from 
hot-forged or rolled, cold-sized, and straightened bar stock 
having the chemical composition of the Grade in Table 1 and 
the mechanical properties of the Grade in Table 2. Heat 
treatment shall be in accordance with Section 8. All caps 
machined from bar stock shall be examined by liquid penetrant 
or magnetic particle in accordance with S52 or S53 in 
Specification A960/A960M. 
7.3 All welds including welds in tubular products from 
which fittings are made shall be (1) made by welders, welding 
operators, and welding procedures qualified under the provi­
sions of ASME Section IX, (2) heat treated in accordance with 
Section 8 of this specification, and (3) radiographically exam­
ined throughout the entire length of each weld in accordance 
with Article 2, ASME Section V with acceptance limits in 
accordance with Paragraph UW-51 of ASME Section VIIl, 
Division 1 of the ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code. In 
place of radiographic examination, welds may be ultrasonically 
examined in accordance with Appendix 12 of Section VIIl. The 
NDE of welds in Grades WPB, WPC, WPl, WPll Class 1, 
WPll Class 2, WPll Class 3, WP12 Class 1, WP12 Class 2, 
and WPR may be performed either prior to or after forming. 
NDE of welds in Grades WPS, WP9, WP91 Types 1 and 2, 
WP911, WP92, WP22 Class 1, WP22 Class 3, and WP24 shall 
be done after forming. 
7.3.1 All welds in WP91 Types 1 and 2 shall be made with 
one of the following welding processes and consumables: 
SMAW, A5.5/A5.5M E90:XX-B9; SAW, A5.23/A5.23M EB9 + 
flux; GTAW, A5.28/A5.28M ER90S-B9; and FCAW AS.29/ 
A5.29M E91Tl-B9. In addition, the Ni+Mn content of all 
welding consumables used to fabricate WP91 Type 1 and Type 
2 fittings shall not exceed 1.0 %. 
7.3.2 All welds in WP92 and WP911 shall be made using 
welding consumables meeting the chemical requirements for 
the grade in Table 1. 
329 
7.3.3 All welds in WP115 shall be made using deposited 
filler metal suitable for the composition being welded. Any 
defects shall be thoroughly chipped or ground out before 
welding and each welded length shall be re-heat treated or 
stress relieved as required by the application specification. 
Alternately, the weld shall be made with the welding products 
and procedures of 7 .3 .1. 
7.4 Personnel performing NDE examinations shall be quali­
fied in accordance with SNT-TC- lA. 
7 .5 The welded joints of the fittings shall be finished in 
accordance with the requirements of Paragraph UW-35 (a) of 
ASME Section Vlll, Division 1. 
7.6 All butt-weld tees manufactured by cold-forming meth­
od(s) shall be liquid penetrant or magnetic particle examined 
by one of the methods specified in Supplementary Requirement 
S52 or S53 in Specification A960/A960M. This examination 
shall be performed after final heat treat. Only the side wall area 
of the tees need be examined. This area is defined by a circle
