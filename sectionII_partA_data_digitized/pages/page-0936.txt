SA-508/SA-S0BM ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Quenched and Tempered Vacuum-Treated Carbon and Alloy 
Steel Forgings for Pressure Vessels 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers quenched and tempered 
vacuum-treated carbon and alloy steel forgings for pressure 
vessels such as those used in reactor systems. Specifically, it 
covers forgings for vessel closures, shells, flanges, tube sheets, 
rings, heads, and similar parts. 
1.2 All grades are considered weldable under proper condi­
tions. Welding technique is of fundamental importance, and it 
is presupposed that welding procedure and inspection will be in 
accordance with approved. methods for the grade of material 
used. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.4 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch­
pound units. 
Norn I-Grades 1 and lA are composed of different chemistries but 
have the same mechanical requirements.

1.5 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with _its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
