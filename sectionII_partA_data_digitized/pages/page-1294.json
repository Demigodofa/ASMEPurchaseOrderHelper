Scope \n1.1 This specification covers the general requirements \nfor hot-rolled steel strip in coils and cut lengths. It applies \nto carbon steel and high-strength, low-alloy steel furnished \nas hot-rolled. \n1.2 This specification is not applicable to hot-rolled \nheavy-thickness carbon sheet and strip coils (ASTM Speci\u00ad\nfication A 635 / A 635M), cold-rolled carbon steel strip \n(ASTM Specification A 109 or A 109M), high-strength, \nlow-alloy coldrolled steel (ASTM Specifications A 606 and \nA 607) or cold-rolled carbon spring steel (ASTM Specifi\u00ad\ncation A 682 or A 682M). \n1.3 In case of any conflict in requirements, the require\u00ad\nments of the individual material specification shall prevail \nover those of this general specification. \n1.4 For the purposes of determining conformance with \nthis and the appropriate product specification referenced \nunder 2.1, values shall be rounded to the nearest unit in \nthe right hand place of figures used in expressing the lim\u00ad\niting values in accordance with the rounding method of \nPractice E 29. \n1.5 Annex Al lists permissible variations in dimensions \nand mass (Note 1) in S.I. [metric] units. The values listed \nare not exact conversions of the values listed in the inch\u00ad\npound tables, but instead are rounded or rationalized val\u00ad\nues. Conformance to Annex Al is mandatory when the \n\"M\" specification is used. \nNOTE 1 - The tenn \"weight\" is used when inch-pound units are the \nstandard; however, under S.I., the preferred tennis \"mass.\" \n1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \nunits are to be regarded as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nmust be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in nonconformance with \nthe specification. \n1.7 This specification and the applicable material speci\u00ad\nfications are expressed in both inch-pound units and SI \nunits. However, unless the order specifies the applicable \n\"M\" specification designation (SI units), the material shall \nbe furnished to inch-pound units. \n2.
