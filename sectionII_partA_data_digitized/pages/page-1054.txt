SA-563 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR CARBON AND ALLOY 
STEEL NUTS 
SA-563 
[Identical with ASTM Specification A 563-07a(2014) except for deletion of the term "private label distributor" in para. 14.7 and 14.9 and 
editorially correct title.] 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers chemical and mechanical 
requirements for eight grades of carbon and alloy steel 
nuts for general structural and mechanical uses on bolts, 
studs, and other externally threaded parts. 
NOTE 1 - See Appendix Xl for guidance on suitable application of 
nut grades. 
1.2 The requirements for any grade of nut may, at the 
supplier's option, and with notice to the purchaser, be 
fulfilled by furnishing nuts of one of the stronger grades 
specified herein unless such substitution is barred in the 
inquiry and purchase order. 
1.3 Grades C3 and DH3 nuts have atmospheric corro­
sion resistance and weathering characteristics comparable 
to that of the steels covered in Specifications 
A 242/ A 242M, A 588/ A 588M, and A 709 / A 709M. The 
atmospheric corrosion resistance of these steels is substan­
tially better than that of carbon steel with or without copper 
addition (see 5.2). When properly exposed to the atmo­
sphere, these steels can be used bare (uncoated) for many 
applications. 
NOTE 2 - A complete metric compan.ion to Specification A 563 has 
_ -bet\n. dev€\lo13ed-A 563M; therefore, no metric equIValenfs are presentea 
in this specification. 
1.4 Terms used in this specification are defined in Ter­
minology F 1789 unless otherwise defined herein.
