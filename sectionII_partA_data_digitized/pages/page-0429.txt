edges parallel. In reducing the thickness of the specimen, both 
the alloy cladding and the base steel shall be machined so as to 
maintain the same ratio of clad metal to base steel as is 
maintained in the plate, except that the thickness of the clad 
metal need not be reduced below Vs in. (3.1 mm). The sides of 
the bend test specimen used for bond strength determination 
may have the corners rounded to a radius not over V16 in. (1.6 
mm) for plates, 2 in. (50 mm) and under in thickness, and not 
over Vs in. (3.1 mm) for plates over 2 in. (50 mm) in thickness. 
10. Product Analysis 
10.1 Product analysis may be required for the cladding alloy 
on the finished product. Chemical analysis may be accom­
plished by wet chemical or instrumental procedures. If wet 
chemical procedures are used, millings may be taken only 
when the composite plate thickness is sufficient to permit 
obtaining millings without danger of contamination from the 
adjacent layer. If spectrometric procedures are used, the sample 
shall be exposed on the center line of the cladding when there 
is sufficient cladding thickness available so that there is no 
contamination from the adjacent base metal. 
10.2 If product analysis is specified by the purchaser for the 
cladding alloy, it shall be made from drillings or millings taken 
from the final piece or a broken test specimen. For wet 
chemical analysis, in order to avoid contamination by the base 
plate metal, millings of cladding samples shall be taken from 
the test coupon by removal and discard of all the base metal 
plate material, plus 40 % of the cladding thickness from the 
bonded side, not to exceed V16 in. (1.6 mm). The material shall 
be chemically cleaned and sufficient millings shall be taken to 
represent the full cross-section of the remainder. If there is 
insufficient cladding thickness available to spectrographically 
expose on the center line of the cladding without 
contamination, 50 % of the cladding shall be removed and the 
sample exposed on this surface. 
10.3 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with the 
Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology of A751. 
10.4 Results of the product analysis shall conform to the 
requirements of Section 7 of Specification A480/A480M. 
10.5 Results of the product analysis for the backing steel 
when required shall conform to the requirements of Section 7 
of Specification A20/A20M. 
11. Permissible Variations 
11.1 Permissible variations except for thickness shall be in 
accordance with Specification A20/ A20M. 
11.2 Minimum thickness of the alloy cladding metal and of 
the backing steel, or of the total composite plate shall be as 
required by purchase order documents when ordered to mini­
mum thicknesses. 
11.3 Permissible variation in thickness when ordered to 
nominal thicknesses shall be 0.01 in. (0.3 mm) under each for 
backing steel or total composite, and 0.03 in. (0.8 mm) under 
for the alloy cladding . 
11.4 Permissible variations for excess thickness of the total 
composite shall be the greater of 0.125 in. (3 mm) or 10 % of 
the total composite thickness ordered and may occur in either 
backing steel, cladding, or both, provided the minimum for 
each is met. 
11.5 More restrictive or less restrictive permissible varia­
tions may be agreed upon by the purchaser and the manufac­
turer. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The material shall be free of injurious defects, shall 
have a workmanlike appearance, and shall conform to the 
designated finish. 
12.2 Plate alloy surfaces shall be blasted (descaled by 
means such as sand or stainless grit, shot or wire, or 
equivalent), pickled, blast-cleaned and pickled, or 100 % 
conditioned. 
13. Bond Quality 
13.1 The cladding metal shall be integrally and continu­
ously bonded to the base metal. 
13.2 Inspection: 
13.2.1 Clad plates less than 3/s in. (10 mm) total minimum 
composite thickness shall be visually inspected for bond 
integrity prior to shipment. 
13.2.2 Clad plates 3/s in. (10 mm) and thicker total minimum 
composite thickness, and when specified by the purchaser, clad 
plates less than 3/s in. (10 mm) total minimum composite 
thickness, shall be ultrasonically inspected for bond integrity 
prior to shipment in accordance with the Procedures and 
Methods of Specification A578/A578M. 
13.2.3 Areas of non-bond detected visually shall be ex­
plored ultrasonically to determine the extent of the condition in 
accordance with 13.2.2. For purposes of defining non-bond, the 
cladding shall be interpreted to be unbonded when there is 
complete loss of back reflection accompanied by an echo 
indication from the plane of the interface of the clad and 
backing steel. Areas within 1 in. (25 mm) of a cut edge on the 
plate that contain indications exceeding 50 % of the back 
reflection at the bond interface shall be considered to be 
unbonded. 
13.2.4 Extent of ultrasonic examination shall be at the 
discretion of the manufacturer and sufficient enough to provide 
the quality level required by the purchaser. Plates may be 
ordered with 100 % coverage (Supplementary Requirements 
S12). 
13.3 Quality Levels: 
377 
13.3.1 Class I-No single unbonded area exceeding 1 in. 
(25 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not 
to exceed 1 % of the total cladded surface area. 
13.3.2 Class 3-No single unbonded area exceeding 3 in. 
(75 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not 
to exceed 3 % of the total cladded surface area. 
13.3.3 • Class 5-No single unbonded area exceeding 9 in.2 
(58 cm 2 ) with total unbonded area not to exceed 5 % of the 
total cladded surface area.
