SA-645/SA-645M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, 5 % and 5½ % Nickel Alloy Steels, 
Specially Heat Treated 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers specially heat treated 5 % and 
5 ½ % nickel alloy steel plates intended primarily for welded 
pressure vessels for service at low or cryogenic temperatures. 
1.2 The maximum thickness of plates which can be supplied 
under this specification is limited only by the capacity of the 
material to meet the specified requirements. 
1.3 This material is susceptible to magnetization. Use of 
magnets in handling after heat treatment should be avoided if 
residual magnetism would be detrimental to subsequent fabri­
cation or service. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.5 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica­
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.

3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Plates supplied to this material specification shall con­
form to Specification A20/ A20M. These requirements outline 
the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permitted 
variations in dimensions and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and 
shall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirements of 
Specification A20/ A20M. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 Grade A plates shall be heat treated in accordance with 
5.2. Grade B plates shall be heat treated in accordance with 5.3. 
Shell plates and other parts, including heads and reinforcing 
pads that are heated above 1125°F [605°C] for forming, shall 
be heat treated after forming, 
5.2 Grade A, Procedure and Sequence: 
5.2.1 Hardening-The plates shall be heated to a tempera­
ture within the range from 1575 to 1675°F [855 to 915°C], held 
within that temperature range for a minimum of 1 h/in. [2.4 
min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 15 min, and then 
water-quenched to below 300°F [150°C]. 
5.2.2 Intermediate Heat Treatment-The plates shall be 
reheated to a temperature within the range from 1275 to 
1058
