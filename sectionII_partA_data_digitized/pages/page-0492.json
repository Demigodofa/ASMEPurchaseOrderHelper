Scope \n1.1 This specification covers the chemical and mechanical \nrequirements of three grades of carbon steel bolts and studs in \nsizes \u00bc in. through 4 in. The fasteners are designated by \n\"Grade\" denoting tensile strength and intended use, as follows: \nGrade \nGrade A \nDescription \nBolts and studs having a \nminimum tensile strength of \n60 ksi and intended for \ngeneral applications, \nGrade B Bolts and studs having a \ntensile strength of 60 to 100 \nksi and intended for flanged \njoints in piping systems with \ncast iron flanges, and \nGrade C Replaced by Specification \nF1554 Gr.36 \n1.1.1 The term studs includes stud stock, sometimes re\u00ad\nferred to as threaded rod. \n1.2 This specification does not cover requirements for \nmachine screws, thread cutting/forming screws, mechanical \nexpansion anchors or similar externally threaded fasteners. \n1.3 Suitable nuts are covered in Specification A563. Unless \notherwise specified, the grade and style of nut for each grade of \nfastener, of all surface finishes, shall be as follows: \nFastener Grade and Size \nA\u00bcto 1\u00bd in. \nA over 1\u00bd to 4 in. \nB, \u00bcto 4 in. \nNut Grade and StyleA \nA, hex \nA, heavy hex \nA, heavy hex \nA Nuts of other grades and styles having specified proof load stresses (Speci\u00ad\nfication A563, Table 3) greater than the specified grade and style of nut are also \nsuitable. \n1.4 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded \nas the standard. \n1.5 Supplementary Requirement S 1 of an optional nature is \nprovided, which describes additional restrictions to be applied \nwhen bolts are to be welded. It shall apply only when specified \nin the inquiry, order, and contract. \n1.6 Terms used in this specification are defined in Termi\u00ad\nnology Fl 789 unless otherwise defined herein. \n2.
