9.2 The following are some of the commonly accepted 
techniques employed for routine chemical analysis of steels. 
These routine analyses are the basis for the producers' quality 
control/assurance programs. Proprietary methods are permis­
sible provided the results are equivalent to those obtained from 
standard methods when applicable. 
9.2.1 Analysis of stainless steels using x-ray fluorescence 
spectroscopy (XRF). See Table 1 for normal elements and 
ranges for stainless steels. 
9.2.2 Analysis of stainless steels using spark emission 
spectroscopy (OBS). See Table 2 for normal elements and 
ranges for stainless steels. 
9.2.3 Analysis of solutions using an atomic absorption 
spectrophotometer. 
9.2.4 Analysis of solutions using an inductively coupled 
plasma emission spectrometer. 
9.2.5 Determination of carbon or sulfur, or both, by com­
bustion (in oxygen) and measurement of CO 2 or S0 2 , or both, 
by thermal conductivity or infrared detectors.

9.3 There are additional common techniques often used for 
chemical analysis of standards for instrument analysis such as: 
polarographic analysis, ion exchange separations, 
radioactivation, and mass spectrometry. 
10. Reference Materials 
10.1 For referee analyses, reference standards of a recog­
nized standardizing agency shall be employed with preference 
given to NIST standard reference materials when applicable. 
(NIST does not produce reference standards suitable for all 
elements or all alloys.) 
10.1.1 When standard reference materials for certain alloys 
are not available from NIST, reference materials may be 
produced by employing ASTM standard procedures and NIST 
standard reference materials to the extent that such procedures 
and reference standards are available. Several independent 
laboratories should be used for certification of these standards 
and their results statistically reviewed and merged. 
10.1.2 Test methods not published by ASTM, such as a 
definitive analytical method, may be used when the method is 
validated by analyzing certified reference materials along with 
the candidate reference material. Examples of definitive ana­
lytical methods include gravimetric, coulometry, titrimetric 
based on normality, and mass spectrometry. 
10.2 Working reference materials may be used for routine 
analytical control. 
11. Significant Numbers 
11.1 Laboratories shall report each element to the same 
number of significant numbers as used in the pertinent material 
specifications.
