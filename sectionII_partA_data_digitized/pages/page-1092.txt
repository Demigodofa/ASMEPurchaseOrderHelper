TABLE S1.6 Thickness Tolerances [Metric] for Cold-Rolled Sheet (All Designatlons)A-10-mm Minimum Edge Distance 
NoTE I-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than 10 mm from a side edge. 
NoTE 2-Widths up to and including 300 mm in this table apply to widths produced by slitting from wider sheet. 
NoTE 3-Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in. 
[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm]. 
Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements. 
NOTE 4-This table was used to construct Table Al.12 by multiplying the values in this table by 0.50 and rounding to 2 decimal places using standard 
ASTM practice. 
NOTE 5-The thickness of material <25-mm wide shall be measured at mid-width.

Al. PERMISSIBLE VARIATIONS IN DIMENSIONS AND MASS IN SI UNITS 
Listed in Tables Al.l-Al.17 are permissible variations in dimensions and mass expressed in the International System of Units (SI) 
terminology.

(Carbon and Structural Steel Only)-15-mm (Cut Edge) and 
25-mm (Mill Edge) Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut 
Lengths, Including Pickled) 
NoTE I-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less 
than 15 mm from a cut edge and not less than 25 mm from a mill edge. 
This table does not apply to the uncropped ends of mill edge coils.
