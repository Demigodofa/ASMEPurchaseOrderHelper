Whenever no discernible surface tracing is possi\u00ad\nble, each indication which equals or exceeds the 0.5 in. reference amplitude shall be considered \n0.15 in. 2 [l cm 2 J (three times the area of the \u00be diameter [6 mm] flat bottomed hole to compensate for \nreflectivity degradation of natural flaw) for the cumulative area estimates. \nc The indications within a cluster with the cumulative areas traced shall be dispersed in a minimum sur\u00ad\nface area of the casting equal to 36 in. 2 [230 cm 2 J. If the cumulative areas traced are confined with a \nsmaller area of distribution, the area shall be repair welded to the extent necessary to meet the applica\u00ad\nble quality level. \nTABLE 5 \nDIMENSIONS OF CALIBRATION BLOCl<S FOR ANGLE-BEAM EXAMINATION \nNominal Production Basic Calibration Hole Diameter \nMaterial Thickness Block Thickness (dJ, in 1.002 Minimum Depth \n<t>, in.
