SA-369/SA-369M (ASTM A369/A369M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the 
purchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided 
in the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, 
retest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. 
Sl. Additional Tension Test 
S 1. 1 An additional tension test shall be made on a specimen 
from one or each end of each pipe. If this supplementary 
requirement is specified, the number of tests per pipe required 
shall be specified. If a specimen from any length fails to meet 
the required tensile properties (tensile, yield, and elongation), 
that length shall be rejected subject to retreatment in accor­
dance with Specification A999/ A999M and satisfactory retest. 
S2. Additional Flattening or Bend Tests 
S2. l The appropriate flattening or bend test may be made on 
specimens from both ends of each length of pipe. Crop ends 
may be used. If the specimen from either end of any length 
fails to conform to the specific requirement, that length shall be 
rejected. 
S3. Ultrasonic Tests 
S3.1 Each pipe shall be ultrasonically tested to determine its 
soundness throughout the entire length of the pipe. Until 
suitable standards are established, the basis for rejection of 
material shall be a matter of agreement between the manufac­
turer and purchaser. 
S4. Hydrostatic Test 
S4.1 A hydrostatic pressure test shall be applied as agreed 
upon by the manufacturer and purchaser. 
SS. Metal Structure and Etching Tests 
S5.l The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching 
tests conducted in accordance with the appropriate portions of 
Method E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section 
from one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound 
and reasonably uniform material free of injurious laminations, 
cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this supplementary 
requirement is specified, the number of tests per pipe required 
shall also be specified. If a specimen from any length shows 
objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, subject to 
removal of the defective end and subsequent retests indicating 
the remainder of the length to be sound and reasonably uniform 
material. 
S6. Alternative Heat Treatment-Grades FP91 Type 1 
and Type 2 and FP92 
S6.1 Grades FP91 Type 1 and Type 2 and FP92 shall be 
normalized in accordance with 5.4.3 or 5.4.4, respectively, and 
tempered at a temperature, to be specified by the purchaser, 
less than 1350 °F [730 °C]. It shall be the purchaser's 
responsibility to subsequently temper in the range of 1350 to 
1470 °F [730 to 800 °C]. All mechanical tests shall be made on 
material heat treated in accordance with 5.4.3 or 5.4.4, respec­
tively. The certification shall reference this supplementary 
requirement indicating the tempering temperature applied. The 
notation "S6'' shall be included with the required marking of 
the pipe. 
S7. Minimum Cooling Rate for Grade P91 Type 2 
S7.1 For Grade P91 Type 2 material, the heat treatment shall 
ensure that following austenitizing the rate of cooling from 
1650 °F to 900 °F [900 °C to 480 °C] is no slower than 9 
°F/min [5 °C/ min].
