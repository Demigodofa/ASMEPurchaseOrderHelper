3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions - The definitions in Test Methods and 
Definitions A 370 and Terminology A 941 are applicable 
to this specification and those listed in 1.1. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.1 heat, n - all the molten metal poured from a 
single furnace or all of the molten metal from two or more 
furnaces poured into a single ladle or casting prior to the 
replenishing of the furnace(s). 
3.2.2 investment casting, n - a metal casting that is 
produced in a mold obtained by investing (surrounding) 
an expendable pattern with a ceramic slurry, which is 
allowed to solidify. The expendable pattern may consist 
of wax, plastic, or other material and is removed prior to 
filling the mold with liquid metal. 
3.2.3 master heat, n - a single furnace charge of 
alloy that may be either poured directly into castings or 
into remelt alloy for individual melts. 
3.2.4 subheat, n - a portion of master heat remelted 
with only minor additions for deoxidation for pouring into 
castings. Syn. melt, production heat. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Melting Process - Master heats shall be made by 
the electric furnace process with or without separate refin­
ing such as argon-oxygen-decarburization (AOD), vac­
uum-oxygen-degassing (VOD), vacuum-induction­
melting (VIM), and so forth, unless otherwise specified in 
the individual specification or agreed upon between the 
customer and producer. Master heats may be used directly 
for producing castings or converted into ingot, bar, shot, 
or other suitable form, not including gates and risers from 
casting production, for later remelting as a subheat. 
4.2 Re-Melting Process - Subheats shall be produced 
from master heat metal in suitable batch sizes by electric 
induction furnace, with or without atmosphere protection, 
such as vacuum or inert gas unless otherwise agreed upon 
between the customer and producer. Revert (gates, sprues, 
risers, and rejected castings) shall not be remelted except 
in master heats. 
4.3 Heat Treatment: 
4.3.1 Ferritic and martensitic steel shall be cooled 
after pouring to provide substantially complete transforma­
tion of austenite prior to heat treatment to enhance mechani­
cal properties. 
4.3.2 Castings shall be heat treated in the working 
zone of a furnace that has been surveyed in accordance 
with Test Method A 991/A 991M.
