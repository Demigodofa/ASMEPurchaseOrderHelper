Scope \n1.1 This specification covers electric-resistance-welded \nlow-carbon steel pipe intended for use as process lines. \n1.2 Pipe ordered under this specification shall be suitable for \nsevere forming operations involving flanging in all sizes and \nbending to close radii up to and including NPS 4. \n1.3 This specification covers NPS \u00bd through 10, plus \nadditional sizes. The corresponding outside diameters and wall \nthicknesses for NPS \u00bd through 10 are listed in Table 1, as are \nthe dimensions for the additional sizes. \nNorn 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has \nbeen substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as \"nominal \ndiameter,\" \"size,\" and \"nominal size.\" \n1.4 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded \nas standard. The values given in parentheses are mathematical \nconversions to SI units that are provided for information only \nand are not considered standard. \n1.5 DELETED \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA53/A53M Specification for Pipe, Steel, Black and Hot\u00ad\nDipped, Zinc-Coated, Welded and Seamless \nA370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Testing \nof Steel Products \nA530/A530M Specification for General Requirements for \nSpecialized Carbon and Alloy Steel Pipe \nA751 Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology for Chemi\u00ad\ncal Analysis of Steel Products \nE213 Practice for Ultrasonic Testing of Metal Pipe and \nTubing \nE273 Practice for Ultrasonic Testing of the Weld Zone of \nWelded Pipe and Tubing \nE309 Practice for Eddy-Current Examination of Steel Tubu\u00ad\nlar Products Using Magnetic Saturation \nE570 Practice for Flux Leakage Examination of Ferromag\u00ad\nnetic Steel Tubular Products \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for material under this specification should \ninclude the following as required to describe the desired \nmaterial adequately: \n3.1.1 Quantity (feet or number of pieces), \n3.1.2 Name of material (electric-resistance-welded steel \npipe), \n3.1.3 Size (NPS or outside diameter and wall thickness), \n3.1.4 Length (definite cut length or random), \n3.1.5 Test report required (see 14.2), \n3.1.6 Specification number, and \n3.1.7 Special requirements. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Process-The steel shall be aluminum killed steel made \nby one or more of the following processes: open-hearth, \nbasic-oxygen, or electric-furnace. \n4.2 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When \nsteels of different grades are sequentially strand cast, identifi\u00ad\ncation of the resultant transition material is required. The \nproducer shall remove the transition material by any estab\u00ad\nlished procedure that positively separates the grades. \n4.3 Manufacture-The pipe shall be made by electric resis\u00ad\ntance welding. \n4.4 Heat Treatment-Pipe furnished in the as-welded con\u00ad\ndition shall be normalized at a temperature above the upper \n1024 \n, ~ , ",
