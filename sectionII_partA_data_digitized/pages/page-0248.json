A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers minimum-wall-thickness, \nelectric-resistance-welded tubes made of carbon steel and \ncarbon-manganese steel intended for use as boiler tubes, boiler \nflues, superheater flues, and safe ends. \n1.2 This specification covers Grades A, C, and D with \ndiffering chemical requirements (Section 6 and Table 1), \ndiffering tensile requirements (Section 9 and Table 2), and \ndiffering crush and mechanical testing requirements (Sections \n10 and 11). \nNOTE I-Grades C and D tubes are not suitable for safe-ending for \nforge welding. \n1.3 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to \nthis specification are \u00bd to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside \ndiameter and 0.035 to 0.360 in. [0.9 to 9.1 mm], inclusive, in \nminimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may \nbe furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other \nrequirements of this specification. \n1.4 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to \ntubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.Q15 \nin. [0.4 mm] in thickness. \n1.5 Optional supplementary requirements are provided and \nwhen desired, shall be so stated in the order. \n1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must \nbe used independently of the other. Combining values from the \ntwo systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi\u00ad\ncation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee A0l on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.09 on Carbon Steel Tubular Products. \nCurrent edition approved Nov. 1, 2019. Published November 2019.\u2022Originally \napproved in 1935. Last previous edition approved in 2012 as Al78/A178M-02 \n(2012). DOI: 10.1520/A0178_A0178M-19. \n2 For ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code applications see related Specifi\u00ad\ncation SA-178 in Section II of that Code. \n1.7 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
