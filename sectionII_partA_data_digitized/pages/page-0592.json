Scope \n1.1 This specification covers austenitic steel castings for \nvalves, flanges, fittings, and other pressure-containing parts \n(Note 1). \nNorn 1-Carbon steel castings for pressure-containing parts are cov\u00ad\nered by Specification A216/A216M, low-alloy steel castings by Specifi\u00ad\ncation A217/A217M, and duplex stainless steel castings by Specification \nA995! A995M. \n1.2 A number of grades of austenitic steel castings are \nincluded in this specification. Since these grades possess \nvarying degrees of suitability for service at high temperatures \nor in corrosive environments, it is the responsibility of the \npurchaser to determine which grade shall be furnished. Selec\u00ad\ntion will depend on design and service conditions, mechanical \nproperties, and high-temperature or corrosion-resistant \ncharacteristics, or both. \n1.2.1 Because of thermal instability, Grades CE20N, CF3A, \nCF3MA, and CF8A are not recommended for service at \ntemperatures above 800 \u00b0F [425 \u00b0C). \n1.3 Supplementary requirements of an optional nature are \nprovided for use at the option of the purchaser. The Supple\u00ad\nmentary requirements shall apply only when specified indi\u00ad\nvidually by the purchaser in the purchase order or contract. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n540 \n1.4.1 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound \nunits and in SI units; however, unless the purchase order or \ncontract specifies the applicable M-specification designation \n(SI units), the inch-pound units shall apply. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets or parentheses. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
