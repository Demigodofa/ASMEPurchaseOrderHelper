Scope \n1. 1 This specification covers five grades of bolting mate\u00ad\nrials with twelve classes of yield strength ranging from 50 to \n120 ksi [345 to 827 MPa] for use in high-temperature service \nfor bolting components, such as bolts, screws, nuts, or studs, \nfor pressure vessel and valve flanges. See Specification A962/ \nA962M for the definition of bolting. The material requires \nspecial processing and is not intended for general purpose \napplications. \n1.2 The following referenced general requirements are in\u00ad\ndispensable for application of this specification: Specification \nA962/A962M. \n1.3 Supplementary Requirements are provided for use at the \noption of the purchaser. The Supplementary Requirements \nshall only apply when specified individually by the purchaser \nin the purchase order or contract. \n1 .4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units \nand in SI units; however, unless the purchase order or contract \nspecifies the applicable \"M\" specification designation (SI \nunits), the inch-pound units shall apply. \n1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. \nI.6 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom-\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA193/A193M Specification for Alloy-Steel and Stainless \nSteel Bolting for High Temperature or High Pressure \nService and Other Special Purpose Applications \nA962/ A962M Specification for Common Requirements for \nBolting Intended for Use at Any Temperature from Cryo\u00ad\ngenic to the Creep Range \nE139 Test Methods for Conducting Creep, Creep-Rupture, \nand Stress-Rupture Tests of Metallic Materials \nE292 Test Methods for Conducting Time-for-Rupture Notch \nTension Tests of Materials \n3. Terminology \n3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.1.1 heat-treatment charge-one heat of material heat \ntreated in one batch. If a continuous operation is used, the \nweight processed as a heat-treatment charge shall not exceed \nthe weights in Table 1. \n3.1.2 lot-a lot shall consist of the quantities shown in Table \n2. \n756 \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 The inquiry and order shall indicate the following: \n4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), \n4.1.2 Description of item (bars, bolts, nuts, etc.), \n4.1.3 Grade and class (see Table 3), \n4.1.4 Method of finishing (see 6.1), \n4.1.5 Type of thread desired (see 6.1.1), \n4.1.6 Alternative test method option (see 8.2.4.3), \n4.1.7 Bolt shape option, if any, \n4.1.8 Thread option, if any, \n4.1.9 Test method for surface quality, if any, ",
