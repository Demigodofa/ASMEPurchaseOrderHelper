Chemical Composition \n6.1 Heat Analysis: \n6.1.1 A chemical heat analysis in accordance with Specifi\u00ad\ncation A961/A961M shall be made and conform to the \nrequirements as to chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. \nLeaded steels shall not be permitted. \n6.2 Product Analysis: \n6.2.1 The purchaser may make a product analysis on prod\u00ad\nucts supplied to this specification in accordance with Specifi\u00ad\ncation A961/A961M. \n7. Mechanical Properties \n7.1 Tension Tests: \n7.1.1 Requirements-The material shall conform to require\u00ad\nments for tensile properties in Table 2. \n7 .1.1.1 The test specimen shall be obtained from a rough or \nfinished forging, or prolongation thereof. For forgings under \n10 000 lbs, at time of heat treatment, it may be obtained from \nseparately forged test blanks from the same heat of steel as the \nproduction forgings. The test blank shall be reduced by forging \nin a manner similar to that for the products represented, and \nshall receive approximately the same hot working and reduc\u00ad\ntion and the same heat treatment as the finished products \nrepresented. The test material shall be treated in the same \nfurnace at the same time as the forging it represents, subject to \nthe requirements of 7 .1.2.1. \n7 .1.1.2 The test specimen shall represent all forgings from \nthe same heat and heat-treatment load whose maximum thick\u00ad\nnesses do not exceed the thickness of the test forging or blank \nby more than \u00bc in. [6 mm]. \n7 .1.2 Number of Tests-One tension test at room tempera\u00ad\nture shall be made in accordance with 7 .1.1.2 from each heat in \neach heat-treatment load. \n7 .1.2.1 If heat treatment is performed in either a continuous \nor a batch-type furnace controlled within \u00b125 \u00b0F [\u00b114 \u00b0C] of \nthe required heat-treatment temperature and equipped with \nrecording pyrometers so that complete records of heat treat\u00ad\nment are available and if the same heat-treating cycles are used \non the forgings represented by the tension test, then one tension \ntest from each heat shall be required, instead of one tension test \nfrom each heat in each heat treatment load in accordance with \n7.1.1.2. \n7 .1.3 Test Locations and Orientations-The test specimen \nshall be removed from the heaviest section of the forging or \ntest blank, at locations described in 7.1.3.1, 7.1.3.2, 7.1.3.5 or \nas close to these locations as practical, subject to forging size \nand geometry. \n7.1.3.1 For forgings or test blanks having a maximum \nheat-treated thickness, T, of 2 in. [50 mm] or less, the \nlongitudinal axis of the test specimen shall be taken at \nmid-thickness and its mid-length shall be at least 2 in. [50 mm] \nfrom all other heat treated surfaces, exclusive of the T \ndimension surfaces. (This is normally referred to as V2 T by 2 \nin. [50 mm]). See Fig. 1 for test specimen location in separately \nforged test blanks. \n7.1.3.2 For forgings or test blanks having a maximum \nheat-treated thickness, T, greater than 2 in.
