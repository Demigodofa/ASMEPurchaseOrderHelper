Dimensions, Tolerances, and Allowances \n8.1 Dimensions, tolerances, and allowances applicable to \nproducts covered by this specification are contained in Tables \n3-20 [Annex Al, Tables Al.l-Al.17]. The appropriate toler\u00ad\nance tables shall be identified in each individual specification. \n8.2 The appropriate thickness tolerance tables for measure\u00ad\nments taken 3/s in. [10 mm] from the edge are found in Section \nS 1 of the Supplementary Requirements in this specification. \nSee the appropriate product specification for instructions on \nhow to specify. \n8.3 When thickness is measured using hand held microm\u00ad\neters refer to Practice A1073/A1073M. \n8.4 Flatness Tolerances: \n8.4.1 Standard flatness tolerances are contained in Tables 13 \nand 14 for hot-rolled sheet and Table 20 for cold-rolled sheet. \n8.4.2 Measurement techniques for flatness characteristics \nare described in Practice A1030/Al030M. \n8.4.3 Two alternative methods for flatness determination are \nthe use of I-units and percent steepness. A description of these \ntwo alternative methods is contained in Practice A1030/ \nA1030M, as well as Appendix X5. \n8.4.3.1 The use of I-units or percent steepness as a flatness \nstandard is subject to negotiation between the purchaser and \nthe producer. \n8.4.3.2 Measurement techniques for I-units, percent \nsteepness, and rejection limits are subject to negotiation \nbetween the purchaser and the producer. \n9. Finish and Condition \n9.1 Hot-rolled sheet has a surface with an oxide or scale \nresulting from the hot-rolling operation. The oxide or scale can \nbe removed by piclding or blast cleaning when required for \npress-work operations or welding. Hot-rolled and hot-rolled \ndescaled sheet is not generally used for exposed parts where \n- sutface-is-0f prime_importanc_e_._ _ _ _ _ _ \nparticular contour. They may also contain some edge \nimperfections, the more common types of which are cracked \nedges, thin edges (feather), and damaged edges due to handling \nor processing and which should not extend in beyond the \nordered width. These edge conditions are detrimental where \njoining of the mill edges by welding is practiced. When the \npurchaser intends to shear or to blank, a sufficient width \nallowance should be made when purchasing to ensure obtain\u00ad\ning the desired contour and size of the pattern sheet. The \nmanufacturer may be consulted for guidance. Cut edges are the \nnormal edges which result from the shearing, slitting, or \ntrimming of mill-edge sheet. \n9.1.1.1 The ends of plain hot-rolled mill-edge coils are \nirregular in shape and are referred to as uncropped ends. Where \nsuch ends are not acceptable, the purchaser's order should so \nspecify. Processed coils such as pickled or blast cleaned are \nsupplied with square-cut ends. \n9.2 Cold-rolled carbon sheet (exposed) is intended for those \napplications where surface appearance is of primary impor\u00ad\ntance. This class will meet requirements for controlled surface \ntexture, surface quality, and flatness. It is normally processed \nby the manufacturer to be free of stretcher strain and fluting. \nSubsequent user roller leveling immediately before fabrication \nwill minimize strain resulting from aging. \n9.2.1 Cold-rolled carbon sheet, when ordered for exposed \napplications, can be supplied in the following finishes: \n9.2.1.1 Matte finish is a dull finish, without luster, produced \nby rolling on rolls that have been roughened by mechanical or \nchemical means to various degrees of surface texture depend\u00ad\ning upon application. With some surface preparation matte \nfinish is suitable for decorative painting. It is not generally \nrecommended for bright plating. \n9 .2.1.2 Commercial bright finish is a relatively bright finish \nhaving a surface texture intermediate between that of matte and \nluster finish. With some surface preparation commercial bright \nfinish is suitable for decorative painting or certain plating \napplications. If sheet is deformed in fabrication the surface \nmay roughen to some degree and areas so affected will require \nsurface preparation to restore surface texture to that of the \nundeformed areas; \n9.1.1 Hot-rolled sheet can be supplied with mill edges or cut \nedges as specified. Mill edges are the natural edges resulting \nfrom the hot-rolling operation. They do not conform to any \n~2.13 Luster finish 1s asmootfioright 1inisli produced by -\nrolling on ground rolls and is suitable for decorative painting or \nplating with additional special surface preparation by the user. \nTABLE 3 List of Tables for Dimensions, Tolerances, and Allowances \nDimensions \nCamber tolerances \nDiameter tolerances of sheared circles \nFlatness tolerances \nLength tolerances \nOut-of-square tolerances \nRestricted squareness tolerances \nThickness tolerances \nWidth tolerances of cut edge \nWidth tolerances of mill edge \nCarbonA and High-Strength Low-Alloy Steel \nHot-Rolled Sheet \nInch-Pound Units \n10 \n9 \n13, 14 \n8 \n11 \n12 \n4, 5, S1.1, S1.2 \n7 \n6 \nSI Units \nA1.7 \nA1.6 \nA1.10, A1.11 \nA1.5 \nA1.8 \nA1.9 \nA1.1, A1.2, S1.4, S1.5 \nA1.4 \nA1.3 \nTable No. \nA Tolerances for hot-rolled carbon sheet steel with 0.25 % maximum carbon, cast or heat analysis. \n983 \nCold-Rolled Sheet \nInch-Pound Units \n10, 19 \n9 \n20 \n16, 17 \n11 \n12 \n15,S1.3 \n7, 18 \nSI Units \nA1.7, A1.16 \nA1.6 \nA1.17 \nA1.13, A1.14 \nA1.8 \nA1.9 \nA1.12, S1.6 \nA1.4,A1.15 ",
