c Quenched in water or rapidly cooled by other means, at a rate sufficient to 
prevent re-precipitation of carbides, as demonstrable by the capability of pipes, 
heat treated by either separate solution annealing or by direct quenching, of 
passing Practices A262, Practice E. The manufacturer is not required to run the 
test unless it is specified on the purchase order (see Supplementary Requirement 
S7). Note that Practices A262 requires the test to be performed on sensitized 
specimens in the low-carbon and stabilized types and on specimens representa­
tive of the as-shipped condition for other types. In the case of low-carbon types 
containing 3 % or more molybdenum, the applicability of the sensitizing treatment 
prior to testing shall be a matter for negotiation between the seller and the 
purchaser.

11.2 Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One tension 
test shall be made on a specimen for lots of not more than 100 
pipes. Tension tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes 
for lots of more than 100 pipes. 
11.3 Flattening Test-For material heat treated in a continu­
ous furnace, by quenching after hot forming or in a batch-type 
furnace equipped with recording pyrometers and automatically 
controlled within a 50 °F [30 °C] or lesser range, flattening 
tests shall be made on a sufficient number of pipe to constitute 
5 % of the lot, but in no case less than 2 lengths of pipe. For 
material heat treated in a batch-type furnace not equipped with 
recording pyrometers and automatically controlled within a 50 
°F [30 °C] or lesser range, flattening tests shall be made on 5 % 
of the pipe from each heat treated lot. 
11.3.1 For welded pipe a transverse-guided face bend test of 
the weld may be conducted instead of a flattening test in 
accordance with the method outlined in the steel tubular 
product supplement of Test Methods and Definitions A370. For 
welded pipe with a specified wall thickness over 3/s in., two 
side bend tests may be made instead of the face bend test. The 
ductility of the weld shall be considered acceptable when there 
is no evidence of cracks in the weld or between the weld and 
the base metal after bending. Test specimens from 5 % of the 
lot shall be taken from the pipe or test plates of the same 
material as the pipe, the test plates being attached to the end of 
the cylinder and welded as a prolongation of the pipe longitu­
dinal seam. 
11.4 Grain Size-Grain size determinations, in accordance 
with Test Methods E112, shall be made on the grades listed in 
Table 5. Grain size determinations shall be made on each heat 
treatment lot, as defined in 11.1, for the same number of pipes 
as prescribed for the flattening test in 11.3. The grain size 
results shall conform to the requirements prescribed in Table 5.
