ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-232/SA-232M 
from a test specimen preferably taken during the pouring 
of the heat. When requested, this shall be reported to the 
purchaser and shall conform to the requirement of Table 2. 
5.3 Product Analysis - An analysis may be made by 
the purchaser from finished wire representing each heat of 
steel. The average of all the separate determinations made 
shall be within the limits specified in the analysis column. 
Individual determinations may vary to the extent shown 
in the product analysis tolerance column, except that the 
several determinations of a single element in any one heat 
shall not vary both above and below the specified range. 
5.4 For referee purposes, Test Methods, Practices and 
Terminology A 751 shall be used. 
6. Mechanical Requirements 
6.1 Annealed and Cold Drawn - When purchased in 
the annealed and cold-drawn condition, the wire shall have 
been given a sufficient amount of cold working to meet the 
purchaser's coiling requirements and shall be in a suitable 
condition to respond properly to heat treatment. In special 
cases the hardness, if desired, shall be stated in the pur­
chase order. 
6.2 Oil Tempered - When purchased in the oil-tem­
pered condition, the tensile strength and minimum percent 
reduction of area, sizes 2.50 mm [0.105 in.] and coarser, 
of the wire shall conform to the requirements prescribed 
in Table 1. 
6.2.1 Number of Tests - One test specimen shall be 
taken for each five coils, or fraction thereof, in a lot. Each 
heat in a given lot shall be tested. 
6.2.2 Location of Tests - Test specimens shall be 
taken from either end of the coil. 
6.2.3 Test Method - The tension test shall be made 
in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
6.3 Wrap Test: 
6.3.1 Oil-tempered or cold-drawn wire 4.00 mm 
[0.162 in.] and smaller in diameter shall wind on itself as 
an arbor without breakage. Larger diameter wire up to 
and including 8.00 mm [0.312 in.] in diameter shall wrap 
without breakage on a mandrel twice the wire diameter. 
The wrap test is not applicable to wire over 8.00 mm 
[0.312 in.] in diameter. 
6.3.2 Number of Tests - One test specimen shall be 
taken for each five coils or fraction thereof, in a lot. Each 
heat in a given lot shall be tested. 
6.3.3 Location of Test - Test specimens shall be 
taken from either end of the coil. 
6.3.4 Test Method -The wrap test shall be made in 
accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
7. Metallurgical Requirements 
7.1 Su,face Condition: 
7.1.1 The surface of the wire as received shall be 
free of imperfections such as pits, die marks, scratches, 
seams, and other defects tending to impair the fatigue value 
of the springs. 
7.1.2 Number of Tests - One test specimen shall be 
taken from each end of every coil. 
7.1.3 Test Method - The surface shall be examined 
after etching in a solution of equal parts of hydrochloric 
acid and water that has been heated to approximately 80°C 
for a sufficient length of time to remove up to approxi­
mately 1 % of the diameter of the wire. Test ends shall be 
examined using 10 X magnification. 
7 .2 Decarburization: 
7.2.1 Transverse sections of the wire properly 
mounted, polished, and etched shall show no completely 
decarburized (carbon-free) areas when examined at a mag­
nification of 100 diameters. Partial decarburization shall 
not exceed a depth of 0.025 mm [0.001 in.] on wire 
5.00 mm [0.192 in.] and smaller or 0.038 mm [0.0015 in.] 
on larger than 5.00 mm [0.192 in.]. 
7.2.2 To reveal the decarburization more accurately 
in the untempered wire, the specimen shall be hardened 
and tempered before microscopical examination. Prior to 
hardening, the specimen shall be filed flat on one side 
enough to reduce the diameter at least 20%. The subsequent 
mounted specimen shall show the flattened section, as well 
as the original wire edge. Any decarburization on this 
flattened section shall necessitate a new specimen for exam­
ination. 
323 
7.2.3 Number of Tests - One test specimen shall be 
taken for each five coils, or fraction thereof, in a lot. Each 
in a given lot shall be tested. 
7.2.4 Location of Tests - Test specimens may be 
taken from either end of the coil. 
8. Dimensions and Permissible Variations 
8.1 The permissible variations in the diameter of the 
wire shall be specified in Table 3. 
8.2 Number of Tests - One test specimen shall be taken 
from each end of every coil. 
9. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
9.1 Annealed and Cold Drawn - The wire shall not be 
kinked or improperly cast. To test for cast, a few convolu­
tions of wire shall be cut loose from the coil and placed 
on a flat surface. The wire shall lie substantially flat on 
itself and not spring up nor show a wavy condition.
