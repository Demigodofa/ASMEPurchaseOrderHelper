area values when below a minimum value. This minimum 
value may be from 1.5 to 2.5, depending on the material. 
Below this minimum value, the reduction at the failure point in 
the reduced section is restrained by the larger cross section 
away from the reduced section. A minimum slenderness ratio 
of 2 was selected for the standard Type 2 specimen to allow a 
0.500-in. (12.5-mm] diameter specimen to be used on a 1-in. 
[25-mm] plate. A minimum slenderness ratio of 2.5 was 
selected for the collar-button specimens (Types D, E, and F) to 
ensure that this effect is minimized for these test specimens.
