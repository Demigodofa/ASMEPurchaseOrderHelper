SA-574 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SPECIFICATION FOR ALLOY STEEL 
SOCKET-HEAD CAP SCREWS 
SA-574 
(Identical with ASTM Specification A 574-04e 1 except that Table 1 on chemical requirements has been deleted and Supplementary Requirement Sl 
is now mandatory. Paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2 have been revised to refer to Table S 1. 1 and para. 6.3 has been deleted.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers the requirements for 
quenched and tempered alloy steel hexagon socket-head 
cap screws, 0.060 through 4 in. in diameter where high 
strength is required. 
NOTE 1 - A complete metric companion to Specification A 574 has 
been developed-A 574M; therefore no metric equivalents are presented 
in this specification. 
1.2 The following hazard caveat pertains only to the 
test method portion, Section 12, of this specification. This 
standard does not purport to address all of the safety 
concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsi­
bility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate 
safety and health practices and determine the applicability 
of regulatory limitations prior to use.

3.1 Definitions: 
3.1.1 Definitions of discontinuities covered by 10.2 
follow: 
3.1.2 crack- clean crystalline break passing through 
the grain or grain boundary without inclusion of foreign 
elements. 
3.1.3 inclusions - particles of nonmetallic impuri­
ties, usually oxides, sulfides, silicates, and such, which are 
mechanically held in the steel during solidification. 
3.1.4 nicks or pits - depressions or indentations in 
the surface of the metal. 
3.1.5 seam or lap - noncrystalline break through the 
metal which is inherently in the raw material.
