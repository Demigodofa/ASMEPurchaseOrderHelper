Scope \n1.1 This specification covers ductile iron castings suitable \nfor service at temperatures of -40\u00b0F [-40\u00b0C] and above. \n1.2 The values stated in either inch-pound or SI units are to \nbe regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the SI units \nare shown in brackets. The values stated in each system are not \nexact equivalents; therefore, each system shall be used inde\u00ad\npendently of the other. Combining values from the two systems \nmay result in nonconfonnance with the specification. \n1.3 The following precautionary statement pertains only to \nthe test methods portion, Section 11, of this specification: This \nstandard does not pwport to address all of the safety concerns, \n(f' any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user \nof this standard to establish appropriate safety and health \npractices and determine the applicability of regulatory limita\u00ad\ntions prior to use. \n2.

Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for material under this specification shall include \nthe following applicable information: \n3.1.1 Drawing, catalog number, or part identification, \n3.1.2 Quantity (weight or number of pieces), \n3.1.3 ASTM designation and year of issue, \n3.1.4 Marking instructions (see Section 15), \n3.1.5 Place of inspection (see 13.1), \n3.1.6 Limits on residual elements (see 5.2), \n3.1.7 Visual and dimensional acceptance standard (see 7.1), \n3.1.8 Sampling plan (see Section 9), and \n3.1.9 Supplementary requirements. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Castings may be supplied either as cast or heat treated \nand shall have essentially a ferritic structure that contains no \nmassive carbides. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5 .1 The iron shall conform to the requirements for chemical \ncomposition shown in Table 1. \n5.2 By agreement between the manufacturer and purchaser, \nanalysis may be required and limits established for elements \nnot specified in Table 1. \n6. Mechanical and Microstructural Properties \n6.1 Tensile Properties-The iron shall conform to the re\u00ad\nquirements for tensile properties shown in Table 2. \n6.2 Microstructure-Graphite contained in the microstruc\u00ad\nture shall be evaluated in accordance with Test Method A 24 7. \nThe percent of each graphite type shall be estimated, and the \ntotal of an estimates shall equal 100 %. The total percent of \nTypes I and 2 graphite shall be a minimum of 90 %. \n7. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n7 .1 The surface of the casting shall be examined visually \nand shall be free from adhering sand, scale, cracks, and hot \ntears. Other surface discontinuities shall meet visual and \ndimensional acceptance standards specified in the order. \n1372 ",
