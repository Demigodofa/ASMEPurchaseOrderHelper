The heat \nanalysis of a multiple heat identified by a single heat number is the \nweighted average analysis of the individual primary heats contained in \nthe multiple heat. Two or more molten primary heats sequentially \nstrand cast (poured- into an oscillating mold) constitute a series of \nindividual heats, not a multiple heat. \nnatural aging, n-spontaneous aging of a super-saturated solid \nsolution at room temperature. \nnickel alloy, n-a material that conforms to a specification that \nrequires by mass percent more nickel than any other ele\u00ad\nment. \nDiscussION-ln castings, the nickel content requirement is not \nnormally stated in the specification and is not normally determined by \nchemical analysis, but is taken to be 100 % minus the sum of the mean \nvalues permitted by the specification for all other elements having a \nspecified range or a specified maximum. \nnitriding, n-introducing nitrogen into a solid steel object by \nholding it at a suitable temperature in contact with a \nnitrogenous environment. \nnonferrous material, n-metals and alloys that do not contain \niron as the principal component. \nDiscussION-The iron content is not always stated in the specification \nand is not always determined by chemical analysis. The iron content \nmay be taken to be 100 % minus the sum of the mean values permitted \nby the specification for all other elements having a specified range or a \nspecified maximum. For conformance purposes, the mean value for \niron, whether specified or calculated, is compared on an individual \nbasis to the mean values permitted by the specification for each of the \nother elements having a specified range or a specified maximum. If an \nelement other than iron is not specified, but is listed as remainder or \nbalance, then, for conformance purposes, the mean value for iron is \ncompared to the calculated value for that other element. \nnormalizing, v-reheating a steel object to a temperature \nabove the transformation range and then cooling it in air to \na temperature substantially below the transformation range \nto achieve both grain refinement and improved homogeni\u00ad\nzation. \noveraging, n-aging under conditions of time and temperature \ngreater than those required to obtain maximum change in a \ncertain prope1ty, so that the property is altered away from the \nmaximum. \noverheating, n-heating a steel object to such a high tempera\u00ad\nture that excessive grain growth occurs. \n1384 ",
