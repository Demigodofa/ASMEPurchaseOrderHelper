SA-524/SA-524M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Seamless Carbon Steel Pipe for Atmospheric and Lower 
Temperatures 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers seamless carbon steel pipe 
intended primarily for service at atmospheric and lower 
temperatures, NPS 1/s to 26 [DN 6 to 650] inclusive, with 
nominal (average) wall thickness as given in ANSI B36.10. 
Pipe having other dimensions may be furnished, provided such 
pipe complies with all other requirements of this specification. 
Pipe ordered to this specification shall be suitable both for 
welding, and for bending, flanging, and similar forming opera­
tions. 
1.2 The product is available in two grades (Tables 1 and 2). 
1.3 Product may be either of hot finished or cold drawn 
manufacture (see 5.1.4 and 5.1.5). 
1.4 Units-This specification is expressed in both inch­
pound units and in SI units; however, unless the purchase order 
or contract specifies the applicable M specification designation 
(SI units), the inch-pound units shall apply. The values stated in 
either inch-pound units or SI units are to be regarded separately 
as standard. Within the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. 
The values stated in each system may not be exact equivalents; 
therefore, each system shall be used independently of the other. 
Combining values from the two systems may result in noncon­
formance with the standard. The values stated in inch-pound 
units are to be regarded as standard. The values given in 
parentheses are mathematical conversions to SI units that are 
provided for information only and are not considered standard. 
NoTE 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
establish appropriate safety, health, and environmental prac­
tices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations 
prior to use. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
