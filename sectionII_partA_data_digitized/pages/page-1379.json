When bright \nannealing is used, pickling is not necessary. \n4.1.4 H grades and S30815 shall have a grain size of 7 or \ncoarser when determined in accordance with ASME E112. \nGrain size determinations shall be made on each heat treatment \nlot, as defined in Section 12, for the same number of pipes as \nprescribed for the flattening test in 12.2. \n4.2 Heat Treatment: \n4.2.1 All pipe shall be furnished in the heat-treated condition. \nThe heat-treatment procedure, except for H grades, N08367, \nand S31254, shall consist of heating the pipe to a minimum \ntemperature of 1900 \u00b0F [1040 \u00b0C] and quenching in water or \nrapidly cooling by other means. \n4.2.2 All H grades and S30815 shall be furnished in the solution-\n,,~~ treated condtion. If cold working is involved in processing, the \nminimum solution treating temperature for Grades TP321H, \nTP347H, and TP348H shall be 2000 \u00b0F [1100 \u00b0C] and for \nGrades TP304H and TP316H, 1900 \u00b0F [1040 \u00b0C]. If the H \nGrade is hot rolled, the minimum solution treating tempera\u00ad\ntures for Grades TP321H, TP347H, and TP348H shall be \n1925 \u00b0F [1050 \u00b0C], and for Grades TP304H and TP316H, \n1900 \u00b0F [1040 \u00b0C]. The mimum temperature for S30815 shall \nbe 1920 \u00b0F [1050 \u00b0C]. \n4.2.3 The heat-treatment procedure for S31254 shall consist \nof heating the pipe to a minimum temperature of 2100 \u00b0F \n[1150 \u00b0C] and quenching in water or rapidly cooling by other \nmeans. \n4.2.4 S31727 and S32053 shall be heat treated 1975 to \n2155 \u00b0F [1080 to 1180 \u00b0C] followed by quenching in water or \nrapidly cooling by other means. \n4.2.5 UNS N08367 should be solution annealed from \n2025 \u00b0F [1107 \u00b0C] minimum followed by rapid quenching. \n4.2.6 DELETED \n4.2.7 DELETED \n4.2.8 DELETED \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical composition in \nTable 2. \n5.2 When specified on the purchase order, a product analy\u00ad\nsis shall be supplied from one tube or coil of steel per heat. The \nproduct analysis tolerance of Specification A480/ A480M shall \napply. \n6. Product Analysis \n6.1 At the request of the purchaser, an analysis of one length \nof flat-rolled stock from each heat, or one pipe from each lot \nshall be made by the manufacturer. A lot of pipe shall consist \nof the following number of lengths of the same size and wall \nthickness from any one heat of steel. \nNPS Number \nUnder2 \n2 to 5 inclusive \n6 and over \nLengths of Pipe in Lot \n400 or fraction thereof \n200 or fraction thereof \n100 or fraction thereof \n6.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the \npurchaser or his representative, and shall conform to the \nrequirements specified in Section 5. \n6.3 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 6.1 does \nnot conform to the requirements specified in Section 5, an \nanalysis of each length of flat-rolled stock from each heat or \npipe from the same heat or lot may be made, and all pipe \nconforming to the requirements shall be accepted. \n6.4 For referee purposes, Test Methods, Practices, and \nTerminology A751 shall be used. \n7. Tensile Requirements \n7 .1 The tensile properties of the material shall conform to \nthe requirements prescribed in Table 3. \n8. Permissible Variations in Dimensions \n8.1 Permissible variations in dimensions shall not exceed \nthe following at any point in each length of pipe. \nTABLE 3 Tensile Requirements \nTensile Yield \nGrade UNS Strength, Strength, \nDesignation min min \nksi [MPa] ksi [MPa] \nTP201 S20100 75 [515] 38 [260] \nTP201LN S20153 95 [665] 45 [310] \nTP304L S30403 70 [485] 25[170] \nTP316L S31603 70 [485] 25[170] \nTP304 S30400 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP304H S30409 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP309Cb S30940 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP309S S30908 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP310Cb S31040 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP310S S31008 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP316 S31600 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP316H S31609 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP317 S31700 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP317L S31703 75 [515] 30 [205] \nS31727 80 [550] 36 [245] \nS32053 93 [640] 43 [295] \nTP321 S32100 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP321H S32109 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP347 S34700 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP347H S34709 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP348 S34800 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP348H S34809 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTPXM-10 S21900 90 [620] 50 [345] \nTPXM-11 S21903 90 [620] 50 [345] \nTPXM-15 S38100 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTPXM-29 S24000 100 [690] 55 [380] \nTPXM-19 S20910 100 [690] 55 [380] \nTP304N S30451 80 [550] 35 [240] \nTP316N S31651 80 [550] 35 [240] \nTP304LN S30453 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP316LN S31653 75 [515] 30 [205] \nS31254 94 [650] 44 [300] \nS30815 87 [600] 45 [310] \nN08367 \nts 0.187 100 [690] 45 [310] \n1>0.187 95 [655] 45 [310] \nS31266 109 [750] 61 [420] \n1317 ",
