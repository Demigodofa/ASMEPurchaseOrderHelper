wall thickness), 
4.1.6 Length (specific or random), 
4.1. 7 End finish, 
4.1.8 Purchase options, if any (see 5.2.3, 11.3, ll.4, 13.1), 
and 
4.1.9 Supplementary requirements, if any (refer to Sl 
through Sl3). 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Materials-The steel plate material shall conform to the 
requirements of the applicable plate specification for the pipe 
grade ordered as listed in Table 1. 
5.2 Welding: 
5.2.1 The joints shall be double-welded full-penetration 
welds made in accordance with procedures and by welders or 
welding operators qualified in accordance with the ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX. 
5.2.2 The welds shall be made either manually or automati­
cally by an electric process involving the deposition of filler 
metal. 
5.2.3 The welded joints shall have positive reinforcement at 
the center of each side of the weld, but no more than 1/s in. [3
