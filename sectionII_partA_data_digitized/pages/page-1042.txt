SA-553/SA-553M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
7.2.3 Unless ·otherwise agreed, tests shall be conducted at 
-320°F [-195°C] for Type I or Type III, and at -275°F 
[-170°C] for Type II. 
7.2.4 Each test specimen shall have a lateral expansion 
opposite the notch of not less than 0.015 in. [0.381 mm]. 
8. Finish 
8.1 Because retained scale may mask surface imperfections, 
as well as mar the plate surface, plates shall be descaled by the 
producer after heat treatment. In the case of material to be 
heat-treated by the purchaser, the plates shall be descaled by 
the producer prior to shipment. 
9. Marking 
9.1 In addition to the marking required in Specification 
A20/ A20M, each plate shall be legibly stamped or stenciled, 
depending upon the ordered thickness, with the letters QT, 
except as otherwise specified in 9 .1.1. 
9.1.1 When the optional heat treatment in 5.2.2.1 is 
performed, the plates shall be marked with the letters QTT 
instead of QT. 
10. Keywords 
10.1 alloy steel; alloy steel plate; pressure containing parts; 
pressure vessel steels; steel plates; steel plates for pressure 
vessel applications 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
Supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the order. 
A list of standard supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser are included 
in Specification A20/A20M. Several of those considered suitable for use with this specification are 
listed below. by title. Other tests may be performed by agreement between the supplier and the 
purchaser. 
S 1. Vacuum Treatment, 
S2. Product Analysis, 
S3. Simulated Post-Weld Heat Treatment of Mechanical 
Test Coupons, 
S6. Drop Weight Test (for Material 0.625 in. [16 mm] and 
over in Thickness), 
S8. Ultrasonic Examination in accordance with Specifica­
tion A435/A435M, 
S9. Magnetic Particle Examination, 
S 11. Ultrasonic Examination in accordance with Specifica­
tion A577/A577M, 
Sl2. Ultrasonic Examination in accordance with Specifica­
tion A578/A578M, and 
S 17. Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized Steel. 
ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
Also listed below are additional optional Supplementary Requirements S55 and S56, which are 
suitable for this specification.

quirement 
S55.1 The longitudinal Charpy V-notch impact properties 
shall not be less than 25 ft•lbf [34 J] at the specified tempera­
ture. 
S55.2 Each impact test value shall constitute the average 
value of three specimens, with not more than one value below 
the specified minimum value of 25 ft·lbf [34 J] but in no case 
below 20 ft·lbf [27 J] for full size specimens. 
942 
S56. Transverse Charpy Impact Energy Absorption Re­
quirement 
S56.1 The transverse Charpy V-notch impact properties 
shall not be less than 20 ft·lbf [27 J] at the specified tempera­
ture. 
S56.2 Each impact test value shall constitute the average 
value of three specimens, with not more than one value below 
the specified minimum value of 20 ft•lbf [27 J] but in no case 
below 15 ft•lbf [20 J] for full size specimens.
