Terminology \n3.1 For definitions of terms relating to steel manufacturing \nand properties, refer to Tenninology A941. \n3.2 For definitions of terms relating to mechanical testing, \nrefer to Tenninology E6. \n3.3 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.3.1 burr, n-a rough or sharp edge left on pipe ends by \ncutting or sawing. \n3.3.2 lot, n-all pipe of the same size, wall thickness and \nrolled length that is produced from the same heat of steel and \nsubject to the same heat treatment. \n3.3.3 black thread, n-a thread crease exhibiting the original \npipe surface after machining. \n0 \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 Orders for material under this specification should \ninclude the following, as required, to describe the desired \nmaterial adequately: \n4.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), \n4.1.2 Name of product (electric-resistance-welded pipe), \n4.1.3 Specification designation and year of issue, \n4.1.4 Grade (see Table 1), \n4.1.5 Size (nominal size, NPS [DN], or outside diameter; \nand nominal wall thickness), \n4.1.6 Length (specific or random, see 12.4), \n4.1.7 End finish (plain or threaded, see 13.2), \n4.1.7.1 Threaded and coupled, if specified, \n4.1.7.2 Threads only, if specified, \n4.1.7.3 Plain end, if specified, \n4.1.8 Alternative electric test (see Section 11), \n4.1.9 Tension test specimen (see Section 15), \n4.1.10 Heat analysis, if required (see 6.1), \n4.1.11 Certificate of compliance, if required (see Section \n19), and \n4.1.12 Special requirements. \n5. Manufacture \n5.1 The steel shall be made by either or both of the \nfollowing processes: basic-oxygen or electric-furnace. \n5.2 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When \nsteels of different grades are sequentially strand cast, identifi\u00ad\ncation of the resultant transition material is required. The \nproducer shall remove the transition material by any estab\u00ad\nlished procedure that positively separates the grades. \n5.3 The pipe shall be manufactured from flat rolled steel in \nindividual lengths or in continuous length by electric-resistance \nor electric-induction welding without the addition of extrane\u00ad\nous material. \n187 \n5.4 The weld seam of electric-resistance welded pipe to \nGrade B pipe shall be heat treated after welding to a minimum \ntemperature of 1000 \u00b0F [540 \u00b0C] or processed in such a manner \nthat no untempered martensite remains. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements prescribed \nin Table 2, based on the heat analysis.
