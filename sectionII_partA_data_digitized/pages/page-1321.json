The \nlength of the riser at the top therefore \ndepends on the amount of taper added to \nthe riser. \nThe width of the riser at the base of a multi\u00ad\nple-leg coupon shall be n <2\u00bc> [57 mm] -\n% [16 mmJ where n equals the number of \nlegs attached to the coupon. The width of \nthe riser at the top is therefore dependent \non the amount of taper added to the riser. \nUse of and size is at the option of the foundry. \nThe minimum height of the riser shall be 2 in. \n[51 mm]. The maximum height is at the \noption of the foundry for the following rea\u00ad\nsons: (al many risers are cast open. (bl differ\u00ad\nent compositions may require variation in \nrisering for soundness. (cl different pouring \ntemperatures may require variation in ris\u00ad\nering for soundness. \nNoTE 1 - Test Coupons for Large and Heavy Steel Castings: The test coupons in Fig. 1 are to be used for large and heavy steel castings. \nHowever, at the option of the foundry the cross-sectional area and length of the standard coupon may be increased as desired. \nNOTE 2 - Bend Specimen: If a bend specimen is required, an alternate design (as shown by dotted lines in Fig. 1) is indicated. \n1255 ",
