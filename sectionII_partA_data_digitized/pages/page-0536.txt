SA-333/SA-333M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless and Welded Steel Pipe for Low-Temperature 
Service and Other Applications with Required Notch 
Toughness 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers nominal (average) wall seam­
less and welded carbon and alloy steel pipe intended for use at 
low temperatures and in other applications requiting notch 
toughness. Several grades of fenitic steel are included as listed 
in Table l . Some product sizes may not be available under this 
specification because heavier wall thicknesses have an adverse 
effect on impact properties. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
NoTE 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diaineter," "size," and "nominal size."
