Scope \n1.1 This specification covers alloy and stainless steel bolt\u00ad\ning materials and bolting components for pressure vessels, \nvalves, flanges, and fittings for low-temperature service. See \nSpecification A962/ A962M for the definition of bolting. The \nbars shall be hot-wrought and may be further processed by \ncenterless grinding or by cold drawing. Austenitic stainless \nsteel may be solution annealed or annealed and strain\u00ad\nhardened. When strain hardened austenitic stainless steel is \nordered, the purchaser should take special care to ensure that \nAppendix Xl is thoroughly understood. \n1.2 Several grades are covered, including both ferritic and \naustenitic steels designated L7, B8, etc. Selection will depend \non design, service conditions, mechanical properties, and \nlow-temperature characteristics. The mechanical requirements \nof Table 1 indicate the diameters for which the minimum \nmechanical properties apply to the various grades and classes, \nand Table 2 stipulates the requirements for Charpy impact \nenergy absorption. The manufacturer should determine that the \nmaterial can conform to these requirements before parts are \nmanufactured. For example, when Grade L43 is specified to \nmeet the Table 2 impact energy values at -150 \u00b0F [-101 \u00b0C], \nadditional restrictions (such as procuring a steel with lower P \nand S contents than might normally be supplied) in the \nchemical composition for AISI 4340 are likely to be required. \nNoTE 1-The committee formulating this specification has included \nseveral grades of material that have been rather extensively used for the \npresent purpose. Other compositions will be considered for inclusion by \nthe committee from time to time as the need becomes apparent. Users \nshould note that hardenability of some of the grades mentioned may \nrestrict the maximum size at which the required mechanical properties are \nobtainable. \n1.3 The following referenced general requirements are in\u00ad\ndispensable for application of this specification: Specification \nA962/A962M. \n1.4 Nuts for use with bolting are covered in Section 10 and \nthe nut material shall be impact tested. \n1.5 Supplementary Requirements are provided for use at the \noption of the purchaser. The supplementary requirements shall \napply only when specified in the purchase order or contract. \ni.6 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units \nand SI units; however, unless the purchase order or contract \nspecifies the applicable M specification designation (SI) units, \nthe inch-pound units shall apply. \n1.7 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n1.8 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n466 \n2.
