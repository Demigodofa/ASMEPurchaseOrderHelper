The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm]. \nMicrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements. \nNOTE 4-This table was used to construct Table Al.12 by multiplying the values in this table by 0.50 and rounding to 2 decimal places using standard \nASTM practice. \nNOTE 5-The thickness of material <25-mm wide shall be measured at mid-width. \nSpecified Width, mm \nOver Through \n1800 \n2000 \n1800 \n2000 \nD \nThrough 0.4 \n0.10 \nD \nD \nSpecified Ordered Thickness, mm 8 \nOver 0.4 to 1.0, Incl Over 1.0 to 1.2, incl Over 1.2 to 2.5, incl Over 2.5 to 4.0, Incl \nThickness Tolerances Over, mm, No Tolerance Under 0 \n0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 \n0.15 0.20 0.30 0.35 \n0.30 0.30 0.35 0.40 \nA 0.55-mm minimum thickness for high-strength low-alloy. \n8 The specified thickness range captions apply independent of whether the ordered thickness is stated as a nominal or minimum. \n0 The tolerances provided in the table are based on minimum thickness (tolerance over, no tolerance under). For nominal thickness, the tolerance Is divided equally over \nand under. \n0 Where an ellipsis ( ... ) appears in the table, the requirements have not been defined. \nANNEX \n(Mandatory Information) \nAl. PERMISSIBLE VARIATIONS IN DIMENSIONS AND MASS IN SI UNITS \nListed in Tables Al.l-Al.17 are permissible variations in dimensions and mass expressed in the International System of Units (SI) \nterminology. \nTABLE A1.1 Thickness Tolerances [Metric] for Hot-Rolled Sheet \n(Carbon and Structural Steel Only)-15-mm (Cut Edge) and \n25-mm (Mill Edge) Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut \nLengths, Including Pickled) \nNoTE I-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less \nthan 15 mm from a cut edge and not less than 25 mm from a mill edge. \nThis table does not apply to the uncropped ends of mill edge coils. \nNOTE 2-Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be \nconstructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of \n0.188 in.
