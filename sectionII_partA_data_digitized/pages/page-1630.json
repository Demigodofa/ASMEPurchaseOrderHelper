Additional Requirements \n1.1 General Requirements: \nAll \"see EN 10028-1\" shall be read as \"shall be according \nto EN 10028-1.\" \n1.2 Marking: \n(a) In addition to the marking requirements of this \nspecification, all products required to be marked and \nmaterial identification used on all documentation \nrequired by this specification are to be identified by \nthis SA/EN specification designation. \n(b) Plates that have been given the full heat treatment \nrequired by para. 8.2.1 or 8.2.2 shall be marked by the \nparty performing the heat treatment with the letters \ndesignating the applicable heat treatment condition in \nTable 4 of EN 10028-3 following the stamped steel \nname or number. \n(c) Plates for which normalizing has been replaced by \nnormalizing rolling as permitted by para. 8.2.2 shall be \nmarked \"+NR\" instead of \"+N.\" \n( d) Plates that are not heat treated but are qualified on \nthe basis of heat treated specimens per para. 8.2.3 shall be \nstamped with letter \"G\" following the stamped specifica\u00ad\ntion designation. \n(e) When such plates are subsequently heat treated, \nthey shall be marked, by the party that performed the \nheat treatment, as required by (b) above following the \nrequired stamped specification designation. \n1.3 Chemical Composition: \nThe requirements of paras. 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 on heat \nanalysis, and of paras. 7.2.3 and 7.2.4 on product analysis, \nof SA-20/SA-20M shall apply. In addition, the copper \ncontent shall be per SA-20/SA-20M Table 1. \n1.4 Impact Test Sampling: \nDeviation from the requirement for preparation of test \npieces for impact testing in EN 10028-1 shall not be \npermitted in SA/EN 10028-3. \n1.5 Steelmaking Process: \nThe ratio of reduction of thickness from a strand-cast \nslab to plate shall be at least 3.0:1. \n1.6 Quality: \nAll surface imperfections, the removal of which will \nreduce the plate thickness below its permissible \nminimum, shall be cause for rejection of the plate; \nhowever by agreement with the purchaser, the metal \nso removed may be replaced with weld metal. \nPreparation for repair welding shall include inspection \nto assure complete removal of the defect. \nRepairs shall be made utilizing welding procedures \nqualified in accordance with ASME Section IX and \nrepair welding shall be done by welders or welding opera\u00ad\ntors meeting the qualification requirements of ASME \nSection IX. \n1.7 Test Reports: \n1.7,l The designation of this SA/EN specification \nshall include the edition year. \n1.7.2 Copies of the original manufacturer's test \nreport shall be included with any subsequent test report. \n2. National Parts \n2.1 The National Foreword and the National Annexes, \nif any, do not apply for SA/EN 10028-3. \n3.
