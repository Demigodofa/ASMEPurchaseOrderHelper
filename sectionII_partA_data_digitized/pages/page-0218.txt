Note-The above table gives the computed minimum elongation values for 
each V.2-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. Where the wall thickness lies 
between two values shown above, the minimum elongation value is determined by 
the following equation: 
E = 48T+ 15.00 
where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm, %, and 
T = actual thickness of specimen, in. 
this positioning, the test specimen shall be positioned as near as 
possible to the prescribed location. 
8.3 Tension Tests: 
8.3.1 One tension test shall be made for each heat of 
as-forged components. 
8.3.2 One tension test shall be made from each heat-treating 
charge. If more than one heat is included in such a charge, each 
heat shall be tested. 
8.3.2.1 When forgings of different shapes are included in the 
same heat-treating charge, the test specimen shall be obtained 
from the heaviest cross-section of the thickest forging, except 
for hubbed flanges (see 8.3.3). The test specimen shall repre­
sent all forgings from the same heat and heat-treating charge 
whose maximum thicknesses do not exceed the thickness of the 
test forging. 
8.3.2.2 When the heat-treating temperatures are the same 
and the furnaces (either batch or continuous type), are con­
trolled within ±25 °F [±14 °C] and equipped with recording 
pyrometers so that complete records of heat treatment are 
available, then one tension test from each heat is required 
instead of one test from each heat in each heat-treatment 
charge. The test specimen material shall be included with a 
furnace charge. 
8.3.3 Testing shall be performed as specified in Specifica­
tion A961/A961M. The largest feasible round specimen shall 
be used except when hollow cylindrically shaped parts are 
machined from seamless tubulars, When hollow cylindrically 
shaped parts are machined from seamless tubular materials, 
strip tests may be used. The tension test specimen shall be 
obtained from a production forging, or from an integral 
prolongation representative of the hub location of a flange, or 
the heaviest cross section of a fitting, valve, or other part within 
the scope of this specification. 
8.3.4 Forgings too small to permit obtaining a subsize 
specimen of 0.250 in. [6.35 mm] diameter or larger parallel to 
the dimension of maximum working, and produced in equip­
ment unsuitable for the production of a separately forged test 
bar such as an automatic or semi-automatic press, may be 
accepted on the basis of hardness only. One percent of the 
forgings per lot, where a lot is the product from a heat, or, if 
heat treated, the product of a heat per furnace charge, or ten 
forgings, whichever is the lesser number, shall be selected at 
random, prepared, and tested using the standard Brinell test. 
The locations of the indentations shall be at the option of the 
manufacturer but shall be selected to be representative of the 
forging as a whole. One indentation per forging shall be 
required but additional indentations may be made to establish 
the representative hardness. The hardness of all forgings so 
tested shall be 137 to 197 HBW inclusive. 
8.4 Hardness Tests: 
8.4.1 Two hardness tests shall be made for each heat of 
as-forged components. When more than one forging is pro­
duced from each heat, a minimum of two forgings shall be 
tested with one reading from each forging. When only one 
forging is produced, it shall be tested in two locations. 
8.4.2 Except when only one forging is produced, a mini­
mum of two forgings shall be hardness tested per batch or 
continuous run as defined in 8.3.2.2 to ensure that forgings are 
within the hardness limits given in Table 2. When only one 
forging is produced, it shall be hardness tested in two locations 
to ensure it is within the hardness limits given in Table 2. 
166 
8.4.3 Testing shall be as specified in Specification A961/ 
A961M. The purchaser may verify that the requirement has 
been met by testing at any location on the forging, provided 
such testing does not render the forging useless. 
9. Hydrostatic Tests 
9.1 Such tests shall be conducted by the forging manufac­
turer only when Supplementary Requirement S57 in Specifi­
cation A961/A961M is specified. 
10. Retreatment 
10.1 If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform to 
the requirement specified, the manufacturer may heat treat or 
reheat treat the forgings as applicable and repeat the test 
specified in Section 8.
