A The carbon ranges shown in the column headed "Range" apply when the 
specified maximum limit for manganese does not exceed 1.1 0 %. When the 
maximum manganese limit exceeds 1.1 0 %, add 0.01 to the carbon ranges shown 
above. 
8 For steels produced in merchant quality the phosphorus maximum is 0.04 % and 
the sulfur maximum is 0.05 %. 
c It is not common practice to produce a rephosphorized and resulfurized carbon 
steel to specified limits for silicon because of its adverse effect on machinability. 
0 A cast or heat analysis is not determinable when lead is added to the ladle 
stream.

6. Mechanical Property Requirements 
6.1 Test Specimens: 
6.1.1 Selection-Test specimens shall be selected in accor­
dance with the requirements of the applicable product specifi­
cation or in accordance with Supplement I of the latest issue of 
Test Methods and Definitions A370, in the sequence named. 
6.1.2 Preparation-Unless otherwise specified in the appli­
cable product specification, test specimens shall be prepared in 
accordance w1th the latest issue of Test Methods and Defini­
tions A370, and especially Supplement I thereof. 
6.2 Methods of Mechanical Testing-All mechanical tests 
shall be conducted in accordance with the latest issue of Test 
Methods and Definitions A370, and especially Supplement I 
thereof, on steel bar products. 
6.3 Retests: 
6.3.1 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws, the specimen may be discarded and another 
substituted. 
6.3.2 If the percentage elongation of any tension specimen 
is less than that specified and any part of the fracture is more 
than ¾ in. [20 mm] from the center of a 2 in. [50 mm] 
specimen, or is outside the middle half of the gage length of an 
8 in. [200 mm] specimen as indicated by scribe scratches 
marked on the specimen before testing, a retest shall be 
allowed. 
6.3.3 For "as-wrought" material, if the results for any 
original tension specimen are within 2000 psi [14 MPa] of the 
required tensile strength, within 1000 psi [7 MPa] of the 
required yield point, or within 2 % of the required elongation, 
retesting shall be permitted. If the original testing required only 
one test, the retest shall consist of two random tests from the 
heat or lot involved. If the original testing required two tests of 
which one failed by the amounts listed in this paragraph, the 
retest shall be made on one random test from the heat or lot. If 
the results on the retest specimen or specimens meet the 
specified requirements, the heat or test lot will be accepted. If 
the results of one retest specimen do not meet the specified 
requirements, the material is subject to rejection. 
6.3.4 For thermally treated bars, if the results of the me­
chanical tests do not conform to the requirements specified, 
two more tests may be selected for each bar failing, and each 
of these retests shall conform to the requirements of the 
product specification. 
6.3.5 If a bend specimen fails, due to conditions of bending 
more severe than required by the specification, a retest shall be 
permitted from the heat or test lot involved for which one 
random specimen for each original specimen showing failure 
shall be used. If the results on the retest specimen meet the 
requirements of the specification, the heat or test lot will be 
accepted. 
7. Dimensions, Mass, and Permissible Variations 
7 .1 Hot-Wrought Bars-The permissible variations for di­
mensions of hot-wrought carbon and alloy steel bars shall not 
exceed the applicable limits stated in Annex Al for inch-pound 
values and Annex A2 for metric values. 
8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
8.1 The material shall be free of injurious defects and shall 
have a workmanlike finish. 
9. Rework and Retreatment 
109 
9.1 For thermally treated bars only, the manufacturer may 
retreat a lot one or more times, and retests shall be made in the 
same manner as the original tests. Each such retest shall 
conform to the requirements specified. 
10. Inspection 
10.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry, at all times while work on the contract of the purchaser
