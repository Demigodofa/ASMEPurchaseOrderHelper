INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Forged Steel Rolls Used for Corrugating Paper Machinery 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A649/ A649M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification 2 covers two kinds of rolls used in 
machinery for producing corrugated paperboard. Rolls are 
fabricated of forged bodies and trunnions. The trunnions may 
be bolted or shrink assembled on one or both ends of the body. 
A seal weld may be made at the body/trunnion interface. Roll 
shells are made of carbon/manganese, or low alloy steel as 
hereinafter described, and are heat treated prior to assembly. 
Pressure rolls may be ordered surface hardened as Condition 
H, or without surface hardening as Condition S. Provision is 
made in Supplementary Requirements S 1 and S3 for the 
optional surface hardening of corrugating rolls. 
1.2 Corrugating and pressure rolls made to this specification 
shall not exceed 30 in. [760 mm] in inside diameter. The wall 
thickness of the roll body shall not be less than 1/12 of the inside 
diameter or 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is greater, but shall not 
exceed 4 in. [100 mm]. The wall thickness of the corrugating 
roll is measured at the bottom of the corrugations in the 
location of the trunnion fit. The maximum design temperature 
(MDT) of the roll is 600 °F [315 °C] and the maximum 
allowable working pressure (MAWP) is 250 psi [1.7 MPa]. The 
minimum design temperature shall be 40 °F [4 °C] for roll wall 
thicknesses up to 3 in. [75 mm]. For roll wall thicknesses over 
3 in. [75 mm] to 4 in. [100 mm], the minimum design 
temperature shall be 120 °F [50 °C]. The maximum stresses on 
the roll bodies from the combined internal and external loading 
are limited to 18 750 psi [129 MPa] for the Class 2 pressure 
roll bodies, and 20 000 psi [138 MPa] for Class lA, lB, or 5 
pressure or corrugating roll bodies in Grades 1 or 2. For the 
trunnions, the maximum stresses from the combined internal 
and external loading are limited to 15 000 psi [103.4 MPa] for 
Classes 3 or 4, or 20 000 psi [138 MPa] for Classes IA, lB, or 
5 in Grade 2 only. The Grade 1 strength level is not pennissible 
for trunnions. 
1.3 Referring to Table 1, material to Classes lA, lB, or 5 
shall be used for the manufacture of corrugating or pressure

roll shells, and Class 2 shall be used only for pressure roll 
shells. Trunnions shall be made from forgings in Classes lA, 
lB, or 5 in Grade 2 strength level as restricted by Footnote B 
in Table 2 or in forgings in either Class 3 or 4. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other, and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined. 
1.5 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch­
pound units. 
1.6 Except as specifically required in this standard, all of the 
provisions of Specification A788/A788M apply. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
