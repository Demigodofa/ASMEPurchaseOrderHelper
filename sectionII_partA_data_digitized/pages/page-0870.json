Scope \n1.1 This specification covers ductile iron castings for \nuse in pressure containing paper mill dryer rolls at tempera\u00ad\ntures up to 450\u00b0F [230\u00b0C]. \n1.2 No precise quantitative relationship can be stated \nbetween the properties of the iron in various locations of \nthe same casting or between the properties of a casting \nand those of a test specimen cast from the same iron (see \nAppendix Xl). \n1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \nunits are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the \ntext, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated \nin each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in nonconformance \nwith the specification. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA 644 Terminology Relating to Iron Castings \nE 8 Test Methods for Tension Testing of Metallic Materials \nE 10 Test Method for Brinell Hardness of Metallic Mate-\nrials \nE 94 Guide for Radiographic Testing \nE 446 Reference Radiographs for Steel Castings Up to 2 \nin. (51 mm) in Thickness \n3. Terminology \n3.1 Definitions for many terms common to iron castings \nare found in Terminology A 644. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 Orders for material purchased to the requirements of \nthis specification should include the following information: \n768 \n4.1.1 Quantity, \n4.1.2 Specification number and date of issue, \n4.1.3 Description of casting by pattern number or \ndrawing, \n4.1.4 Heat treatment, if required (see 5.1), \n4.1.5 Type of test coupon (see 9.2), \n4.1.6 Certification, is required (see 13.1), \n4.1.7 Marking location (see 14.1), and \n4.1.8 Additional requirements. \n5. Heat Treatment \n5.1 The castings may be stress relieved at a temperature \nnot to exceed 1200\u00b0F [650\u00b0C]. \n6. Chemical Requirements \n6.1 The castings shall conform to the following chemi\u00ad\ncal requirements: \nTotal carbon, min, % \nSilicon, max, % \nPhosphorus, max, % \nSulfur, max,% \n3.0 \n3.0 \n0.08 \n0.05 \n6.2 The castings shall have a carbon equivalent of 3.8 \nto 4.5 inclusive. \nNOTE 1 - The carbon content equivalent is calculated as follows: \nTotal carbon + 0.3 (silicon + phosphorus) \n6.3 The chemical analysis for total carbon shall be \nmade on either chilled cast pencil-type specimens or on \nthin wafers approximately \u00bd 2 in. [0.8 mm] thick, cut from \ntest coupons. Drillings shall not be used due to attendant \nloss of graphite. \n,\u00b7,,-----....._,-",
