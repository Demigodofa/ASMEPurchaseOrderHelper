Each individual test value of the retested \nspecimens shall be equal to or greater than the specified \nminimum average value. \n24.2 Test Specifying a Minimum Transition Temperature: \n24.2.1 Definition of Transition Temperature-For specifica\u00ad\ntion purposes, the transition temperature is the temperature at \nwhich the designated material test value equals or exceeds a \nspecified minimum test value. \n24.2.2 Determination of Transition Temperature: \n24.2.2.4 Accept the test result if the determined transition \ntemperature is equal to or lower than the specified value. \n24.2.2.5 If the determined transition temperature is higher \nthan the specified value, but not more than 12 \u00b0C higher than \nthe specified value, test sufficient samples in accordance with \nSection 25 to plot two additional curves. Accept the test results \nif the temperatures determined from both additional tests are \nequal to or lower than the specified value. \n24.3 When subsize specimens are permitted or necessary, or \nboth, modify the specified test requirement according to Table \n7 or test temperature according to codes such as ASME Boiler \nand Pressure Vessel Code, Section Vill, Division I Table UG-\n84.2, or both. Greater energies or lower test temperatures may \nbe agreed upon by purchaser and supplier. \n25. Records \n25.1 The test record should contain the following informa\u00ad\ntion as appropriate: \n25.1.1 Full description of material tested (that is, specifica\u00ad\ntion number, grade, class or type, size, heat number). \n25.1.2 Specimen orientation with respect to the material \naxis. \nTABLE 7 Charpy V-Notch Test Acceptance Criteria for Various Sub-Size Specimens described by Test Methods E23 \nFull Size %Size %Size \n10 by 10 mm 10 by 7.5 mm 10 by 6.7 mm \nJ J J \n54 41 37 \n48 35 31 \n41 30 27 \n34 26 23 \n27 20 18 \n22 16 15 \n20 15 14 \n18 14 12 \n16 12 11 \n14 11 10 \n10 7 7 \n24.2.2.1 Break one specimen at each of a series of tempera\u00ad\ntures above and below the anticipated transition temperature \nusing the procedures in Section 23. Record each test tempera\u00ad\nture to the nearest 0.5 \u00b0C. \n24.2.2.2 Plot the individual test results (J or percent shear) \nas the ordinate versus the corresponding test temperature as the \nabscissa and construct a best-fit curve through the plotted data \npoints. \n24.2.2.3 If transition temperature is specified as the tem\u00ad\nperature at which a test value is achieved, determine the \ntemperature at which the plotted curve intersects the specified \ntest value by graphical interpolation ( extrapolation is not \npermitted). Record this transition temperature to the nearest \n3 \u00b0C. If the tabulated test results clearly indicate a transition \ntemperature lower than specified, it is not necessary to plot the \ndata.
