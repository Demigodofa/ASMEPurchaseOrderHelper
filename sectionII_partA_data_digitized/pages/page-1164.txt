SA-660 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Centrifugally Cast Carbon Steel Pipe for High-Temperature 
Service 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers carbon steel pipe made by the 
centrifugal casting process intended for use in high­
temperature, high-pressure service. Pipe ordered under this 
specification shall be suitable for fusion welding, bending, and 
other forming operations. 
1.2 Several grades of carbon steels are covered. Their 
compositions are given in Table 1. 
1.3 Supplementary requirements (Sl to S9) of an optional 
nature are provided. The supplementary requirements call for 
additional tests to be made, and when desired shall be so stated 
in the order, together with the number of such tests required. 
1.4 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as the standard.
