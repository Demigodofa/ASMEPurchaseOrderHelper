4. Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and 
shall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of 
Specification A20/ A20M. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 All plates shall be heat treated in accordance with 5.2. 
Shell plates and other parts, including heads and reinforcing 
pads, which are heated for forming, shall be heat treated after 
5.2.2.1 Prior to the tempering tTeatment, the plates may be 
subjected to an intermediate heat treatment consisting of 
heating to a temperature in the range from 1165 to 1290°F [630 
to 700°C] for Type I, or 1185 to 1310°F [640 to 710°C] for 
Type II, or 1205 to 1330°F [650 to 720°C] for Type III; holding 
at that temperature for a suitable time, but in no case less than 
15 min, and then water-quenching to below 300°F [150°C] in 
the case of plate thicknesses of more than 5 /s in. [16 mm] or 
cooling in air or water-quenching to below 300°F [150°C] in 
the case of plate thicknesses of 5/s in. [16 mm] and under. 
NoTE 1-The intermediate heat treatment is for the purpose of 
enhancing elongation and notch-toughness and for reducing susceptibility 
to strain-aging embrittlement and temper embrittlement. It may be 
performed at the option of the material manufacturer or may be specified 
by the purchaser. 
6. Chemical Requirements

of thickness but not less than 15 min, and cool in air or water 
quench at a rate not less than 300°F/h [165°C/h]. 
5.2.1 Hardening-The plates shall be heated to a tempera­
ture within the range from 1475 to 1700°F [800 to 925°C], held 
at that temperature for a sufficient time to obtain uniform 
temperature throughout the plate thickness, and then quenched 
in a liquid media. 
5.2.2 Tempe1ing-The plates shall be tempered at a tem­
perature within the range from 1050 to ll 75°F [565 to 635°C] 
for Type I and Type II, or from 1000 to 1125°F [540 to 615°C] 
for Type III; being held at that temperature for a minimum of 
30 min/in. [1.2 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 
15 min, and then cooled in air or liquid-quenched at a rate not 
less than 300°F/h [165°C/h].

7.1.1 Upon agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer, yield strength may be determined by the exten­
sion under load method, using 0.005 in.fin. [mm/mm] total 
extension. 
7.1.2 For nominal plate thicknesses of¾ in. [20 mm] and 
under, the 1 ½ in. [40 mm] wide rectangular specimen may be 
used for the tension test and the elongation may be determined 
in a 2 in. [50 mm] gage length that includes the fracture and 
shows the greatest elongation.

7.2 Impact Test Requirements: 
7.2.1 Charpy V-notch impact tests shall be made in accor­
dance with Specification A20/ A20M. 
7.2.2 The longitudinal axis of the test specimens shall be 
transverse to the final rolling direction of the plate.
