The preferred method of measur\u00ad\ning the length shall be between conical centers machined on the \ncenter line of the bolt, with mating centers on the measuring \nanvils. The head or body of the bolt shall be marked so that it \ncan be placed in the same position for all measurements. The \nbolt shall be assembled in the testing equipment as outlined in \nA3.2.1.4, and the proof load specified in the product specifi\u00ad\ncation shall be applied. Upon release of this load the length of \nthe bolt shall be again measured and shall show no permanent \nelongation. A tolerance of :t0.0005 in. (0.0127 mm) shall be \nallowed between the measurement made before loading and \nthat made after loading. Variables, such as straightness and \nthread alignment (plus measurement e1rnr), may result in \napparent elongation of the fasteners when the proof load is \ninitially applied. In such cases, the fastener may be retested \nusing a 3 % greater load, and may be considered satisfactory if \nthe length after this loading is the same as before this loading \n(within the 0.0005-in. tolerance for measurement error). \nA3.2. l .3 Proof Load-Time of Loading-The proof load is to \nbe maintained for a period of 10 s before release of load, when \nusing Method 1. \n(1) Method 2, Yield Strength-The bolt shall be assembled \nin the testing equipment as outlined in A3.2.l.4. As the load is \napplied, tl1e total elongation of the bolt or any part of the bolt \nwhich includes the exposed six threads shall be measured and \nrecorded to produce a load-strain or a stress-strain diagram. \nThe load or stress at an offset equal to 0.2 % of the length of \nbolt occupied by six full threads shall be determined by the \nmethod described in 14.2.1 of these methods, A370. This load \nor stress shall not be less than that prescribed in the product \nspecification. \nA3.2.l.4 Axial Tension Testing of Full Size Bolts-Bolts \nare to be tested in a holder with the load axially applied \nbetween the head and a nut or suitable fixture (see Fig. A3.l), \neither of which shall have sufficient thread engagement to \nFIG. A3.1 Tension Testing Full-size Bolt \ndevelop the full strength of the bolt. The nut or fixture shall be \nassembled on the bolt leaving six complete bolt threads \nunengaged between the grips, except for heavy hexagon \nstructural bolts which shall have four complete threads unen\u00ad\ngaged between the grips. To meet the requirements of this test, \nthere shall be a tensile failure in the body or threaded section \nwith no failure at the junction of the body and head. When \ntensile testing externally threaded fasteners made of austenitic \nstainless steel and the test fastener's thread pulls out of the \ninternally threaded test fixture after the minimum tensile \nstrength requirement has been reached, the fasteners shall be \nconsidered conforming to the tensile strength requirement and, \nin addition to the tensile strength, the failure mode shall be \nreported to the purchaser. If it is necessary to record or report \nthe tensile strength of bolts as psi values, the stress area shall \nbe calculated from the mean of the mean root and pitch \ndiameters of Class 3 external threads as follows: \nA,= 0.7854 [D - (0.9743/n)] 2 (A3.l) \nwhere: \nAs = stress area, in.2, \nD = nominal diameter, in., and \nn = number of threads per in. \nA3.2.l.5 Tension Testing of Full-size Bolts with a Wedge\u00ad\nThe purpose of this test is to obtain the tensile strength and \ndemonstrate the \"head quality\" and ductility of a bolt with a \nstandard head by subjecting it to eccentric loading. The \nultimate load on the bolt shall be determined as described in \nA3.2.1.4, except that a 10\u00b0 wedge shall be placed under the \nsame bolt previously tested for the proof load (see A3.2.1.1). \nThe bolt head shall be so placed that no comer of the hexagon \nor square takes a bearing load, that is, a flat of the head shall \nbe aligned with the direction of uniform thickness of the wedge \n(see Fig. A3.2). The wedge shall have an included angle \nbetween its faces as shown in Table A3.1 and shall have a \nthickness of one-half of the nominal bolt diameter at the short \nside of the hole. The hole in the wedge shall have the following \nclearance over the nominal size of the bolt, and its edges, top \nand bottom, shall be rounded to the following radius: \nClearance in Hole, Radius on Corners of \nNominal Bolt Size, in. in. (mm) Hole, in. (mm) \n\u00bc to \u00bd 0.030 (0.76) 0.030 (0.76) \n9 /,a to \u00be 0.050 (1.3) 0.060 (1.5) \n7 /s to 1 0.063 (1.5) 0.060 (1.5) \n620 \n11/s to 1\u00bc 0.063 (1.5) 0.125 (3.2) \n13/s to 1\u00bd 0.094 (2.4) 0.125 (3.2) \nA3.2.1.6 Wedge Testing of HT Bolts Threaded to Head-For \nheat-treated bolts that are threaded 1 diameter and closer to the \nunderside of the head, the wedge angle shall be 6\u00b0 for sizes \u00bc \nthrough\u00be in. (6.35 to 19.0 mm) and 4\u00b0 for sizes over\u00be in. \nA3.2.1.7 Tension Testing of Bolts Machined to Round Test \nSpecimens: \n( 1) Bolts under l \u00bd in. (38 mm) in nominal diameter \nwhich require machined tests shall preferably use a standard \n\u00bd-in., (13 mm) round 2-in. (50 mm) gauge length test \nspecimen (see Fig. 4); however, bolts of small cross-section \nthat will not permit the taking of this standard test specimen \nshall use one of the small-size-specimens-proportional-to\u00ad\nstandard (see Fig. 4) and the specimen shall have a reduced \nsection as large as possible.
