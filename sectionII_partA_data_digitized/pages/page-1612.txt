10.3.9 Post-Weld Heat Treatment Requirements for Grade 
C933-All welds shall be heat treated in accordance with one 
of the following requirements, as applicable: 
10.3.9.1 All welds shall be heat treated within the tempera­
ture range of 1350 to 1440 °F [730 to 780 °C], for a minimum 
holding time based on the maximum thickness of the casting. 
10.3.9.2 Local post-weld heat treatment is permitted only by 
agreement between the manufacturer and purchaser. Process 
requirements to ensure that the minimum post-weld heat 
treatment is reached in welds and that the maximum post-weld 
heat treatment is not exceeded anywhere on the casting shall be 
as agreed upon by the manufacturer and purchaser. 
11. Rejection 
11.1 Each casting received from the producer may be 
inspected by the purchaser and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of the specification based on the inspection and 
test methods as outlined in the specification, the casting may be 
rejected and the producer shall be notified. Disposition of 
rejected castings shall be a matter of agreement between the 
producer and the purchaser. 
12. Certification and Marking 
12.1 Certification and marking of castings shall meet the 
certification and marking requirements of Specification A 703/ 
A703M, A985/A985M, or A999/A999M, as applicable, except 
that for centrifugally cast pipe, the certification and marking 
requirements of Specification A999/A999M are mandatory. 
12.2 In addition to the requirements of 12.1, the certification 
shall include the locations of welds as required by 10.3.6 and 
10.3.7. 
12.3 In addition to the requirements of 12.1, the class 
designation (see Table 5) shall be included in the certification 
and marking of the castings.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the purchase order. 
Lists of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser are included 
in Specifications A 703/ A 703M and A985/ A985M. Those that are ordinarily considered suitable for 
use with this specification are given below. Others enumerated in Specifications A703/A703M and 
A985/A985M may be used with this specification upon agreement between the manufacturer and 
purchaser.
