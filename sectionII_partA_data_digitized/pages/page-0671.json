A2.15 Guided-bend Test Jig \nA3. STEEL FASTENERS \nA3.1 Scope \nA3.l.1 This annex contains testing requirements for Steel \nFasteners that are specific to the product. The requirements \ncontained in this annex are supplementary to those found in the \ngeneral section of this specification. In the case of conflict \nbetween requirements provided in this annex and those found \nin the general section of this specification, the requirements of \nthis annex shall prevail. In the case of conflict between \nrequirements provided in this annex and requirements found in \nproduct specifications, the requirements found in the product \nspecification shall prevail. \nA3.l.2 These tests are set up to facilitate production control \ntesting and acceptance testing with certain more precise tests to \nbe used for arbitration in case of disagreement over test results. \nA3.2 Tension Tests \nA3.2.l It is preferred that bolts be tested full size, and it is \ncustomary, when so testing bolts to specify a minimum \nultimate load in pounds, rather than a minimum ultimate \nstrength in pounds per square inch. Three times the bolt \nnominal diameter has been established as the minimum bolt \nlength subject to the tests described in the remainder of this \nsection. Subsections A3.2.l.1 - A3.2.l.6 apply when testing \nbolts full size. Subsection A3.2.l.4 shall apply where the \nindividual product specifications permit the use of machined \nspecimens. \nA3.2.l.1 Proof Load-Due to particular uses of certain \nclasses of bolts it is desirable to be able to stress them, while \nin use, to a specified value without obtaining any permanent \nset. To be certain of obtaining this quality the proof load is \nspecified. The proof load test consists of stressing the bolt with \na specified load which the bolt must withstand without perma\u00ad\nnent set. An alternate test which determines yield strength of a \nfull size bolt is also allowed. Either of the following Methods, \n1 or 2, may be used but Method 1 shall be the arbitration \nmethod in case of any dispute as to acceptance of the bolts. \nA3.2.l.2 Proof Load Testing Long Bolts-When fasteners \nare too long to test in the available equipment they may be cut \nto 8 \u00b1 0.125 in. and tested using Method I. If there is a dispute \nover results when testing the same part or lot of parts both full \nsize and cut to 8 in., the 8 in. test results shall be used to \ndetermine acceptance. \n619 \n(a) Method 1, Length Measurement-The overall length of \na straight bolt shall be measured at its true center line with an \ninstrument capable of measuring changes in length of ",
