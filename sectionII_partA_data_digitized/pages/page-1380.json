  "text": "SA-813/SA-813M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 \n8.1.1 Specified Diameter-The outside diameter shall be \nbased on circumferential measurement and shall not exceed the \ntolerances stated as follows: \n8.1.1.1 For sizes up to and including NPS 1 \u00bc, \u00b10.010 in. \n[\u00b10.25 mm], \n8.1.1.2 For sizes NPS 1 \u00bd up to and including NPS 6, \n\u00b10.020 in. [\u00b10.5 mm], \n8.1.1.3 For sizes NPS 8 up to and including NPS 18, \n\u00b10.030 in. [\u00b10.75 mm], \n8.1.1.4 For sizes NPS 20 up to and including NPS 24, \n\u00b10.040 in. [\u00b1 1 mm], and \n8.1.1.5 For sizes NPS 30, \u00b10.050 in. [\u00b11.25 mm]. \n8.1.1.6 Outside diameter tolerances closer than shown \nabove may be obtained by agreement between the pipe \nmanufacturer and purchaser. \n8.1.2 Out-of-Roundness-The difference.between the major \nand the minor outside diameter shall not be more than 1.5 % of \nthe specified outside diameter. \n8.1.3 Alignment (Camber)-Using a 10-ft [3.0-m] straight\u00ad\nedge placed so that both ends are in contact with the pipe, the \ncamber shall not be more than 3/26 in. [4.8 mm]. \n8.1.4 Thickness-The wall thickness at any point in the pipe \nexcluding the weld, shall not be more than 12 % under or over \nthe nominal thickness for wall thickness less than 0.188 in. \n[4.8 mm] and not more than 0.030 in. [0.8 mm] under or over \nthe nominal thickness for wall thickness 0.188 in. [4.8 mm] \nand greater. Weld reinforcement not to exceed 20 % of the wall \nthickness is permitted on each of the inside and outside \nsurfaces of the pipe. \n9. Lengths \n9.1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following \nregular practice: \n9.1.1 Unless otherwise agreed upon, all sizes up to and \nincluding NPS 8 are available in a length up to 24 ft (Note 2) \nwith the permissible range of 15 to 24 ft (Note 2). Short lengths \nare acceptable and the number and minimum length shall be \nagreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. \nNoTE 2-The value(s) applies when the inch-pound designation of this \nspecification is the basis of purchase. When the \"M\" designation of this \nspecification is the basis of purchase, the corresponding metric value( s) \nshall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. \n9.1.2 If definite cut lengths are desired, the lengths required \nshall be specified in the order. No pipe shall be under the \nspecified length and not more than \u00bc in. [6 mm] over that \nspecified. \n10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n10.1 The finished pipes shall be free of injurious imperfec\u00ad\ntions and shall have a workmanlike finish. Minor imperfections \nmay be removed by grinding, provided the wall thicknesses are \nnot decreased to less than that permitted in Section 8. \n11. Examination of Double-Welded Pipe \n11.1 Both ends of each double-welded (Class DW) pipe \nshall be visually examined to determine that complete fusion \nwas attained between the two welds. In lieu of examining the \nends of the pipe, this examination may be performed on \ncropped ends removed from both ends of each double welded \npipe. \n12. Mechanical Tests Required \n12.l Transverse or Longitudinal Tension Test-One tension \ntest shall be made on a specimen for lots of not more than 100 \npipes. Tension tests shall be made on specimens from two tubes \nfor lots of more than 100 pipes. Pipe size greater than NPS 6 \nshall be tested using the transverse tension test with the weld \ncentered in the gauge length of the test specimen. Test \nspecimens shall be taken from the pipe or test plates of the \nsanie material as the pipe, the test plates being attached to the \nend of the cylinder and welded as prolongation of the pipe \nlongitudinal weld seam. \nNoTE 3-The term lot, for mechanical tests, applies to all pipe of the \nsame nominal size and wall thickness (or schedule) which is produced \nfrom the same heat of steel and subjected to the same finishing treatment: \n(J) in a continuous heat-treatment furnace, or (2) in a batch-type \nheat-treatment furnace, equipped with recording pyrometers and automati\u00ad\ncally controlled within a 50 \u00b0F [30 \u00b0C] range, the larger of: (a) each 200 \nft [60 m] or fraction thereof or (b) that pipe heat treated in the same batch \nfurnace charge. \n12.2 Flattening Test-For material heat treated in a batch\u00ad\ntype furnace, flattening tests shall be made on 5 % of the pipe \nfrom each heat-treated lot. For material heat treated by the \ncontinuous process, this test shall be made on a sufficient \nnumber of pipe to constitute 5 % of the lot, but in no case less \nthan two lengths of pipe. \n12.2.1 For pipe where the diameter equals or exceeds NPS \n10, a transverse-guided face bend test of the weld may be \nconducted instead of a flattening test in accordance with the \nmethod outlined in the steel tubular product supplement of Test \nMethods and Definitions A370. The ductility of the weld shall \nbe considered acceptable when there is no evidence of cracks \nin the weld or between the weld and the base metal after \nbending. Test specimens from 5 % of the lot shall be taken \nfrom the pipe or test plates of the same material as the pipe, the \ntest plates being attached to the end of the cylinder and welded \nas a prolongati~n of the pipe longitudinal seam. \n13. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test \n13.1 Each pipe shall be subjected to the nondestructive \nelectric test or the hydrostatic test. The type of test to be used \nshall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise \nspecified in the purchase order. \n13.2 The hydrostatic test shall be in accordance with Speci\u00ad\nfication A999/ A999M. \n13.3 Nondestructive Examination-Each pipe shall be ex\u00ad\namined with a nondestructive test in accordance with Practice \nE213, or E426. Unless specifically called out by the purchaser, \nthe selection of the nondestructive electric test will be at the \noption of the manufacturer. The range of pipe sizes that may be \nexamined by each method shall be subject to the limitations in \nthe scope of the respective practices. \n13.3.l The following information is for the benefit of the \nuser of this specification: \n1318 ",
