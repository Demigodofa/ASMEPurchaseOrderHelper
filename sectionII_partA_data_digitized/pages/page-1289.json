Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 The steel shall be made by the electric furnace \nprocess with or without separate refining such as argon\u00ad\noxygen decarburization (AOD). \n5.2 Heat Treatment- Castings may be given a homoge\u00ad\nnization heat treatment in accordance with 5.2.1 at the \nproducer's option or when specified by the purchaser (see \nS26) prior to solution heat treatment. All castings, whether \nhomogenized or not, shall be given a solution treatment \nin accordance with 5.2.2 and unless ordered in the solution\u00ad\nannealed condition shall be precipitation hardened to the \nordered condition (Table 2). \n5.2.1 Homogenization heat treatment shall consist \nof heating the castings and test material to a minimum of \n1900\u00b0F [1040\u00b0], holding for a minimum of 11/z h, and \ncooling to below 90\u00b0F [30\u00b0C]. \n5.2.2 Solution annealing heat treatment shall consist \nof heating the castings and test material to 1925\u00b0F \u00b1 50\u00b0F \n[1050\u00b0C \u00b1 30\u00b0C], holding the 30 min/in. [1.2 min/mm] of \nsection but not less than 30 min, and cooling to below \n90\u00b0F [30\u00b0C]. \n5.2.3 Temperature used for precipitation hardening \nshall be maintained within the range of\u00b1 25\u00b0F [\u00b1 l5\u00b0C] \nof that listed in Table 2 for the heat-treatment condition \nordered. (See Note 1). \n5.2.4 When the order of contract specifies a mini\u00ad\nmum columbium content, the minimum precipitation hard\u00ad\nening temperature shall be 925\u00b0F [495\u00b0C]. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall be in accordance with the require\u00ad\nments as to chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. \n6.2 When the H900 condition is ordered, the minimum \ncolumbium content (Table 1) shall not apply. It is recom\u00ad\nmended that columbium other than that in revert material \nnot be added. \n6.3 Methods of Analysis - Analytical procedures for \nnitrogen analysis are not included in Methods E 38 or Test \nMethods E 353, so if the contract or order specifies that \nthe nitrogen content is to be reported, the method of analy\u00ad\nsis shall be agreed upon by purchaser and producer. \n7. Repair by Welding \n7.1 Repairs shall be made only in one of the following \nconditions: homogenized, solution annealed, Hl 100, \nHl 150, Hl 150M, Hl 150DBL, or stress relieved at 1150\u00b0F \n\u00b1 25\u00b0F [620\u00b0C \u00b1 15\u00b0C] for a minimum of 4 h. \n7 .2 Castings welded in one of the aged conditions noted \nin 7 .1 shall be post weld heat treated by the same aging \ntreatment used prior to welding, or, where necessary to \nmeet mechanical property requirements, shall be solution \nannealed and aged after welding. Castings welded in the \nstress-relieved condition shall receive the specification heat \ntreatment after welding. \n8.
