A Intentional additions of Cr, Mo, and Ni up to the specified maximum are permitted 
to be made to Grades I, 11, and IV by the manufacturer. 
3.4 If steel is required to be vacuum degassed, Supplemen­
tary Requirement S8 of Specification A788/A788M should be 
specified. 
4. Heat Treatment for Mechanical Properties 
4.1 Heat treatment shall consist of one of the following heat 
treatment options of the manufacturer's choice. 
4.1.1 Normalize and temper. 
4.1.2 Double normalize, wherein the second austenitizing 
temperature is at the same or lower temperature than the first, 
followed by tempering. 
4.1.3 Quench and temper, with the option of adding a 
preliminary normalize before austenitizing for quenching in a 
suitable liquid medium. The type of cooling medium used shall 
be reported. 
4.1.4 Use of an intercritical heat treatment cycle in accor­
dance with Specification A788/A788M in which cooling from 
the full and partial austenitization stages may be done by liquid 
quenching or air cooling. The method of cooling and type of 
quench medium, if used, shall be reported. 
4.1.5 The minimum tempering temperature shall be 1100°F 
[590°C]. 
5. Chemical Requirements 
5.1 Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam­
pling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall 
comply with Table 1. 
5.2 Product Analysis-The purchaser may use the product 
analysis provision of Specification A788/A788M to obtain a 
product analysis from a forging representing each heat or 
multiple heat. 
6. Mechanical Requirements 
6.1 General Requirements-The forgings shall conform to 
the tension test requirements of Table 2. The forgings shall also 
conform to the impact test requirements of Table 3. The largest 
obtainable round tension test specimen as specified in Test 
Methods and Definitions A370 shall be used. Impact speci­
mens shall be Charpy V-notch, Type A, as in Test Methods and 
Definitions A370. The usage of subsize impact specimens must 
have prior purchaser approval. 
6.1.1 When agreed upon between the purchaser and the 
producer and specified on the order, impact tests may be made 
at temperatures different from those shown in Table 3 provided 
the test temperature is at least as low as the intended service 
temperatures and the provided impact energy requirements of 
Table 3 are met. Such forgings shall be suitably marked in 
accordance with 9.1 to identify the test temperature. 
6.2 Test Location-Test coupons shall be taken so that the 
longitudinal axis and mid-length of tension and impact test 
specimens shall be positioned in accordance with one of the 
following methods: 
6.2.1 Method I-Forgings with 2 in. [50 mm] maximum 
thickness. The specimens shall have their longitudinal axis at 
the midthickness or the center of the cross section and with the 
midlength of the specimen at least 2 in. [50 mm] from any 
second surface. 
6.2.2 Method 2-Grade I and Grade II forgings with thick­
nesses greater than 2 in. up to 4 in. [50 to 100 mm] inclusive, 
or Grade III and IV forgings with thicknesses greater than 2 in. 
up to 6 in. [50 to 150 mm] inclusive. The specimens shall have 
their longitudinal axis at least ¼ T of maximum heat-treated 
thickness from any surface and with the midlength of the 
specimen at least one T from any second surface. This is 
normally referred to as ¼ T by T when T is the maximum 
heat-treated thickness. A thermal buffer may be used to adhere 
to the condition in 6.3. Unless otherwise agreed upon, the 
following limitation for heat-treated thickness shall apply:

6.2.3 Method 3-For forgings thicker than described in 
Method 2 (6.2.2): 
6.2.3.1 Prior to heat treatment the forging shall be machined 
to a purchaser supplied or approved drawing that indicates the 
locations of significant in-service loading in the finished part. 
The mechanical test specimens shall be located as an integral 
part of the forging such that the mid-point of the gauge length 
of the tension test specimen and the area under the notch of the 
impact specimens are located no closer than the dimension t 
from one heat treated surface and 2t from any other heat treated 
surface where t is the dimension from the area of significant 
loading to the heat treated surface, or¾ in. [20 mm] whichever 
is the greater. 
6.2.4 Method 4-This method shall be limited to forgings 
with a rough machined weight of not more than 1000 lb [455 
kg]. Separate test forging when agreed upon between the 
purchaser and the supplier. Test coupons representing forgings 
from one heat and one heat treatment lot may be taken from a 
separately forged piece under the following conditions: 
6.2.4.1 The separate test forging shall be of the same heat of 
material and shall be subjected to substantially the same 
reduction and working as the production forging it represents.
