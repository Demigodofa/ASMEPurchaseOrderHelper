General Conditions for Delivery \n3 .1 Except for investment castings, castings furnished to \nthis specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci\u00ad\nfication A703/A703M, including any supplementary require\u00ad\nments that are indicated in the purchase order. Failure to \ncomply with the general requirements of Specification A 703/ \nA 703M constitutes nonconformance with this specification. In \ncase of conflict between the requirements of this specification \nand Specification A 703/ A 703M, this specification shall pre\u00ad\nvail. \n3.2 Steel investment castings furnished to this specification \nshall conform to the requirements of Specification A985/ \nA985M, including any supplementary requirements that are \nindicated in the purchase order. Failure to coniply with the \ngeneral requirements of Specification A985/A985M consti\u00ad\ntutes nonconformance with this specification. In case of con\u00ad\nflict between the requirements of this specification and Speci\u00ad\nfication A985/A985M, Specification A985/A985M shall \nprevail. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 The inquiry and order should include or indicate the \nfollowing: \n4.1.1 A description of the casting by pattern number or \ndrawing (dimensional tolerances shall be included on the \ncasting drawing), \n4.1.2 Grade of steel, \n4.1.3 Options in the specification, \n4.1.4 Whether the castings are to be produced using the \ninvestment casting process, and \n4.1.5 The supplementary requirements desired, including \nthe standards of acceptance. \n5. Heat 'Ireatment \n5.1 \u2022 All castings shall receive a heat treatment proper to their \ndesign and chemical composition. \n5.2 Castings shall be furnished in the normalized and \ntempered conditions; Grades WCI, WC4, WC5, WC6, and \nCA15 shall be tempered at 1100 \u00b0F [595 \u00b0C] min; Grades \nWC9, CS, Cl2, and WCll shall be tempered at 1250 \u00b0F \n[675 \u00b0C] min; Grade C12A shall be thermally treated, either by \nnormalizing and tempering or by accelerated cooling from the \naustenitizing temperature by air blasting or liquid quenching, \nfollowed by tempering. C12A castings shall be austenitized at \n1900 to 1975 \u00b0F [1040 to 1080 \u00b0C] and tempered at 1350 to \n1470 \u00b0F [730 to 800 \u00b0C]. \n5 .3 Heat treatment shall be performed after castings have \nbeen allowed to cool below the transformation range. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall be in accordance with the requirements \nas to chemical composition prescribed in Table 1 (Note 4). \nTABLE 1 Composition RequirementsA,a \nGrade \nUNS Number \nElement,% \nType \nWC1 WC4 WC5 WC6 WC9 WC11 C5 \nJ12524 J12082 J22000 J12072 J21890 J11872 J42045 \nC-Mo Ni-Cr-Mo Ni-Cr-Mo Cr-Mo Cr-Mo Cr-Mo Cr-Mo \nCarbon 0.25 0.05-0.20 0.05-0.20 0.05-0.20 0.05-0.18 0.15-0.21 0.20 \nManganese 0.50-0.80 0.50-0.80 0.40-0.70 0.50-0.80 0.40-0.70 0.50-0.80 0.40-0.70 \nPhosphorus 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.035c 0.035 0.020 0.04c \nSulfur 0.045 0.045 0.045 0.035c 0.035c 0.015 0.045c \nSilicon 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.60 0.30-0.60 0.75 \nNickel 0.70-1.10 0.60-1.00 \nChromium 0.50-0.80 0.50-0.90 1.00-1.50 2.00-2.75 1.00-1.50 4.00-6.50 \nMolybdenum 0.45-0.65 0.45-0.65 0.90-1.20 0.45-0.65 0.90-1.20 0.45-0.65 0.45-0.65 \nNiobium 0 \nNitrogen \nVanadium \nSpecified Residual Elements \nAluminum 0.01 \nCopper 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.35 0.50 \nNickel 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50 \nChromium 0.35 \nTitanium \nTungsten 0.10 0.10 0.10 0.10 0.10 0.10 \nVanadium 0.03 \nZirconium \nTotal Content of 1.00 0.60 0.60 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 \nResidual Elements \nA Where ellipses ( ... ) appear in this table, there is no requirement, and the element need not be analyzed for or reported. \n8 All values are maximums unless a range is provided. \nc For lower maximum phosphorus or sulfur contents, see Supplementary Requirement S52. \n\u00b0 Columbium (Cb) and niobium (Nb) are interchangeable names for the same element 41. \n307 \nC12 C12A CA15 \nJ82090 J84090 J91150 \nCr-Mo Cr-Mo-V Cr \n0.20 0.08-0.12 0.15 \n0.35-0.65 0.30-0.60 1.00 \n0.035c 0.025 0.040c \n0.035c 0.010 0.025c \n1.00 0.20-0.50 1.50 \n0.40 1.00 \n8.00-10.00 8.0-9.5 11.5-14.0 \n0.90-1.20 0.85-1.05 0.50 \n0.03 0.060-0.10 \n0.030-0.070 \n0.06 0.18-0.25 \n0.02 \n0.50 \n0.50 \n0.01 \n0.10 \n0.01 \n1.00 ",
