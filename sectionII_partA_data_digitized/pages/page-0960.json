Keywords 17.2 Government Procurement-When specified in the \ncontract or order, and for direct procurement by or direct \nshipment to the Government when Section 10, Tubular Prod\u00ad\nucts is specified, preservation, packaging, and packing shall be \nin accordance with the Practices A700. \n18.1 alloy steel tube; carbon steel tube; mechanical tubing; \nresistance welded steel tube; steel tube; welded steel tube \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nOne or more of the following supplementary requirements may become a part of the specification \nwhen specified in the inquiry or invitation to bid, and purchase order or contract. These requirements \nshall not be considered, unless specified in the order and the necessary tests shall be made at the mill. \nMechanical tests shall be performed in accordance with the applicable portions of Test Methods and \nDefinitions A370. \nSl. Tubes for Cylinders S3. Cleanup by Machining \nSl.1 Round tubing, DOM for cylinder applications with \ninside diameter cleanup allowances is considered to be cylinder \ntubing. Table Sl.1 shows the minimum inside diameter allow\u00ad\nance for removal of inside surface imperfections by a honing \noperation. \nS3.1 Cleanup is permitted on round tubing, DOM for \napplications where machining is required to remove surface \nimperfections. Table S3.1 shows the minimum stock allowance \nfor removal of surface imperfections from either or both the \noutside and inside surfaces by machining. \nS2. Cleanup by Centerless Grinding S4. Special Smooth Inside Surface S2.1 Round tubing, DOM for applications with outside \ndiameter allowances is considered to be special smooth outside \nsurface tubing. Table S2.1 shows the minimum outside diam\u00ad\neter stock allowance for removal of outside surface imperfec\u00ad\ntions by centerless grinding. \nS4.1 Round tubing, special smooth inside diameter for \ncylinder applications with microinch finish and inside diameter \ncleanup allowances is considered to be special smooth inside \nsurface tubing.
