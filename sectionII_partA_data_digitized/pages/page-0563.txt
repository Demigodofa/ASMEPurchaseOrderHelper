8.2 The results of these analyses shall be reported to the 
purchaser or the purchaser's representative, and shall conform 
to the requirements specified in Table 1. 
8.3 For grade P91 Type 1 the carbon content may vary for 
the product analysis by -0.01 % and +0.02 % from the 
specified range as per Table 1. 
8.4 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 8.1 does 
not conform to the requirements specified in 6.1, an analysis of 
each billet or pipe from the same heat or lot may be made, and 
all billets or pipe conforming to the requirements shall be 
accepted. 
9. Tensile and Hardness Requirements 
9 .1 The tensile properties of the material shall conform to 
the requirements prescribed in Table 3. 
9.2 Table 4 lists elongation requirements. 
9.3 Table 5 gives the computed minimum elongation values 
for each 1/32-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. Where the 
wall thickness lies between two values above, the minimum 
elongation value is determined by the following formula:

Longitudinal, all grades except P23, P24, 
P36, P91 Type 1 and Type 2, P92, 
P921, P93, P115, P122, P128, and 
P911 
Transverse, all grades except P23, P24, 
P36, P91 Type 1 and Type 2, P92, 
P921, P93, P115, P122, P128, and 
P911

where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. or 50 mm, %, and 
t = actual thickness of specimens, in. [mm]. 
Equation 8 
E = 481 + 15.00 
[E = 1.87 t + 15.00] 
E = 321 + 10.00 
[E = 1.25 t + 10.00] 
E = 321 + 10.00 
[E = 1.25 t + 10.00] 
E = 321 + 5.0 
[E = 1.25 t+ 5.0] 
E = 321 + 9.0 
[E = 1.25 t+ 9.0] 
9.4 Table 6 lists hardness requirements. 
9.5 For Grade P91 Type 1 and Type 2, when quenching and 
tempering has been performed, the tensile and hardness prop-
erties shall be met and verified on material taken from the 
half-thickness location. 
10. Permissible Variations in Diameter 
10.1 For pipe ordered to NPS [DN] or outside diameter, 
variations in outside diameter shall not exceed those specified 
in Table 7. 
10.2 For pipe ordered to inside diameter, the inside diameter 
shall not vary more than :±: 1 % from the specified inside 
diameter. 
11. Permissible Variations in Wall Thickness 
11.1 In addition to the implicit limitation of wall thickness 
for pipe imposed by the limitation on weight in Specification 
A999/ A999M, the wall thickness for pipe at any point shall be 
within the tolerances specified in Table 8. The minimum wall 
thickness and outside diameter for inspection for compliance 
with this requirement for pipe ordered by NPS [DN] and 
schedule number is shown in ASME B36.10M. 
12. Hydrostatic Test 
12.1 The requirements for grades other than P91 Type 1 and 
Type 2, P92, P93, P115, P911, P122, and P128 are shown in 
12.1.1 - 12.1.4. 
12.1.1 Each length of pipe with outside diameter greater 
than 10 in. [250 mm] and wall thickness less than or equal to 
0.75 in. [19 mm], shall be submitted to the hydrostatic test, 
except as provided for in 12.1.4. 
12.1.2 Pipe of all other sizes shall be subjected to the 
nondestructive electric test as shown in Section 13, except as 
provided for in 12.1.3 and 12.1.4. 
12.1.3 When specified by the purchaser, pipe of all other 
sizes shall be furnished without the hydrostatic test and without 
nondestructive examination. 
12.1.4 When specified by the purchaser, pipe shall be 
furnished with both the hydrostatic test and a nondestructive 
examination having been performed. 
12.2 The requirements for grades P91 Type 1 and Type 2, 
P92, P93, P115, P911, P122, and P128 are shown in 12.2.1 -
12.2.3. 
12.2.1 Each length of pipe with outside diameter greater 
than 10 in. [250 mm] and wall thickness less than or equal to 
0.75 in. [19 mm], shall be submitted to both the hydrostatic test 
and the ultrasonic test as shown in Section 13.
