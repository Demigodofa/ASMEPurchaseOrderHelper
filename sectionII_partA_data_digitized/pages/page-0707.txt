ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-395/SA-395M 
11.1.2 Test bars removed from castings shall con­
form to Fig. 6. The testing diameter shall be½ in. [12.5 mm] 
if possible. Smaller diameters shall be utilized if necessary. 
11.2 The test coupon size shall be as mutually agreed 
upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. In the 
absence of agreement, it shall be the option of the manufac­
turer. 
11.3 The test coupons shall be cast in molds made of 
suitable core sand having a minimum wall thickness of 
1½ in. [38 mm] for the ½ in. [12.5 mm], 1 in. [25 mm] 
sizes, and 3 in. [75 mm] for the 3 in. [75 mm] size. The 
coupons shall be left in the mold until they have changed 
to a black color (approximately 900°F [480°C] or less). 
The keel block as shown in Fig. 2 or the modified keel 
block produced from the mold shown in Fig. 4 may be 
substituted for the 1 in. [25 mm] block shown in Fig. 3. 
11.4 When investment castings are made to this speci­
fication, the manufacturer may use test specimens cast to 
size incorporated in the mold with the castings or separately 
cast to size using the same type of mold and the same 
thermal conditions that are used to produce the castings. 
These test specimens shall be made to the dimensions 
shown in Fig. 1 of Specification A 732/ A 732M or Fig. 5 
and Fig. 6 of Test Methods and Definitions A 370. 
11.5 The manufacturer shall cast a sufficient number 
of test coupons to provide for each ferritizing anneal. The 
test coupons shall be heat treated with the castings they 
represent. Sectioning of the test coupons prior to heat treat­
ing is not permitted. 
11.6 The metallographic examination shall be made on 
a test lug from the test coupon shown in Fig. 7 or from a 
casting; or from a representative test coupon poured with 
the casting(s). The test coupon shall represent the metal 
treated with the nodularizing agent. 
12. Number of Tests and Retests 
12.1 One tension test shall be made from sections cut 
from the test coupons (Fig. 5) required by Section 11. 
12.1.1 Unless otherwise stated in the contract or 
order for castings, a metallographic examination may be 
substituted for the tension test when separately cast test 
coupons are used. When the microstructure option is used, 
a minimum of one tension test is required from each day's 
melt and for each heat treatment (see 12.2). 
12.2 If any tension test specimen shows obvious 
defects, another from the same coupon, or from another 
coupon/ or representing the same metal and the same anneal 
charge, may be tested. If an apparently sound test specimen 
fails to conform to this specification, castings may be re­
annealed, if required, and two retests made. If either retest 
fails to conform to this specification, the castings they 
represent shall be rejected. 
13. Tension Test Specimen Preparation 
13.1 The standard machined ½ in. [12.5 mm] round 
tension test specimen with 2 in. [50 mm] gage length as 
shown in Fig. 6 shall be used except where the ½ in. 
[12.5 mm] Y-block test coupon is required. In this case, 
either of the small size specimens, 0.375 or 0.250 in. 
[9 or 6.5 mm] round as shown in Fig. 6, shall be used. 
14. Test Methods 
14.1 Chemical analysis shall be made in accordance 
with Test Method E 1806. 
14.2 The yield strength shall be determined in accor­
dance with Test Methods E 8 using one of the following 
methods: 
14.2.1 The 0.2% off-set method, or 
14.2.2 Extension under load method where the yield 
strength may be determined as the stress producing an 
elongation under load of 0.375%; that is, 0.0075 in. 
[0.19 mm] in a gage length of 2 in. [50 mm]. 
14.3 The hardness of the ductile iron as represented 
by the test specimens and castings shall be determined in 
accordance with Test Method E 10. 
657 
14.4 The percentage of each graphite type shall be 
determined by manual counting, semi-automatic, or auto­
matic image analysis methods. The sum of all graphite 
types shall total to 100%. 
15. Records 
15.1 Records of the chemical composition,. mechanical 
properties, and metallographic examination, when applica­
ble, shall be systematically made and maintained. 
16. Inspection 
16.1 Unless otherwise specified in the contract or pur­
chase order, the manufacturer shall be responsible for car­
rying out all the tests and inspection required by this 
specification. 
16.2 The inspector representing the purchaser shall 
have entry at all time, while work on the contract of the 
purchaser is being performed, to all parts of the manufactur­
er's works which concern the manufacturer of the material 
ordered. The manufacturer shall afford the inspector all
