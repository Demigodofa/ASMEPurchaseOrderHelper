NoTE 4-The role of alloying elements in the development of Grade 
Cl2A has been extensively investigated. V and Nb contribute to precipi­
tation strengthening by forming fine and coherent precipitation of M(C, 
N)X carbo-nitrides in the ferrite matrix. V also precipitates as VN during 
tempering or during creep. The two elements are more effective in 
combination. Therefore, the addition of strong nitride-forming elements, 
those with a stronger affinity for nitrogen than Nb and V, as deoxidation 
agents, interferes with these high-temperature strengthening mechanisms. 5 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7 .1 Steel used for the castings shall conform to the require­
ments as to tensile properties given in Table 2. 
7.2 C12A castings shall be hardness tested in accordance 
with Supplementary Requirement Sl3, and shall have a Brinell 
hardness of 185-248 HBW. 
8. Quality 
8.1 The surface of the casting shall be examined visually 
and shall be free of adhering sand, scale, cracks, and hot tears. 
Other surface discontinuities shall meet the visual acceptance 
standards specified in the order. Practice A802/ A802M or other 
visual standards may be used to define acceptable surface 
discontinuities and finish. Unacceptable visual surface discon­
tinuities shall be removed and their removal verified by visual 
examination of the resultant cavities. When methods involving 
high temperatures are used in the removal of discontinuities, 
castings shall be preheated to at least the minimum tempera­
tures in Table 3. 
8.2 Hollow castings of Grade C12A, larger than NPS 4 [DN 
100], and whose internal surfaces are not accessible to the 
visual examination in 8.1, shall be examined by the ultrasonic 
examination prescribed in Supplementary Requirement S7. 
Castings producing a signal equal to or greater than the lowest 
signal produced by the referenced discontinuities shall be 
identified and separated from the acceptable castings. The area 
producing the signal may be re-examined. Such castings shall 
be rejected if the test signals were produced by imperfections

that cannot be identified or were produced by cracks or 
crack-like imperfections. Such castings may be repaired. To be 
accepted, a repaired casting shall pass the ultrasonic examina­
tion and shall meet the minimum wall thickness requirements 
of the purchase order. 
8.3 When additional inspection is desired, Supplementary 
Requirements S4, S5, and SlO may be ordered. 
8.4 The castings shall not be peened, plugged, or impreg­
nated to stop leaks. 
9. Repair by Welding 
9.1 Repairs shall be made using procedures and welders 
qualified under Practice A488/ A488M. 
9.2 All repair welds in Cl2A castings shall be made with 
one of the following welding processes and consumables: 
SMAW, A5.5/A5.5M E90:XX-B9; SAW, A5.23/A5.23M EB9 + 
Neutral Flux; GTAW, A5.28/A5.28M ER90S-B9; and FCAW, 
A5.29/A5.29M E91Tl-B9. In addition, the sum of the Ni+ Mn 
content in all welding consumables used to weld repair Cl2A 
castings shall not exceed 1.0 %. Weld-repaired Grade Cl2A 
castings shall be post-weld heat treated at 1350 to 1470 °F [730 
to 800 °C]. 
9.3 Weld repairs shall be inspected to the same quality 
standards that are used to inspect the castings. When castings
