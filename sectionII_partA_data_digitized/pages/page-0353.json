Heat Treatment \n5 .1 All castings shall receive a heat treatment proper to their \ndesign and chemical composition. \n5.2 Castings shall be furnished in the annealed, or \nnormalized, or normalized and tempered condition unless \nSupplementary Requirement S15 is specified. \n5.3 Heat treatment shall be performed after castings have \nbeen allowed to cool below the transformation range. \n6. Temperature Control \n6.1 Furnace temperatures for heat treating shall be effec\u00ad\ntively controlled by pyrometer. \n7. Chemical Composition \n7.1 The steel shall be in accordance with the requirements \nas to chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. \n8. Tensile Requirements \n8.1 Steel used for the castings shall be in accordance with \nthe requirements as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. \nTABLE 2 Tensile RequirementsA \nMaterial Tensile Yield Elongation Reduction of \nGrade Strength, Strength, 8 in 2 in.

Quality \n9.1 The surface of the casting shall be examined visually \nand shall be free of adhering sand, scale, cracks, and hot tears. \nOther smface discontinuities shall meet the visual acceptance \nstandards specified in the order. Visual Method SP-55 or other \nvisual standards may be used to define acceptable surface \ndiscontinuities and finish. Unacceptable visual surface discon\u00ad\ntinuities shall be removed and their removal verified by visual \nexamination of the resultant cavities. \n9.2 When additional inspection is desired, Supplementary \nRequirements S4, S5, and SlO may be ordered. \n9.3 The castings shall not be peened, plugged, or impreg\u00ad\nnated to stop leaks. \n10. Repair by Welding \n10.1 Repairs shall be made using procedures and welders \nqualified under Practice A488/A488M. \n301 \n10.2 Weld repairs shall be inspected to the same quality \nstandards that are used to inspect the castings. When castings \nare produced with Supplementary Requirement S4 specified, \nweld repairs shall be inspected by magnetic particle examina\u00ad\ntion to the same standards that are used to inspect the castings. \nWhen castings are produced with Supplementary Requirement \nS5 specified, weld repairs on castings that have leaked on \nhydrostatic test, or on castings in which the depth of any cavity \nprepared for repair welding exceeds 20 % of the wall thickness \nor 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is smaller, or on castings in which \nany cavity prepared for welding is greater than approximately \n10 in.2 [65 cm 2 ], shall be radiographed to the same standards \nthat are used to inspect the castings. \n10.3 Castings containing any repair weld that exceeds 20 % \nof the wall thickness or 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is smaller, or \nthat exceeds approximately 10 in.2 [65 cm 2 ] in area, or that was \nmade to correct hydrostatic test defects, shall be stress relieved \nor heat treated after welding. This mandatory stress relief or \nheat treatment shall be in accordance with the procedure \nqualification used. \n11.
