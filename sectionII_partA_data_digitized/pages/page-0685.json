Ordering Information and General Requirements \n3.1 In addition to the ordering information required by \nSpecification A 788/ A 788M, the purchaser shall include with \nthe inquiry and order a detailed drawing, sketch, or written \ndescription of the forging and the areas of significant loading in \nthe forging when required (see 6.4.2.2). \n3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out\u00ad\nlines additional ordering information, manufacturing \nrequirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, \nmarking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi\u00ad\ntional supplementary requirements. \n3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, the \nrequirements of this specification shall prevail. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Melting Practice-The steel melting procedures of \nSpecification A 788/ A 788M shall apply except that for Grades \nM, N, P, and Grades J and Class 110 forgings, only steel that \nhas been vacuum treated before or during the pouring of the \ningot, to remove objectionable gases, particularly hydrogen, \nshall be used. \n4.2 Production Methods-Methods for the production of gas \nbottles and similar vessels shall include the cupping of slabs or \nplates, the piercing of billets or plates, and the subsequent \ndrawing of cups so produced. Such semifinished forgings or \nseamless steel pipe or tubing shall be closed by spinning, \nswedging, or pressing. In all cases, there shall be sufficient \ndiscard to ensure soundness in the completed forging. \n4.3 Heat Treatment: \n4. 3 .1 At the option of the manufacturer, Grades A, B, C, and \nD and Classes 55, 65, and 70 of Grades E, F, G, H, and J \nforgings shall be normalized, normalized and tempered, liquid \nquenched and tempered, or normalized followed by liquid \nquench and temper. \n4.3.2 Grades K, L, M, N, P, and Classes 90 and 110 of \nGrades J and R forgings shall be liquid quenched and \ntempered, or normalized followed by liquid quench and tern-\nper. \n4.3.3 When normalized forgings are to be tempered, or \nwhen forgings have been quenched, they shall be reheated to a \nsubcritical temperature and held for at least\u00bd h/in. [25 mm] of \nmaximum cross section. \n4.3.3.1 Minimum tempering temperatures shall be as fol-\nlows: \nGrades E, F, G, H, J in Classes 55, 65, 70, 90 \nGrade K \n1100 \u00b0F [595 \u00b0C] \n1100 \u00b0F [595 \u00b0C] \n1000 \u00b0F [540 \u00b0C] \n1000 \u00b0F [540 \u00b0C] \n1100 \u00b0F [595 \u00b0C] \nGrades L, N, P, R \nGrade J Class 110 \nGrade M \n4.3.3.2 If an attachment is welded onto a previously \nquenched and tempered pressure vessel, the post-weld heat \ntreatment temperature of a weldment shall not exceed the prior \ntempering temperature of the pressure vessel. Fabrication \nwelding of pressure shell is not permitted. Attachment welding \nbefore heat treatment is not permitted. \n4.3.4 All quenched and tempered forgings shall be subject \nto magnetic particle examination in accordance with Section 7. \n4.3.5 Heat treatment is to be performed after all forming \noperations. \n635 \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.l Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam\u00ad\npling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall \ncomply with Table 1. \n5.2 Product Analysis-The purchaser may use the product \nanalysis provision of Specification A 788/ A 788M to obtain a \nproduct analysis from a forging representing each heat or \nmultiple heat. \n5.3 Starting material produced to a specification that spe\u00ad\ncifically requires the addition of any element beyond those \nlisted in Table 1 for the applicable grade of material is not \npermitted. This does not preclude use of deoxidation or \ninclusion control additions. Supplementary Requirements Sl \nand S2 of Specification A788/A788M shall apply. ",
