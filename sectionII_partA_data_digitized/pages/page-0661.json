The use of conversion values should only be applied when both specimens types (lull-size and sub-size) are in the same fracture regime (in other words. a \nlower shell, transition, or upper shelf) at the test temperature for the material under investigation. In particular test specimens <5 mm can exhibit variable absorbed energy \nvalues (NIST Technical Note 1858). (1) \n8 Limit based upon presentation by Kim Wallin, VTT, \"Sub-sized CVN Specimen Conversion Methodology 4, Slide #10,\" which shows a common relationship for sub-sized \nspecimens up to 75 ft-lbf (102J).
