entire external surface of the tube after holding the pressure for 
not less than 5 s after the surface of the water has become calm. 
If any tube shows leakage during the air underwater test, it 
shall be rejected. Any leaking areas may be cut out and the tube 
retested. 
27.2 Air Pressure Test-When agreed to by the purchaser 
and supplier, a pneumatic pressure test in accordance with Test 
Method A1047/A1047M may be used in lieu of the air 
underwater test. 
Acceptance criteria shall be as follows: 
:51.5 [:540] 
> 1.5 :52.0 [>40 :550] 
>2.0 :52.5 [>50 :565] 
>2.5 :53.0 [>65 :575]

By agreement 
28.1 The producer or supplier shall furnish a certificate of 
compliance stating that the material was manufactured, 
sampled, tested, and inspected in accordance with the 
specification, including year date, the supplementary 
requirements, and any other requirements designated in the 
purchase order or contract, and the results met the requirements 
of that specification, the supplementary requirements and the 
other requirements. A signature or notarization is not required 
on the certificate of compliance, but the document shall be 
dated and shall clearly identify the organization submitting the 
report. Notwithstanding the absence of a signature or 
notarization, the certifying organization is responsible for the 
contents of the document. 
28.2 In addition to the certificate of compliance, the manu­
facturer shall furnish test reports that include the following 
information and test results, where applicable: 
28.2.1 Heat number, 
28.2.2 Heat analysis, 
28.2.3 Product analysis, when specified, 
28.2.4 Tensile prope1ties, 
28.2.5 Width of the gauge length, when longitudinal strip 
tension test specimens are used, 
28.2.6 Flattening test acceptable, 
28.2. 7 Reverse flattening test acceptable, 
28.2.8 Flaring test acceptable, 
28.2.9 Flange test acceptable, 
28.2.10 Hardness test values, 
28.2.11 Hydrostatic test pressure, 
28.2.12 Nondestructive electri.c test method, 
28.2.13 Impact test results, and 
28.2.14 Any other test results or information required to be 
reported by the product specification or the purchase order or 
contract. 
28.3 The manufacturer shall report, along with the test 
report or in a separate document, any other information that is 
required to be reported by the product specification or .the 
purchase order or contract. 
28.4 The certificate of compliance shall include a statement 
of explanation for the letter added to the specification number 
marked on the tubes (see 30.3) when all of the requirements of 
the specification have not been completed. The purchaser must 
certify that all requirements of the specification have been 
completed before the removal of the letter (that is, X, Y, or Z). 
28.5 A test report, certificate of compliance, or similar 
document printed from or used in electronic form from an 
electronic data interchange (EDI) transmission shall be re­
garded as having the same validity as a counterpart printed in 
the certifier's facility. The content of the EDI transmitted 
document shall meet the requirements of the invoked ASTM 
standard(s) and conform to any existing EDI agreement be­
tween the purchaser and supplier. Notwithstanding the absence 
of a signature, the organization submitting the EDI transmis­
sion is responsible for the content of the report. 
29. Inspection 
29.1 The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's inspector 
all reasonable facilities necessary to be satisfied that the 
product is being produced and furnished in accordance with the 
ordered product specification. Mill inspection by the purchaser 
shall not interfere with the manufacturer's operations. 
30. Rejection 
30.1 Each length of tubing received from the manufacturer 
may be inspected by the purchaser and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of the ordered product specification based on the 
inspection and test method as outlined in the ordered product 
specification, the length shall be rejected and the manufacturer 
shall be notified. Disposition of rejected tubing shall be a 
matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the pur­
chaser. 
30.2 Material that fails in any of the forming operations or 
in the process of installation and is found to be defective shall 
be set aside and the manufacturer shall be notified for mutual 
evaluation of the material's suitability. Disposition of such 
material shall be a matter for agreement. 
31. Product Marking 
31.1 Each length of tube shall be legibly stenciled with the 
manufacturer's name or brand, the specification number, and 
grade. The marking need not include the year of issue of the 
specification. For tubes less than 1 ¼ in. [31. 8 mm] in diameter 
and tubes under 3 ft [l m] in length, the required information 
may be marked on a tag securely attached to the bundle or box 
in which the tubes are shipped. 
31.2 For austenitic steel pipe, the marking paint or ink shall 
not contain detrimental amounts of harmful metals, or metal 
salts, such as zinc, lead, or copper, which cause c01Tosive 
attack on heating. 
31.3 When it is specified that certain requirements of a 
specification adopted by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Committee are to be completed by the purchaser upon receipt 
of the material, the manufacturer shall indicate that all require­
ments of the specification have not been completed by a letter 
such as X, Y, or Z, immediately following the specification 
number. This letter may be removed after completion of all 
requirements in accordance with the specification. An expla­
nation of specification requirements to be completed is pro­
vided in 28.4.
