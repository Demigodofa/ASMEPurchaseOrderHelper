S52.4 Weld Qualifications-Repairs shall be made utilizing 
welding procedures qualified in accordance with Section IX of 
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, and repair welding 
shall be done by welders or welding operators meeting the 
qualification requirements of Section IX. In addition to the 
Section IX qualification limits, the weld test plate thickness 
shall be as agreed upon between the casting supplier and the 
purchaser, but no less than 1.5 times the maximum weld repair 
depth. The weld deposit thickness shall be at least 80 % of the 
maximum repair depth. 
S52.4.1 When the thickness of the qualification coupon is 
less than or equal to 4 in. [100 mm], and the qualification 
coupon is subjected to a post-weld solution heat treatment in 
accordance with Table 1, Charpy impact testing shall be 
performed at one of the test temperatures listed in Table S52.2.

Solution-Treated Coupons 
NOTE 1-It is recommended that test temperature selection be deter­
mined based on the intended service temperature of the casting.

weld cap and mid-thickness of the weld deposit. Three speci­
mens shall be removed from each of these three locations: the 
fusion line, fusion line + 2 mm, and fusion line + 5 mm. The 
average value of the three specimens shall not be less than 
specified in Table Table S52.2, with no more than one value 
permitted below the average minimum specified and no value 
permitted below the minimum specified for a single specimen.

Charpy impact testing shall be performed at one of the test 
temperatures listed in Table S52.3. The test temperature shall

S52.4.4 A Test Methods G48 Method A test shall be 
performed on a sample removed from the weld qualification 
coupon; the sample shall include approximately 50 % weld 
material and 50 % base material. Weld test coupons subjected 
to a post-weld solution heat treatment shall be tested at 60 °C. 
Weld test coupons not being subjected to a post-weld solution 
heat treatment shall be tested at 50 °C. Regardless of heat treat 
condition, the acceptance criteria and test time shall be the 
same as outlined in S52.3.
