Terminology \n3.1 Definitions: \n3.1.1 The definitions in Test Methods and Definitions A370, \nTerminology A941, and Test Methods Al058 are applicable to \nthis specification and to those listed in 1. 1. \n3.1.2 chaplet, n-a chaplet is a metallic support placed in a \nmold cavity to maintain the spacing between a core and the \nmold. \n3.1.3 electronic data interchange (EDI), n-the computer\u00ad\nto-computer exchange of business information in a standard \nformat such as ANSI ASC X12. \n3.1.4 heat, n-all the molten metal poured from a single \nfurnace or all the molten metal from two or more furnaces \npoured into a single ladle or casting prior to the replenishing of \nthe fumace(s). \n3.1.5 internal chill, n-an internal chill is a metallic device \nplaced in a mold cavity to increase the rate of heat removal at \nthat location. \n3.1.6 test coupon, n-the part from which the test specimen \nwill be extracted. \n3.1.7 test specimen, n-the part that will be acted upon in a \nmechanical test. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Melting Process-The steel shall be made by open\u00ad\nhearth or electric-furnace process, with or without separate \nrefining such as argon-oxygen-decarburization (AOD), unless \notherwise designated by the individual specification. \n4.2 Heat Treatment: \n4.2.1 Ferritic and martensitic steel shall be cooled after \npouring to provide substantially complete transformation of \naustenite prior to heat treatment to enhance mechanical prop\u00ad\nerties. \n4.2.2 Castings shall be heat treated in the working zone of a \nfumace that has been surveyed in accordance with Test Method \nA991/A991M. \n4.2.2.1 When castings are heat treated at temperatures \nabove 2000 \u00b0F [1100 \u00b0C], then the working zone shall have \nbeen established by a survey performed at not more than 25 \u00b0F \n[15 \u00b0C] below nor more than 200 \u00b0F [110 \u00b0C] above the \nminimum heat treatment temperature specified for the grade. If \na minimum heat treatment temperature is not specified for the \ngrade, then the survey temperature shall be not more than 50 \u00b0F \n1153 ",
