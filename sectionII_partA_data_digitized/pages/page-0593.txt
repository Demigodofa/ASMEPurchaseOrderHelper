3. General Conditions for Delivery TABLE 1 Heat-Treatment Requirements 
3.1 Other Than Investment Castings-Material furnished to 
this specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci­
fication A703/A703M, including any supplementary require­
ments that are indicated in the purchase order. Failure to 
comply with the general requirements of Specification A 703/ 
A 703M constitutes nonconformance with this specification. In 
case of conflict between the requirements of this specification 
and Specification A703/A703M, this specification shall pre­
vail. 
3.2 Investment Castings-Material furnished to this specifi­
cation shall conform to the requirements of Specification 
A985/ A985M, including any supplementary requirements that 
are indicated in the purchase order. Failure to comply with the 
general requirements of Specification A985/A985M consti­
tutes nonconformance with this specification. In case of con­
flict between the requirements of this specification and Speci­
fication A985/A985M, Specification A985/A985M shall 
prevail. 
3.3 The post-weld heat treatment requirements of Supple­
mentary Requirement S50 may be specified when austenitic 
castings other than HK, HT, or CT15C are to be subjected to 
severe corrosive service. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 The inquiry and order should include or indicate the 
following: 
4. 1. 1 A description of the casting by pattern number or 
drawing (dimensional tolerances shall be included on the 
casting drawing), 
4.1.2 Grade of steel, 
4.1.3 Options in the specification, and 
4.1.4 Supplementary requirements desired, including the 
standards of acceptance. 
5. Process 
5 .1 The steel shall be made by the electric furnace process 
with or without separate refining such as argon-oxygen decar­
burization (AOD). 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 All castings shall receive a heat treatment at the tem­
perature specified in Table 1, followed by a quench in water or 
rapid cool by other means except as noted. 
NoTE 2-Proper heat treatment of these alloys is usually necessary to 
enhance corrosion resistance and, in some cases, to meet mechanical 
properties. Minimum heat-treat temperatures are specified; however, it is 
sometimes necessary to heat treat at higher temperatures, hold for some 
minimum time at temperature, and then rapidly cool the castings in order 
to enhance the corrosion resistance and meet mechanical properties. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 2. 
8. Tensile Properties 
8.1 Steel used for the castings shall conform to the require­
ments as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 3.

A Grade shall be quenched in water or the castings may be furnace cooled to 
2050 'F [1120 'CJ minimum, held for 15 min minimum, and then quenched in water 
or rapidly cooled by other means. 
8 Castings of these grades shall be held at the specified temperature for a 
minimum of 4 h. 
9. Quality 
9.1 The surface of the casting shall be examined visually 
and shall be free of adhering sand, scale, cracks, and hot tears. 
Other surface discontinuities shall meet the visual acceptance 
standards specified in the order. Visual Method SP-55 or other 
visual standards may be used to define acceptable surface 
discontinuities and finish. Unacceptable visual surface discon­
tinuities shall be removed and their removal verified by visual 
examination of the resultant cavities. 
9.2 When additional inspection is desired, Supplementary 
Requirements S5, S6, and SlO may be ordered. 
9.3 The castings shall not be peened, plugged, or impreg­
nated to stop leaks. 
10. Repair by Welding 
I 0.1 Repairs shall be made using procedures and welders 
qualified under Practice A488/ A488M. 
10.2 Weld repairs shall be inspected to the same quality 
standards that are used to inspect the castings. When castings 
are produced with Supplementary Requirement S5 specified, 
weld repairs on castings that have leaked on hydrostatic test, or 
on castings in which the depth of any cavity prepared for repair 
welding exceeds 20 % of the wall thickness or 1 in. [25 mm], 
whichever is smaller, or on castings in which any cavity 
prepared for welding is greater than approximately 10 in.2 
[65 cm 2 ], shall be radiographed to the same standards that are 
used to inspect the castings. When castings are produced with 
Supplementary Requirement S6 specified, weld repairs shall be 
inspected by liquid penetrant examination to the same stan­
dards that are used to inspect the castings. 
10.3 For Grade HGlOMnN, the filler metal to be used shall 
be established by mutual agreement between the manufacturer 
and the purchaser. 
NoTE 3-When austenitic steel castings are to be used in services where 
they will be subject to stress corrosion, the purchaser should so indicate in 
his order and such castings should be solution heat treated following all 
weld repairs.
