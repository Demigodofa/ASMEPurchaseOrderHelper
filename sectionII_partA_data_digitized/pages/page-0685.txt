3. Ordering Information and General Requirements 
3.1 In addition to the ordering information required by 
Specification A 788/ A 788M, the purchaser shall include with 
the inquiry and order a detailed drawing, sketch, or written 
description of the forging and the areas of significant loading in 
the forging when required (see 6.4.2.2). 
3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out­
lines additional ordering information, manufacturing 
requirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, 
marking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi­
tional supplementary requirements. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, the 
requirements of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Melting Practice-The steel melting procedures of 
Specification A 788/ A 788M shall apply except that for Grades 
M, N, P, and Grades J and Class 110 forgings, only steel that 
has been vacuum treated before or during the pouring of the 
ingot, to remove objectionable gases, particularly hydrogen, 
shall be used. 
4.2 Production Methods-Methods for the production of gas 
bottles and similar vessels shall include the cupping of slabs or 
plates, the piercing of billets or plates, and the subsequent 
drawing of cups so produced. Such semifinished forgings or 
seamless steel pipe or tubing shall be closed by spinning, 
swedging, or pressing. In all cases, there shall be sufficient 
discard to ensure soundness in the completed forging. 
4.3 Heat Treatment: 
4. 3 .1 At the option of the manufacturer, Grades A, B, C, and 
D and Classes 55, 65, and 70 of Grades E, F, G, H, and J 
forgings shall be normalized, normalized and tempered, liquid 
quenched and tempered, or normalized followed by liquid 
quench and temper. 
4.3.2 Grades K, L, M, N, P, and Classes 90 and 110 of 
Grades J and R forgings shall be liquid quenched and 
tempered, or normalized followed by liquid quench and tern-
per. 
4.3.3 When normalized forgings are to be tempered, or 
when forgings have been quenched, they shall be reheated to a 
subcritical temperature and held for at least½ h/in. [25 mm] of 
maximum cross section. 
4.3.3.1 Minimum tempering temperatures shall be as fol-
lows: 
Grades E, F, G, H, J in Classes 55, 65, 70, 90 
Grade K 
1100 °F [595 °C] 
1100 °F [595 °C] 
1000 °F [540 °C] 
1000 °F [540 °C] 
1100 °F [595 °C] 
Grades L, N, P, R 
Grade J Class 110 
Grade M 
4.3.3.2 If an attachment is welded onto a previously 
quenched and tempered pressure vessel, the post-weld heat 
treatment temperature of a weldment shall not exceed the prior 
tempering temperature of the pressure vessel. Fabrication 
welding of pressure shell is not permitted. Attachment welding 
before heat treatment is not permitted. 
4.3.4 All quenched and tempered forgings shall be subject 
to magnetic particle examination in accordance with Section 7. 
4.3.5 Heat treatment is to be performed after all forming 
operations.

5. Chemical Composition 
5.l Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam­
pling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall 
comply with Table 1. 
5.2 Product Analysis-The purchaser may use the product 
analysis provision of Specification A 788/ A 788M to obtain a 
product analysis from a forging representing each heat or 
multiple heat. 
5.3 Starting material produced to a specification that spe­
cifically requires the addition of any element beyond those 
listed in Table 1 for the applicable grade of material is not 
permitted. This does not preclude use of deoxidation or 
inclusion control additions. Supplementary Requirements Sl 
and S2 of Specification A788/A788M shall apply.
