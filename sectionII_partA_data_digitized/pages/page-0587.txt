ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-350/SA-350M (ASTM A350/A350M) 
A 5.5. For Grade LF6, the electrodes shall be low-hydrogen, 
E-X:X:15, E-XX16, or E-XX18 complying with AWS A 5.1 or 
A 5.5, as applicable. 
11.3.4 After repair welding, the area welded shall be com­
pletely free of defects as verified by magnetic particle or liquid 
penetrant inspection. 
11.3.5 Forgings repair welded in the normalized, normal­
ized and tempered, or the quenched and tempered conditions 
shall be stress-relieved after repair welding at 1100 °F [590 °C] 
minimum, but not higher than the temperature previously used 
for tempering the base metal of the same forging, or shall be 
reheat treated in accordance with 5.4. 
11.3.6 When the purchaser specifies Supplementary Re­
quirement S5, the same requirements shall apply to the weld 
procedure qualification tests. 
11.3.7 Repair by welding shall not exceed 10 % of the 
surface area of the forging or 33 1/3 % of the wall thickness of 
the finished forging, or % in. [9.5 mm], whichever is less, 
without prior approval of the purchaser. 
11.3.8 When approval of the purchaser is obtained, the 
limitations set forth in 11.3.7 may be exceeded, but all other 
requirements of 11.3 shall apply. 
12. Inspection 
12.1 Inspection provisions of Specification A961/A961M 
shall apply. 
13. Rejection and Rehearing 
13 .1 Purchaser shall comply with provisions of Specifica­
tion A961/A961M. 
14. Certification 
14.1 In addition to the requirements of Specification A961/ 
A961M, test reports shall be furnished to the purchaser or his 
representative. Test reports shall provide the following where 
applicable: 
14.1.1 Type heat treatment, Section 5, 
14.1.2 Chemical analysis results, Section 6 (Table 1), re­
ported results shall be to the same number of significant figures 
as the limits specified in Table 1 for that element, 
14.1.3 Product analysis results, 6.2 (Table 1), 
14.1.4 Tensile property results, Section 7 (Table 2) report 
the yield strength and ultimate strength, in ksi [MPa], elonga­
tion and reduction in area, in percent, 
14.1.5 Impact test results, 7.2 (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, and 
Table 6), 
14.1.6 Hardness results, 7.3.1, and 
14.1.7 Any supplementary testing required by the purchase 
order. 
15. Product Marking 
15.1 In addition to the marking requirements of Specifica­
tion A961/A961M, the following additional requirements shall 
apply: 
15.1.1 If the forgings have been quenched and tempered or 
quenched-and-precipitation heat treated, the letters QT shall be 
stamped on the forgings following the ASTM designation. 
15.1.2 Forgings repaired by welding shall be marked with 
the letter W following the ASTM designation. 
15.1.3 If identification stamps are objectionable and detri­
mental to the forging, and when so stated on the purchase 
order, the marks may be painted or stenciled on the forging, or 
stamped on a metal or plastic tag which shall be securely 
attached to the forging. 
535 
15.1.4 Additional marks shall be used as necessary to 
identify the part with the test report. 
15.1.5 If the test temperature is other than the standard 
temperature specified in Table 4, the mark shall also include 
the suffix letter S to the grade and class and the test tempera­
ture. A prefix 0 to the test temperature shall indicate a less than 
0 °F [-18 °C] value. For example, LF2S 0175 denotes a test 
temperature of -175 °F [-115 °C] for an LF2 part .. 
15.1.6 Parts meeting all requirements for more than one 
class may be marked with more than one class such as LF2 
CL1/C12; LF5 CL1/CL2, and so forth. 
15.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 15.1, 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used. The bar coding system, if applied at 
the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one of 
the published industry standards for bar coding. If used on 
small parts, the bar code may be applied to the box or a 
substantially applied tag.
