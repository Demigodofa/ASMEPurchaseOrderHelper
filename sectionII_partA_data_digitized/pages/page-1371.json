[25 mm] long from each \nlot of straight tubes shall be tested in the finished condition in \naccordance with the appropriate practice in Practices A 763 for \nthe specified grade, or as agreed upon for TP409. \n11.3 The appearance of any fissures or cracks in the test \nspecimen, when evaluated in accordance with the Evaluation \nSections of Practices A 763 indicating the presence of inter\u00ad\ngranular attack, shall be cause for rejection of that lot. \n11.4 For corrosion test requirements, the term \"lot\" applies \nto all tubes, p1ior to cutting to length, of the same nominal \ndiameter and wall thickness, produced from the same heat of \nsteel and annealed in a continuous furnace at the same \ntemperature, time at temperature, and furnace speed. \n12. Permissible Variations in Dimensions (Fig. I) \n12.1 Permissible variations from the specified outside diam\u00ad\neter shall be in accordance with Specification A1016/A1016M. \nThose tolerances do not apply to the bent portion of the \nU-tubes. At the bent portion of a U-tube for R = 2 x D or \ngreater, neither the major nor minor diameter of the tube shall \ndeviate from the nominal diameter prior to bending by more \nthan 10 %. If less than 2 x D is specified, tolerances could be \ngreater. \nRADIUS \"R'' \nCENTERLINE \nOF SEND \nr \nLEG LENGTH. \nDIFFERENCE \n! \nPO!NTSOF \nTANGENCY \nI \n1 \nI \nl \nI \nI \nI \nI \nI \nI \nI \nDEVIATION \nFROM PLANE \nF8END \nLEG \nLENGTH \n\"T\"-l\u2022t: _J WALL \u2022 THK '\"\"',__ __ 2 \"R\" + \"0\" \u2022 \nf'l.A!i VIEV,\u00a3 \nFIG. 1 Plane Bend for U-Tube \nt~D~I \nOUTSIDE \nDIAMETER \n12.2 Permissible Variations from the Specified Wall Thick\u00ad\nness: \n12.2.1 Permissible variations from the specified minimum \nwall thickness shall not exceed +20 - 0 %. \n12.2.2 Permissible variations from the specified average \nwall thickness are \u00b1 10 % of the nominal wall thickness. \n12.2.3 The wall thickness of the tube in the U-bent section \nshall not be less than value determined by the equation: \n4RT \nt1= 4R+D \nwhere: \nfr = wall thickness after bending, in. [mm], \nT = specified minimum tube wall thickness, in. [mm], \nR = centerline bend radius, in. [mm], and \nD = nominal outside tube diameter, in. [mm]. \n12.3 Permissible Variations from the Specified Length: \n12.3.1 Straight Lengths-The maximum permissible varia\u00ad\ntions for lengths 24 ft [7.3 m] and shorter shall be + 1/s in. [+3 \nmm], -0; for lengths longer than 24 ft [7.3 m], an additional \nover tolerance of +\\Is in. [+3 mm] for each 10 ft [3 m], or \nfraction thereof, shall be permitted up to a maximum of +\\/2 in. \n[+13 mm]. \n12.3.2 U-Bends-In the case of U-tubes, the length of the \ntube legs, as measured from the point of tangency of the bend \nand the tube leg to the end of the tube leg, shall not be less than \nspecified, but may exceed the specified values by the amount \ngiven in Table 5. The difference in lengths of the tube legs shall \nnot be greater than 1/s in. [3 mm] unless otherwise specified. \n12.4 The end of any tube may depart from square by not \nmore than the amount given in Table 6. \n12.5 The leg spacing measured between the points of \ntangency of the bend to the legs shall not vary from the value \n(2R-specified tube outside diameter) by more than 1/16 in. [1.5 \nmm] where R is the center-line bend radius. \n12.6 The bent portion of the U-tube shall be substantially \nuniform in curvature, and not to exceed \u00b1 1/1.6 in. [ \u00b1: 1.5 mm] of \nthe nominal center-line radius. \n12.7 Permissible deviation from the plane of bend (see Fig. \n1) shall not exceed \\/16 in. [1.5 mm] as measured from the \npoints of tangency. \n13. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n13 .1 Tubing purchased to this specification is intended for \nuse in heat exchangers and will be inse1ted through close\u00ad\nfitting holes in baffles or support plates, or both, spaced along \nthe tube length. The tube ends will also be inserted into very \nclose-fitting holes in a tubesheet and expanded and may be \nwelded therein. The tubes shall be able to stand roll expanding \n(See Note 1) and bending without showing cracks and flaws, \nand shall be finished reasonably straight and suitable for the \n1309 \nTABLE 5 Tube Leg Length Tolerance \nLeg Length, ft [m] \nUp to 20 [6], incl \nOver 20 to 30 [6 to 9], incl \nOver 30 to 40 [9 to 12], incl \nPlus Tolerance, in.
