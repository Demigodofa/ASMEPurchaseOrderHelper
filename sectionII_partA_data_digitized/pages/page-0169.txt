TABLE A2.7 Permissible Variations in Dimensions for Half-Rounds, Ovals, Half-Ovals, and Other Special Bar Size Sections 
Due to mill facilities, tolerances on half-rounds, ovals, and other special bar size sections vary among the manufacturers and such tolerances should be 
negotiated between the manufacturer and the purchaser.
