Terminology \n3 .1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.1.1 cold-finished steel bars-steel bars produced by cold \nfinishing previously hot-wrought bars by means of cold \ndrawing, cold forming, turning, grinding, or polishing (singly \nor in combination) to yield straight lengths or coils in sections \nthat are uniform throughout their length and in the following \nsections and sizes: \n3.1.1.1 rounds-9 in. [230 mm] and under in diameter, \n3.1.1.2 squares-6 in. [150 mm] and under between parallel \nsurfaces, \n3.1.1.3 hexagons-4 in. [100 mm] and under between par\u00ad\nallel surfaces, \n3.1.1.4 fiats-Vs in. [3 mm] and over in thickness and not \nover 12 in. [300 mm] in width, and \n3.1.1.5 special bar sections. \n3.1.2 hot-wrought steel bars-steel bars produced by hot \nforming ingots, blooms, billets, or other semifinished forms to \nyield straight lengths ( or coils, depending upon size, section, \nand mill equipment) in sections that are uniform throughout \ntheir length, and in the following sections and sizes: \n3.1.2.1 rounds-\u00bd2 in. to 10.0 in. [5.5 mm to 250 mm], \ninclusive; \n3.1.2.2 squares-\u00bd2 in. to 6.0 in. [6 mm to 160 mm], \ninclusive; \n3.1.2.3 round-cornered squares-1/32 in. to 8.0 in. [6 mm to \n200 mm], inclusive; \n3.1.2.4 fiats-\u00bc in. to 8 in. inclusive, in width: 13 /64 in. in \nminimum thickness up to 6 in. in width; and 0.230 in. in \nminimum thickness for over 6 in. to 8 in. in width, inclusive \n[ over 5 mm in thickness up to 150 mm in width; and over 6 mm \nin thickness for over 150 mm through 200 mm in width]. \nMaximum thickness for all widths is 4 in. [100 mm]; \n3.1.2.5 hexagons and octagons-\u00bc in. to 4\u00bd6 in. [6 mm to \n103 mm], inclusive, between parallel surfaces; \n3.1.2.6 bar size shapes-Angles, channels, tees, zees, when \ntheir greatest cross-sectional dimension is under 3 in. [75 mm]; \nand \n3.1.2.7 special bar sections-Half-rounds, ovals, half-ovals, \nother special bar size sections. \n3.1.3 lot-unless otherwise specified in the contract or \norder, a lot shall consist of all bars submitted for inspection at \nthe same time of the same heat, condition, finish, size, or shape. \nFor bars specified in the quenched and tempered condition, \nwhen heat treated in batch-type furnaces, a lot shall consist of \nall bars from the same heat, of the same prior condition, the \nsame size, and subjected to the same heat treatment in one \ntempering charge. For bars specified in the quenched and \ntempered condition, when heat treated without interruption in a \ncontinuous-type furnace, a lot shall consist of all bars from the \nsame heat, of the same prior condition, of the same size, and \nsubjected to the same heat treatment. \n103 ",
