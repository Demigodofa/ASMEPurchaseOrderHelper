Ordering Information and General Requirements \n3.1 In addition to the ordering information required by \nSpecification A788/A788M, the purchaser should include with \nthe inquiry and order the following information: \n3.1.1 A drawing or sketch that shows test locations when the \ntesting is in accordance with 8.2.1.3. \n3.1.2 The intended use of forgings if 5.1 is applicable. \n3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A788/A788M, which out\u00ad\nlines additional ordering information, manufacturing \nrequirements, testing and retesting methods and procedures, \nmarking, certification, product analysis variations, and addi\u00ad\ntional supplementary requirements. \n3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A788/A788M, the \nrequirements of this specification shall prevail. \n3.4 For hubbed flatheads and tube sheets ordered for ASME \nBoiler and Pressure Vessel Code application, Supplementary \nRequirement S12 of Specification A788/A788M shall be \nspecified. \n3.5 At the purchaser's request the forgings shall be rough \nmachined before heat treatment (5.2). \n3.6 For Section III, Part NB of the ASME Boiler and \nPressure Vessel Code application, Supplementary Requirement \nS3 shall be specified. \n4. Melting and Forging \n4.1 In addition to the melting and forging requirements of \nSpecification A788/A788M, which may be supplemented by \nSupplementary Requirement S8, the following conditions ap\u00ad\nply: \n4.1.1 A sufficient discard shall be made to secure freedom \nfrom injurious pipe and undue segregation. \n5. Machining \n5.1 Forged pressure vessels for steam power service shall \nhave the inner surface machined or ground. Unfired pressure \nvessels shall have the inner surfaces sufficiently free of scale to \npermit inspection. \n5.2 Unless otherwise specified by the purchaser, when \nrough machining is performed, it may be done either before or \nafter heat treatment at the manufacturer's option. \n6. Heat Treatment \n6.1 Except as permitted in 6.1.1 for Grade F22V, and in \n6.1.2 for Grade F91 Type 1 and Type 2 and Grade F92, the steel \nforgings shall be annealed or normalized and tempered but \nalternatively may be liquid quenched and tempered when \nmutually agreed upon between the manufacturer and the \npurchaser. For all grades, normalizing or liquid quenching shall \nbe followed by tempering at a subcritical temperature as shown \nin 6.1.4. \n6.1.1 Grade F22V forgings shall be normalized and tem\u00ad\npered or liquid quenched and tempered at the manufacturer's \noption. \n6.1.1.1 For Grade F22V forgings the minimum austenitizing \ntemperature shall be 1650 \u00b0F [900 \u00b0C]. \n6.1.2 Grade F91 Type 1 and Type 2 forgings having any \nsection thickness greater than 3 in. [75 mm] shall be normal\u00ad\nized and tempered or liquid quenched and tempered at the \nmanufacturer's option. Grade F92 forgings shall be normalized \nand tempered or liquid quenched and tempered at the manu\u00ad\nfacturer's option. \n6.1.2.1 For Grade F91 Type 1 and Type 2, F911, and F92 \nforgings, the austenitizing temperature shall be in the range of \n1900 \u00b0F to 1975 \u00b0F [1040 \u00b0C to 1080 \u00b0C]. \n6.1.3 For Grade F6NM the austenitizing temperature shall \nbe 1850 \u00b0F [1010 \u00b0C] minimum. The tempering temperature \nrange shall be as shown in 6.1.4. \n520 \n6.1.4 Except for the following grades, the minimum tem\u00ad\npering temperature shall be 1100 \u00b0F [595 \u00b0C]: \nGrade \nF6 \nF6NM \nF11, Class 2 \nF11, Class 3 \nF11, Class 1 \nF5, F5a \nF9 \nF21, Class 1 \nF3V, F3VCb \nF22, Class 1 \nF22V \nF91 Type 1 and Type 2, F92 \nF911 \nF22, Class 3 \n7. Chemical Composition \nTempering Temperature \nMinimum or Range, \u00b0F [\u00b0C] \n1150 (620] \n1040-1120 (560-600] \n1150 (620] \n1150 (620] \n1150 (620] \n1250 (675] \n1250 (675] \n1250 (675] \n1250 (675] \n1250 [675] \n1250 [675] \n1350-1470 (730-800] \n1365-1435 (740-780] \n1250 (675] \n7.I Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam\u00ad\npling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M and shall \ncomply with Table 2. \n7.2 Product Analysis-The manufacturer shall use the prod\u00ad\nuct analysis provision of Specification A788/A788M to obtain \na product analysis from a forging representing each heat or \nmultiple heat. The product analysis for columbium and calcium \nfor Grade F22V shall conform to the requirements of Table 2 \nof this specification. Boron is not subject to product analysis. \nThe purchaser may also make this determination in accordance \nwith Specification A788/A788M. \n8. Mechanical Properties \n8.1 General Requirements-The material shall conform to \nthe requirements for mechanical properties prescribed in Table \n1. The largest obtainable tension test specimen as specified in \nTest Methods and Definitions A370 shall be used. \n8.2 Sampling-The mid-point of the gauge length of tension \ntest specimens and the area under the notch of impact speci\u00ad\nmens shall be located in accordance with one of the following \nmethods as specified by the purchaser, or suggested by the \nsupplier and approved by the purchaser. Unless otherwise \nnoted, all testing shall be from integral prolongations of the \nforging. ",
