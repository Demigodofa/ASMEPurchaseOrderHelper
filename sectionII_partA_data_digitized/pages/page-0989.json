(1.58 mm). \nNoTE 5-Marks and abrasions are defined as cable marks, dinges, guide \nmarks, roll marks, ball scratches, scores, die marks, and the like. \n14.3.2 Visual imperfections, commonly refetTed to as scabs, \nseams, laps, tears, or slivers, found by exploration in accor\u00ad\ndance with 14.1 to be deeper than 5 % of the nominal wall \nthickness. \n14.4 At the purchaser's discretion, pipe shall be subject to \nrejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 14.2 are not \nscattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is \nconsidered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall \nbe a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the \npurchaser. \n14.5 When imperfections or defects are removed by \ngiinding, a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the \nwall thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by \nthis specification. The outside diameter at the point of grinding \nmay be reduced by the amount so removed. \n14.5.1 Wall thickness measurements shall be made with a \nmechanical caliper or with a properly calibrated nondestruc\u00ad\ntive testing device of appropriate accuracy. In case of dispute, \n16. Test Specimens and Methods of Testing \n16.1 Specimens cut either longitudinally or transversely \nshall be acceptable for the tension test. \n16.2 Test specimens for the bend test specified in 9.2 and for \nthe flattening tests specified in Section 10 shall consist of \nsections cut from a pipe. Specimens for flattening tests shall be \nsmooth on the ends and free from burrs, except when made on \ncrop ends. \n16.3 Test specimens for the bend test specified in 9.2.2 shall \nbe cut from one end of the pipe and, unless otherwise specified, \nshall be taken in a transverse direction. One test specimen shall \nbe taken as close to the outer surface as possible and another \nfrom as close to the inner surface as possible. The specimens \nshall be either \u00bd by \u00bd in. [12.7 mm] in section or 1 by \u00bd in. \n[25.4 by 12.7 mm] in section with the corners rounded to a \nradius not over 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] and need not exceed 6 in. \n[152 mm] in length. The side of the samples placed in tension \nduring the bend shall be the side closest to the inner and outer \nsurface of the pipe respectively. \n17. Lengths \n17 .1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following \nregular practice: \n17 .1.1 The lengths required shall be specified in the order, \nand \n17 .1.2 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise specified. \n17.2 If definite lengths are not required, pipe may be \nordered in single random lengths of 16 to 22 ft [4.9 to 6.7 m], \nwith 5 % 12 to 16 ft [3.7 to 4.9 m], or in double random lengths \nwith a minimum average of 35 ft [10.7 m] and a minimum \nlength of 22 ft [6.7 m] with 5 % 16 to 22 ft [4.9 to 6.7 m]. \nthe measurement determined by use of the mechanical caliper 18. Rejection \nshall govern. 18.1 Each length of pipe that develops injurious defects \n14.6 Weld repair shall be permitted only subject to the during shop working or application operations will be rejected, \napproval of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification and the manufacturer shall be notified. No rejections under this \nA530/A530M. or any other specifications shall be marked as specified in \n14.7 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight.

Number of Tests and Retests which case it may be sold under the weiglit speclficafions with---\n15.1 One of either of the tests specified in 9.1 shall be made which it does comply. \non one length of pipe from each lot (Note 2). \n15.2 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50) and under, the bend test \nspecified in 9.2 shall be made on one pipe from each lot (Note \n2). The bend tests specified in 9.2.2 shall be made on one end \nof each pipe. \n15.3 The flattening test specified in Section 10 shall be \nmade on one length of pipe from each lot (Note 2). \n15.4 Retests shall be in accordance with Specification \nA530/A530M and as provided in 15.5 and 15.6. \n15.5 If a specimen breaks in an inside or outside snrface \nflaw, a retest shall be allowed. \n15.6 Should a crop end of a finished pipe fail in the \nflattening test, one retest may be made from the broken end. \n19. Product Marking \n19.1 In addition to the marking prescdbed in Specification \nA530/A530M, the marking shall include the hydrostatic test \npressure when tested or the letters \"NH\" when not tested, the \nlength and schedule number, and on pipe sizes larger than \nNPS 4 [DN 100] the weight shall be given. Length shall be \nmarked in feet and tenths of a foot, or metres to two decimal \nplaces, depending on the units to which the material was \nordered, or other marking subject to agreement. \n889 \n19.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 19.1, \nbar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification \nmethod. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar \ncoding system to be used. ",
