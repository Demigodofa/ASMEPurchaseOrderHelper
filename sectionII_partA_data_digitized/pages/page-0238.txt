INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Steel Pipe 1 
This standard is issued uuder the fixed designation A135/A135M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers two grades of electric­
resistance-welded steel pipe in NPS 2 to NPS 30 [DN 50 to DN 
750] inclusive, with nominal (average) wall thickness up to 
0.500 in. [12.70 mm], inclusive, and in nominal sizes NPS 
¾ to NPS 5 [DN 20 to DN 125] inclusive with nominal 
(average) wall thickness 0.083 in. [2.11 mm] to 0.134 in. [3.40 
mm], depending on size. Pipe having other dimensions (Note 
1) may be furnished provided such pipe complies with all other 
requirements of this specification. The pipe is intended for 
conveying gas, vapor, water or other liquid; only Grade A is 
adapted for flanging and bending (Note 2). The suitability of 
pipe for various purposes is somewhat dependent upon its 
dimensions, properties, and conditions of service, so that the 
purpose for which the pipe is intended should be stated in the 
order. The pipe may be furnished either nonexpanded or cold 
expanded at the option of the manufacturer. When pipe is cold 
expanded, the amount of expansion shall not exceed 1.5 % of 
the outside diameter pipe size. 
NOTE 1-A comprehensive listing of standardized pipe dimensions is 
contained in ASME B36.lOM. 
NOTE 2-This provision is not intended to prohibit the cold bending of 
Grade B pipe. 
1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.3 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
