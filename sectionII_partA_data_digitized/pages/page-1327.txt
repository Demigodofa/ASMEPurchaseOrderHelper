The taper is to be selected by the producer for ease of drawing the 
pattern from the mold. 
where: 
N = number of specimens to be cut from one side of the coupon, 
D = diameter of the specimens, and 
(bl Cylinder 
Wiot = the total width of metal required to remove the coupon from the casting, 
and to machine specimens from the coupon. 
GENERAL NOTE: Longitudinal axis and gage length of test specimen must be within shaded zone.
