May also apply to work hardened condition or \nstrength level, or both. \n3.1.8 grade-an alloy described individually and identified \nby its own designation in a table of chemical requirements \nwithin any specification. \n3.1.9 length, components subject to full size testing-that \nportion of the bolting component whose body diameter is \napproximately the same as the nominal thread size. \n3.1.10 lot-unless otherwise specified, a lot shall consist of: \n3.1.10.1 bolting, heat treated in batch type furnaces-all \nbolting material of the same heat or cast of material, condition, \nfinish, and size subjected to the same heat treatment in one \ntempering charge and submitted for inspection at the same \ntime. \n3.1.10.2 bolting, heat treated in continuous typefumaces\u00ad\nall bolting material of the same heat or cast of material, \ncondition, finish, and size heat treated without interruption in a \ncontinuous type furnace. \n3.1.10.3 bolting, non heat treated (strain hardened)-all \nbolting material of the same heat or cast of material, condition, \nreduction (cold work), finish, and size. \n3.1.10.4 components, machined from bolting material-all \nbolting components machined from the same lot of bolting \nmaterial defined as outlined in either 3.1.10.1 or 3.1.10.2, \nabove without any subsequent heat treatment or hot or cold \nforming. \n3.1.10.5 components, heat treated in batch typefumaces\u00ad\nall bolting component items produced by any manufacturing \nprocess (such as rolling, forging, or machining) from the same \nheat or cast of material, of the same prior condition, the same \nsize, and subjected to the same heat treatment in one tempering \ncharge. \n3.1.10.6 components, heat treated in continuous type \nfurnaces-all bolting component items produced by any manu\u00ad\nfacturing process (such as rolling, forging, or machining) from \nthe same heat or cast of material, of the same prior condition, \nof the same size, and then subjected to the same heat treatment \nin a four hour period and in one tempering charge. \n3.1.10.7 components, non heat treated (strain hardened)\u00ad\nall bolting components of the same heat or cast of material, \ncondition, reduction (cold work), finish, and size. \n3.1.10.8 solution treat or treatment ( or solution \nannealing)-material shall be heated to a temperature that \ncauses the carbides to go into solution and then quenched in \nwater or rapidly cooled by other means to prevent re\u00ad\nprecipitation. \n3.1.10.9 stress relieving-material shall be uniformly heated \nto the selected stress relieving temperature, held long enough \nto reduce stresses and then cooled at a rate that will result in the \nproperties required for the material grade and minimize the \ndevelopment of new residual stresses. \n3.1.10.10 strain hardened material-austenitic stainless \nsteel material which has been subjected to cold working \nsufficient to cause a significant increase in strength. \n3.2 Definitions-For definitions of other terms used in this \nspecification, refer to Terminology A941. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 It is the purchaser's - responsibility to specify in the \npurchase order all information necessary to purchase the \nneeded material. Examples of such information include, but are \nnot limited, to the following: \n4.1.1 Quantity and size, \n4.1.2 Product specification number with grade, class, type, \nas applicable, and including the product specification year date, \n4.1.3 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test \nMethods A1058 when material is ordered to an M suffix (SI \nunits) product standard. If the choice of test track is not \nspecified in the order, then the default ASTM track shall be \nused as noted in Test Methods A1058. \n4.1.4 Any additional information required by the individual \nproduct specification, \n4.1.5 Supplementary requirements, \n4.1.6 Additional requirements (see 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, 6.1, 7.4, \n13.1, 13.3.1, 13.3.3, 13.5.2, 13.6, 15.8, and 19.1). \n4.1.7 Additional ordering options provided in the individual \nproduct specification, and \n4.1.8 Dimensions (diameter, length of point, overall length, \nfinish, shape, threads, etc.). \n5. Melting Process \n5.1 The steel shall be produced by any of the following \nprocesses: basic-oxygen, electric-furnace, or vacuum\u00ad\ninduction melting (VIM). The molten steel may be vacuum\u00ad\ntreated prior to or during pouring of the ingot or strand casting. \n5.2 Unless otherwise specified in the individual product \nspecification, the steel shall be fully killed. Use of the basic \noxygen process shall be limited to grades containing less than \n6 % chromium. \n5.3 If a specific type of melting is required by the purchaser, \nit shall be stated on the purchase order. \n5.4 The primary melting may incorporate separate degas\u00ad\nsing or refining and may be followed by secondary melting \n1414 ",
