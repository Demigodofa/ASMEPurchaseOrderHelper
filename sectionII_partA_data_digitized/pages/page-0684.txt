SA-372/SA-372M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Carbon and Alloy Steel Forgings for Thin-Walled Pressure 
Vessels 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers relatively thin-walled forg­
ings (including gas bottles) for pressure vessel use. Three types 
of carbon steel and six types of alloy steel are included. 
Provision is made for integrally forging the ends of vessel 
bodies made from seamless pipe or tubing. 
NoTE I-When working to the chemical and tensile requirements of 
this specification, the influence of wall thickness and cooling rate will 
necessarily eliminate certain forging sizes in each class.

1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
634 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other, and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined. 
1.3 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation (SI units), the mate1ial shall be furnished to 
inch-pound units. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
