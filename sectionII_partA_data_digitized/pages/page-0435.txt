NoTE 1-The gage length and fillets shall be as shown, but the ends 
may be of any shape to fit the holders of the testing machine in such a way 
that the load shall be axial. The reduced section shall be a gradual taper 
from the ends toward the center, with the ends 0.003 to 0.005 in. larger in 
diameter than the center.

millings without danger of contamination from the adjacent 
layer. If spectrometric procedures are used, the sample shall be 
exposed on the center line of the cladding when there is 
sufficient cladding thickness available so that there is no 
contamination from the adjacent base metal. 
10.2 If product analysis is specified by the purchaser for the 
cladding alloy, it shall be made on a sample taken from the 
finished product or a broken test specimen. For wet chemical 
analysis, in order to avoid contamination by the base plate 
metal, millings of cladding samples shall be taken from the test 
coupon by removal and discard of all the base metal plus 40 % 
of the cladding thickness from the bonded side, not to exceed 
1/16 in. (1.6 mm). The material shall be cleaned and sufficient 
minings taken to represent the full cross-section of the remain­
der. If there is insufficient cladding thickness available to 
spectrographically expose on the center line of the cladding 
without contamination, 50 % of the cladding shall be removed 
and the sample exposed on this surface. 
10.3 The results of the product analysis shall conform to the 
requirements of Section 7 of Specification A480/A480M. 
10.4 Methods and practices relating to chemical analysis 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with the 
Test Methods, Practices, and Definitions of A751. 
10.5 Results of the product analysis for the backing steel 
when required shall conform to the requirements of Section 7 
of Specification A20/ A20M. 
11. Permissible Variations 
11.1 Permissible variations except for thickness shall be in 
accordance with Specification A20/ A20M. 
11.2 Minimum thickness of the alloy cladding metal and of 
the backing steel, or of the total composite plate shall be as 
required by purchase order documents when ordered to mini­
mum thicknesses. 
11.3 Permissible variation in thickness when ordered to 
nominal thicknesses shall be 0.01 in. (0.3 mm) under each for 
backing steel or total composite, and 0.03 in. (0.8 mm) under 
for the alloy cladding. 
11.4 Permissible variations for excess thickness of the total 
composite shall be the greater of 0.125 in. (3 mm) or 10 % of 
the total composite thickness ordered and may occur in either 
backing steel, cladding, or both, provided the minimum for 
each is met. 
11.5 More restrictive or less restrictive permissible varia­
tions may be agreed upon by the purchaser and the manufac­
turer. 
12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
12.1 The material shall be free of injurious defects, shall 
have a workmanlike appearance, and shall conform to the 
designated finish. 
12.2 Plate alloy surfaces shall be blasted (descaled by 
means of sand or stainless grit, shot, or wire), pickled, 
blast-cleaned and pickled, or 100 % conditioned. 
13. Bond Quality 
13.1 The cladding metal shall be integrally and continu­
ously bonded to the base metal. 
13.2 Inspection: 
13.2.1 Clad plates less than 3/s in. (10 mm) total minimum 
composite thickness shall be visually inspected for bond 
integrity prior to shipment. 
13.2.2 Clad plates 3/s in. (10 mm) and thicker total minimum 
composite thickness, and when specified by the purchaser, clad 
plates less than 3/s in. (10 mm) total minimum composite 
thickness, shall be ultrasonically inspected for bond integrity 
prior to shipment in accordance with the Procedures and 
Methods of Specification A578/A578M. 
13.2.3 Areas of non-bond detected visually shall be ex­
plored ultrasonically to determine the extent of the condition in 
accordance with 13.2.2. For purposes of defining non-bond, the 
cladding shall be interpreted to be unbonded when there is 
complete loss of back reflection accompanied by an echo 
indication from the plane of the interface of the clad and 
backing steel. Areas within 1 in. (25 mm) of a cut edge on the 
plate that contain indications exceeding 50 % of the back 
reflection at the bond interface shall be considered to be 
unbonded. 
13.2.4 Extent of ultrasonic examination shall be at the 
discretion of the manufacturer and sufficient enough to provide 
the quality level required by the purchaser. Plates may be 
ordered with 100 % coverage (Supplementary Requirement 
S12).

13.3 Quality Levels: 
13.3.1 Class I-No single unbonded area exceeding 1 in. 
(25 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not 
to exceed 1 % of the total cladded surface area. 
13.3.2 Class 3-No single unbonded area exceeding 3 in. 
(75 mm) in its longest dimension with total unbonded area not 
to exceed 3 % of the total cladded surface area.
