Terminology \n3.1 Definitions-For definitions of terms used in this \nspecification, refer to Specification A961/A961M. \n4 Available from American Society of Mechanical _Engineers (ASME), ASME \nInternational Headquarters, Two Park Ave., New York, NY 10016-5990, http:// \nwww.asme.org. \n5 Available from American Welding Society (AWS), 550 NW LeJeune Rd., \nMiami, FL 33126, http://www.aws.org. \n3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.2.l hardened condition, n-for F 23, the metallurgical \ncondition achieved after normalizing and cooling to room \ntemperature but prior to tempering. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the \npurchase order information necessary to purchase the needed \nmaterial. In addition to the ordering information guidelines in \nSpecification A961/A961M, orders should include the follow\u00ad\ning information: \n4.1.1 Additional requirements (see 7.2.1, Table 2 footnotes, \n9.3, and 19.2), and \n4.1.2 Requirement, if any, that manufacturer shall submit \ndrawings for approval showing the shape of the rough forging \nbefore machining and the exact location of test specimen \nmaterial (see 9.3.1). \n5. General Requirements \n5 .1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A961/A961M, including any \nsupplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase \norder. Failure to comply with the general requirements of \nSpecification A961/A961M constitutes nonconformance with \nthis specification. In case of conflict between the requirements \nof this specification and Specification A961/A961M, this \nspecification shall prevail. \n6. Manufacture \n6.1 The low-alloy ferritic steels shall be made by the \nopen-hearth, electric-furnace, or basic-oxygen process with the \noption of separate degassing and refining processes in each \ncase. \n6.2 The stainless steels shall be melted by one of the \nfollowing processes: ( a) electric-furnace (with the option of \nseparate degassing and refining processes); (b) vacuum\u00ad\nfumace; or ( c) one of the former followed by vacuum or \nelectroslag-consumable remelting. Grade F XM-27Cb may be \nproduced by electron-beam melting. \n6.3 A sufficient discard shall be made to secure freedom \nfrom injurious piping and undue segregation. \n6.4 Except as permitted in 6.4.2 and 6.4.3, the material shall \nbe forged as close as practicable to the specified shape and size. \n6.4.1 Flanges, elbows, return bends, tees, and header tees \nshall not be machined directly from bar stock. Other parts \nwhose longitudinal axis is not parallel to the longitudinal axis \nof the hollow bar or forged or rolled bar shall not be machined \ndirectly from bar. \n6.4.2 Parts may be machined from hollow bar or forged or \nrolled solution-annealed austenitic stainless steel bar without \nadditional hot working provided the longitudinal axis of the \npart is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bar. \n6.4.3 Low alloy, martensitic stainless, ferritic stainless, and \nferritic-austenitic stainless steel parts, NPS-4 [DN 100] and \nunder, may be machined from hollow bar or forged or rolled \nbar, without additional hot working provided the longitudinal \naxis of the part is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bar. \n213 ",
