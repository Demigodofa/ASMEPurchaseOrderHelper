A Examples-( 1) Assume % steepness is given as 1.5 and the corresponding 
I-unit value is desired. From Table X5.2, I= 2.5(itS) 2 = 2.5((3.14)(1.5)] 2 = 55.5. 
(2) Assume an I-unit value of 25 is given and the corresponding % steepness is 
desired. From Table X5.2, S = 2/it(/ x 10- 1 ) 112 = 2/3.14 (25 x 10- 1 ) 112 = 1.0. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
Committee A0l has identified the location of selected changes to this standard since the last issue 
(A568/A568M- 19) that may impact the use of this standard. (Approved Nov. 1, 2019.) 
( 1) Revised 1.4 to clarify that the values to be rounded are 
measured, calculated, or observed values. 
(2) Added 1.4.1 to differentiate ordered values, which are 
fixed, from measured, calculated, or observed values, which 
are subject to rounding. 
Committee A0l has identified the location of selected changes to this standard since the last issue 
(A568/A568M - 17a) that may impact the use of this standard. (Approved Sept. 1, 2019.) 
( 1) Added flatness tolerances for yield strength greater than 
50 min ksi (340 MPa) to Table 13, Table 14, Table Al.10, and 
Table Al.11.
