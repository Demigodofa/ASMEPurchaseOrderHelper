Terminology \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 It shall be the responsibility of the purchaser to specify \nall requirements necessary for product under this specification. \nSuch requirements to be considered include, but are not limited \nto, the following: \n4.1.1 Quantity (feet, meters, or number of lengths), \n4.1.2 Specification number with grade or class, or both, as \napplicable and year date, \n4.1.3 Manufacture (hot-finished or cold drawn), \n4.1.4 Size (NPS [DN] and weight class or schedule number, \nor both; outside diameter and nominal wall thickness; or inside \ndiameter and nominal wall thickness), \n4.1.5 Length (specific or random), \n4.1.6 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test \nMethods A1058 when material is ordered to an M suffix (SI \nunits) product standard. If the choice of test track is not \nspecified in the order, then the default ASTM test track shall be \nused as noted in Test Methods A1058, \n4.1.7 Supplementary Requirements, and \n4.1.8 Additional requirements. \n5. Process \n5.1 The steel shall be made from any process. \n5.2 If a specific type of melting is required by the purchaser, \nit shall be stated on the purchase order. \n5.3 The primary melting may incorporate separate degas\u00ad\nsing or refining and may be followed by secondary melting, \nusing electroslag remelting or vacuum remelting. \n5.4 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. When \nsteel of different grades is sequentially strand cast, identifica\u00ad\ntion of the resultant transition material is required. The \nproducer shall remove the transition material by an established \nprocedure that positively separates the grades. \n6.
