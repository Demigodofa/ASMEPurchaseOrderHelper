An alternative method of \ndetermining yield strength may be used based on a total extension under load of 0.5 %. \n8 For some specific products, it may not be practicable to use a 2-in. or 50-mm gage length. The use of sub-size test specimens, when necessary, is permissible in \naccordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370 or Test Methods A1058. \nc Reduction of area does not apply on flat bars 3 /10 in. [4.76 mm) and under in thickness as this determination is not generally made in this product size. \n\u00b0The material shall be capable of meeting the required reduction of area where listed, but actual measurement and reporting of the reduction of area are not required unless \nspecified in the purchase order. \nE Or equivalent Rockwell hardness (HRB or HRC). \nF For extruded shapes of all Cr-Ni grades of Condition A, the yield strength shall be 25 ksi [170 MPa) min and tensile strength shall be 70 ksi [480 MPa] min. \nG For shapes having section thickness of \u00bd in. [12.5 mm] or less, 30% min. elongation is acceptable. \nH Material shall be capable of being heat treated to a maximum Brinell hardness of 250 HBW when oil quenched from 1750\u00b0F [950\u00b0C]. \n414 ",
