Refer to 7.3.1. \n8 Proof loads for nuts of larger dimensions or other thread series may be calculated by multiplying the thread stress area times the proof stress in the notes to Table 4 \nor Table S1 .2. The proof load for jam nuts shall be 46 % of the tabulated load. \nSS. Control of Product by Heat Number \nS5.1 When control of nuts by actual heat analysis is \nrequired and this supplementary requirement is specified, the \nmanufacturer shall identify the completed nuts in each ship\u00ad\nment by the actual heat number. When this supplementary \nrequirement is specified, a certificate including the results of \nthe actual production tests of each test lot together with the heat \nchemical analysis shall be furnished by the manufacturer. \nS6. Grain Size Requirements for Non H Grade Austenitic \nSteels Used Above 1000 \u00b0F \nS6.l For design metal temperatures above 1000 \u00b0F [540 \n\u00b0C], the material shall have a grain size of No. 7 or coarser as \ndetermined in accordance with Test Methods Ell2. The grain \nsize so determined shall be reported on the Certificate of Test. \nS7. Coating on Nuts \nS7.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the \npurchase order all information required by the coating facility. \nExamples of such information may include but are not limited \nto the following: \nS7.l.1 Reference to the appropriate coating specification \nand type, thickness, location, modification to dimensions, and \nhydrogen embrittlement relief. \n258 \nNorn S7.1-Modification of thread dimensions may result in loss of \nload carrying ability. \nS7.l.2 Reference to Specifications A153/A153M, B633, \nB695, B696, B766, F1941/F1941M, F2329/F2329M, or Test \nMethod F1940, or other standards. \nS8. Marking Coated Nuts \nS8.1 Nuts coated with zinc shall have ZN marked after the \ngrade symbol. Nuts coated with cadmium shall have CD \nmarked after the grade symbol. \nNorn SS.1-As an example, tbe marking for zinc-coated 2H bolting \ncomponents will now be 2HZN rather than 2H*. \nS9. Proof Load Testing \nS9.1 Proof load tests of nuts made to dimensions, thread \npitch, and configurations other than those covered in Table 3 or \nTable 4 shall be made using loads agreed upon between the \nmanufacturer and the purchaser. \nS10. 100 % Hardness Testing of Grade 2HM and 7M \nS 10.1 Each nut shall be tested for hardness by indentation \nmethod and shall meet the requirements specified in Table 2.
