Individual heats of steel are not identified in the finished \nproduct. \n8.2 When specified in the order, the manufacturer shall \nfurnish a test report certified to be the last completed set of \nmechanical tests for each stock size in each shipment. \n8.3 When additional tests are specified on the purchase \norder, a lot, for purposes of selecting test samples, shall consist \nof all material offered for inspection at one time that has the \nfollowing common characteristics: \n8.3.1 One type of item, \n8.3.2 One nominal size, and \n8.3.3 One nominal length of bolts and studs. \n8.4 From each lot, the number of tests for each requirement \nshall be as follows: \nNumber of Pieces in Lot Number of Samples \n800 and under 1 \n801 to 8 000 2 \n8 001 to 22 ooo 3 \nOver 22 000 5 \n8.5 If any machined test specimen shows defective machin\u00ad\ning it shall be discarded and another specimen substituted. \n8.6 Should any sample fail to meet the requirements of a \nspecified test, double the number of samples from the same lot \nshall be tested, in which case all of the additional samples shall \nmeet the specification. \n9. Test Methods \n9.1 Grades A and B bolts and studs shall be tested in \naccordance with Test Methods F606. \n9.2 Standard square and hex head bolts only shall be tested \nby the wedge tension method except as noted in 6.4. Fracture \nshall be in the body or threads of the bolt without any fracture \nat the junction of the head and body. Other headed bolts shall \nbe tested by the axial tension method. \n9.3 Speed of testing as detennined with a free running \ncrosshead shall be a maximum of 1 in./min for the tensile \nstrength tests of bolts. \n10. Inspection \n10.1 If the inspection described in 10.2 is required by the \npurchaser it shall be specified in the inquiry, order, or contract. \n10.2 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have \nfree entry to all parts of the manufacturer's works that concern \nthe manufacture of the material ordered.
