Scope \n1.1 This specification covers plate of a carbon steel or \nlow-alloy steel base to which is integrally and continuously \nbonded on one or both sides a layer of stainless chromium\u00ad\nnickel steel. The material is generally intended for pressure \nvessel use. \n1.2 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded \nas standard. The values given in parentheses are mathematical \nconversions to SI units that are provided for information only \nand are not considered standard. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA6/A6M Specification for General Requirements for Rolled \nStructural Steel Bars, Plates, Shapes, and Sheet Piling \nA20/A20M Specification for General Requirements for Steel \nPlates for Pressure Vessels \nA240/A240M Specification for Chromium and Chromium\u00ad\nNickel Stainless Steel Plate, Sheet, and Strip for Pressure \nVessels and for General Applications \nA370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Testing \nof Steel Products \nA480/A480M Specification for General Requirements for \nFlat-Rolled Stainless and Heat-Resisting Steel Plate, \nSheet, and Strip \nA578/A578M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic \nExamination of Rolled Steel Plates for Special Applica\u00ad\ntions \nA751 Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology for Chemi\u00ad\ncal Analysis of Steel Products \n2.2 Other Standards: \nASME Code Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX, \nWelding Qualifications \n3. Terminology \n3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.1.1 This material is considered as single-clad or double\u00ad\nclad corrosion-resisting chromium-nickel steel plate, depend\u00ad\ning on whether one or both sides are covered. \n3.1.2 alloy cladding-the stainless chromium-nickel steel \ncomponent of the composite plate. \n3.1.3 base metal (backing\" steel)-component to which the \nalloy cladding is applied, usually the greater percentage of the \ncomposite plate and usually consisting of carbon or low-alloy \nsteel. \n3.1.4 integrally and continuously bonded-the process by \nwhich the alloy cladding and base metal are brought together to \nform a metallurgical bond at essentially the entire interface of \nthe two metals by means other than those processes that do not \nproduce a homogeneous composite plate. \n4. Ordering Information \n380 \n4.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all \nrequirements that are necessary for mate1ial ordered under this \nspecification. Such requirements may include, but are not \nlimited to, the following: \n4.1.1 Quantity (weight or number of pieces). \n4.1.2 Cladding alloy specification, (UNS or ASTM Specifi\u00ad\ncation A240/ A240M and whether cladding is for conosion \nallowance only), \n4.1.3 Base metal specification. \n4.1.4 Bond integrity Class (1, 3, or 5). \n4.1.5 Dimensions including the minimum or nominal thick\u00ad\nness of the cladding alloy, and the backing steel, or of the total \ncomposite plate and if more or less restrictive thickness \ntolerances apply. \n4.1.6 Product analysis, if required (see Section 10). Specify \nwhether applicable to the cladding alloy, backing steel or both. ",
