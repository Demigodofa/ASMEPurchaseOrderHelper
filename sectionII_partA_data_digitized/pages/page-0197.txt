9.2.4 For eddy current testing, the calibration pipe shall 
contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following calibration standards to establish a minimum sensi­
tivity level for rejection. 
9.2.4.1 Drilled Hole-The calibration pipe shall contain 
three holes spaced 120° apart or four holes spaced 90° apart, 
sufficiently separated longitudinally to ensure separately dis­
tinguishable responses. The holes shall be drilled radially and 
completely through the pipe wall, care being taken to avoid 
distortion of the pipe while drilling. Dependent upon the 
nominal pipe size, the calibration pipe shall contain the 
following hole: 
NPS DN Diameter of Drilled Hole 
:51/2 :,; 15 0.039 In. [1.0 mm] 
> ½ :5 1¼ > 15 :,; 32 0.055 in. [1.4 mm] 
> 1¼:,; 2 >32:550 0.071 in. [1.8 mm] 
> 2:,; 5 > 50:,; 125 0.087 in. [2.2 mm] 
>5 > 125 0.106 in. [2.7 mm] 
9.2.4.2 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool or 
file with a ¼ in. [6 mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe. The notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater. 
9.2.4.3 Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or 
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the 
pipe axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to a depth not 
exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 
0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater. The length of the 
notch shall be compatible with the testing method. 
9.2.4.4 Compatibility-The calibration standards in the cali­
bration pipe shall be compatible with the testing equipment and 
the method being used. 
9.2.5 For flux leakage testing, the longitudinal calibration 
reference notches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a 
radial plane parallel to the pipe axis. For specified wall 
thicknesses less than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], outside and inside 
notches shall be used. For specified wall thicknesses equal to or 
greater than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], only an outside notch shall be 
used. The notch depth shall not exceed 12.5 % of the specified 
wall thickness, or 0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater. 
The notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25 mm], and the notch 
width shall not exceed the notch depth. Outside diameter and 
inside diameter notches shall be located sufficiently apart to 
allow separation and identification of the signals. 
9.2.6 Pipe containing one or more imperfections that pro­
duce a signal equal to or greater than the signal produced by the 
calibration standard shall be rejected or the area producing the 
signal shall be rejected. 
9.2.6.1 Test signals produced by imperfections that cannot 
be identified, or produced by cracks or crack-like 
imperfections, shall result in rejection of the pipe, unless it is 
repaired and retested. To be accepted, the pipe shall pass the 
same specification test to which it was originally subjected and 
the remaining wall thickness shall not have been decreased 
below that permitted by the specification. It shall be permis­
sible to reduce the outside diameter at the point of grinding by 
the amount so removed. 
9.2.6.2 It shall be permissible to evaluate test signals pro­
duced by visual imperfections in accordance with the provi­
sions of Section 12. A few examples of such imperfections are 
straightener marks, cutting chips, scratches, steel die stamps, 
stop marks, or pipe reducer ripple. 
9.2.7 The test methods described in Section 9 are not 
necessarily capable of inspecting the end portion of pipes. This 
condition is referred to as end effect. The length of the end 
effect shall be determined by the manufacturer and, if specified 
in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. 
10. Permissible Variations in Weight (Mass) and 
Dimensions 
10.1 Weight (Mass)-The weight (mass) of the pipe shall 
not vary more than± 10 % from its specified weight (mass), as 
derived by multiplying its measured length by its specified 
weight (mass) per unit length, as given in Table X2.2 or Table 
X2.3, or as calculated using the relevant equation in ASME 
B36.10M. 
No'!B 6-For pipe NPS 4 [DN 100] or smaller, the weight (mass) 
tolerance is applicable to the weights (masses) of the customary lifts of 
pipe as produced for shipment by the mill. For pipe larger than NPS 4 [DN 
100], where individual lengths are weighed, the weight (mass) tolerance is 
applicable to the individual lengths. 
10.2 Diameter-For pipe NPS 1 ½ [DN 40] or smaller, the 
outside diameter at any point shall not vary more than ± 1/64 in. 
[0.4 mm] from the specified outside diameter. For pipe NPS 2 
[DN 50] or larger, the outside diameter shall not vary more 
than ± 1 % from the specified outside diameter. 
10.3 Thickness-The minimum wall thickness at any point 
shall be not more than 12.5 % under the specified wall 
thickness. The minimum wall thickness on inspection shall 
conform to the requirements given in Table X2.4. 
11. End Finish 
11.1 If ordered with plain ends, the pipe shall be furnished 
to the following practice, unless otherwise specified. 
11.1.1 NPS 1½ [DN 40] or Smaller-Unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order, end finish shall be at the option 
of the manufacturer. 
11.1.2 Larger than NPS l½ [DN 40]: 
11.1.2.1 Pipe of standard-weight or extra-strong weight, or 
in wall thickness less than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], other than 
double extra-strong weight pipe, shall be plain-end beveled 
with ends beveled to an angle of 30°, +5°, -0°, measured from 
a line drawn perpendicular to the axis of the pipe, and with a 
root face of 1/16 in. ± 1/32 in. [1.6 mm ± 0.8 mm]. 
145 
11.1.2.2 Pipe with a specified wall thickness greater than 
0.500 in. [12.7 mm], and all double extra-strong weight pipe, 
shall be plain-end square cut. 
11.2 If ordered with threaded ends, the pipe ends shall be 
provided with a thread in accordance with the gaging practice 
and tolerances of ANSI B 1.20.1. For standard-weight pipe NPS 
6 [DN 150] or smaller, refer to Table X3.l for threading data. 
For standard-weight pipe NPS 8 [DN 200] or larger and all 
sizes of extra-strong weight pipe and double extra-strong 
weight pipe, refer to Table X3.2 for threading data. Threaded
