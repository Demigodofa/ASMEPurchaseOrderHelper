INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Forged or Rolled Alloy and Stainless Steel Pipe Flanges, 
Forged Fittings, and Valves and Parts for High-Temperature 
Service 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation Al82/Al82M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon ( e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers forged low alloy and stainless 
steel piping components for use in pressure systems. Included 
are flanges, fittings, valves, and similar parts to specified 
dimensions or to dimensional standards, such as the ASME 
specifications that are referenced in Section 2. 
1.2 For bars and products machined directly from bar or 
hollow bar (other than those directly addressed by this speci­
fication; see 6.4), refer to Specifications A479/A479M, A739, 
or A511/ A511M for the similar grades available in those 
specifications. 
1.3 Products made to this specification are limited to a 
maximum weight of 10 000 lb [4540 kg]. For larger products 
and products for other applications, refer to Specifications 
A336/A336M and A965/A965M for the similar ferritic and 
austenitic grades, respectively, available in those specifica­
tions. 
1.4 Several grades of low alloy steels and ferritic, 
martensitic, austenitic, and ferritic-austenitic stainless steels 
are included in this specification. Selection will depend upon 
design and service requirements. Several of the ferritic/ 
austenitic ( duplex) grades are also found in Specification 
A1049/ A1049M. 
1.5 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when 
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply 
only when specified individually by the purchaser in the order. 
1.6 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units 
and in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the

Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee 
A0l.22 on Steel Forgings and Wrought Fittings for Piping Applications and Bolting 
Materials for Piping and Special Purpose Applications.

applicable "M" specification designation (SI units), the mate­
rial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.7 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as the standard. Within the text, 
the SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
