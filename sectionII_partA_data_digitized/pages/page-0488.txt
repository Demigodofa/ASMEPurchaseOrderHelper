SA-302/SA-302M ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Manganese­
Molybdenum and Manganese-Molybdenum-Nickel 
1. Scope 
l. l This specification covers manganese-molybdenum and 
manganese-molybdenum-nickel alloy steel plates intended par­
ticularly for welded boilers and other pressure vessels. 
1.2 Plates under this specification are available in four 
grades having different strength levels as follows: 
Tensile Strength, 
ksi [MPa] Grade Type 
A 75-95 [515-655] manganese-molybdenum 
B 80-100 [550-690] manganese-molybdenum 
C 80-100 [550-690] manganese-molybdenum-nickel 
D 80-100 [550-690] manganese-molybdenum-nickel 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the chemical composition to meet the specified 
mechanical property requirements. 
J .4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
l .5 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. 
3.3 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates 
produced from coil means plates that have been cut to 
individual lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or 
is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of 
coils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, 
leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, 
heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for 
shipment, and certification.
