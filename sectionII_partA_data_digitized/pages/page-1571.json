Due to greater carbon content, SFS - 1020 is not \nas formable as SFS - 1010. \n4. Classification \n4.1 Hot-rolled steel sheet and steel strip is available in the \nfollowing designations: \n4.1.1 Commercial Steel (CS Types A, B, C, and D, as \nspecified in Table 1), \n4.1.2 Commercial Steel (CS Types A and B combined with \nchemistry grade in accordance with Specification A568/ \nA568M Table X2.3), \n4.1.3 Drawing Steel (DS Types A and B, as specified in \nTable 1), \n4.1.4 Drawing Steel (DS Types A and B combined with \nchemistry grade in accordance with Specification A568/ \nA568M Table X2.3, \n4.1.5 Commercial Steel Chemistry grade in accordance with \nSpecification A568/ A568M Table X2.1, with no type specified \n(CS - 1005, CS - 1008, CS - 1020, and so forth), \n4.1.6 Special Forming Steel (SFS), chemistry as specified in \nTable 1 with carbon & manganese limits in accordance with \nSpecification A568/A568M Tables X2 . l or X2.2 (examples: \nSFS - 1010, SFS - 1020, SFS - C 0.12-0.18 % & Mn \n0.50-0 .80 %). \n4.1.7 Structural Steel (SS grades 30[205], 33[230], 36[250] \nTypes 1 and 2, 40[275], 45[310] Types 1 and 2, 50[340], \n55[380], 60[410], and 70[480]. \n4.1.8 High-Strength Low-Alloy Steel (HSLAS, classes 1 \nand 2, in grades 45[310], 50[340], 55[380], 60[410], 65[450], \nand 70[480]. \n4.1.9 High-Strength Low-Alloy Steel with Improved Form\u00ad\nability (HSLAS-F grades 50[340], 60[410], 70[480], and \n80[550]). \n4.1.9.1 HSLAS-F steel has improved formability when \ncompared to HSLAS. The steel is fully deoxidized, made to a \nfine grain practice, and includes microalloying elements such \nas columbium, vanadium, and zirconium. The steel shall be \ntreated to achieve inclusion control. \n4.1.10 Ultra-High Strength (UHSS Types 1 and 2, in Grades \n90 [620] and 100 [690]). \n4.1.10.1 UHSS steel has increased strength compared with \nHSLAS-F. The steel is killed and made to a fine ferritic grain \npractice, and includes microalloying elements such as colum\u00ad\nbium (niobium), titanium, vanadium, molybdenum, and so \nforth. The steel shall be treated to achieve inclusion control. \nThe material is intended for miscellaneous applications where \nhigher strength, savings in weight, and weldability are impor\u00ad\ntant. Atmospheric corrosion resistance of these steels is equiva\u00ad\nlent to plain carbon steels. With copper specified, the atmo\u00ad\nspheric corrosion resistance is somewhat enhanced. \n4.1.11 When required for HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS \nsteels, limitations on the use of one or more of the microalloy \nelements shall be specified on the order. \n5. Ordering Information \n5.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the \npurchase order all ordering information necessary to describe \nthe required material. Examples of such information include, \nbut are not limited to, the following: \nTABLE 1 Chemical Composition \nr'or Hot Rolled Steel Sheet and Strip Designations CS, DS, and SFS \nComposition, % Heat Analysis \nElement maximum unless otherwise shown \nC Mn p s Al Si Cu Ni Cr 8 Mo V Cb/Nb 0 n \nCS Type AD,E,F.G 0.10 0.60 0.030 0.035 A A 0.20H 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 \nCS Type BF 0.02--0.15 0.60 0.030 0.035 A A 0.20H 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 \ncs Type cD,E,F,G 0.08 0.60 0.10 0.035 A A 0.20H 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 \nCS Type DF 0.10 0.70 0.030 0.035 A A 0.20H 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.008 \nDS Type A 0 ,E,G 0.08 0.50 0.020 0.030 0.01 min A 0.20 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 \nDS Type B 0.02--0.08 0.50 0.020 0.030 0.01 min A 0.20 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 \nSFS I 0.020 0.030 0.01 min A 0.20 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 \nA There is no specified limit, but the analysis shall be reported. \n8 Chromium is permitted, at the producer's option , to 0.25 % maximum when the carbon content is less than or equal to 0.05 %. \nc Columbium (Cb) and niobium (Nb) are considered interchangeable names for element 41 in the periodic table and both names are acceptable for use. \n0 Specify Type B to avoid carbon levels below 0.02 %. \nN B \nA A \nA A \nA A \nA A \nA A \nA A \nA A \nE For carbon levels less than or equal to 0.02 %, it is permissible to use vanadium, columbium, or titanium, or combinations thereof, as stabilizing elements at the producer's \noption.
