Scope \n1.1 This specification covers low-carbon age-hardening \nalloy steel plates for welded pressure vessels and piping \ncomponents. The specification covers nickel-copper\u00ad\nchromium-molybdenum-columbium (niobium) steel. \n1.2 Plates under this specification are available as follows: \n1.2.1 Available in Grade A, Class 3 only. \n1.2.1.1 Quenched and precipitation heat treated with a \nminimum specified tensile strength of 85 ksi for thinner plates \nand 75 and 70 ksi for thicker plates, with the minimum tensile \nstrength dependent upon the plate thickness. The maximum \nthickness of Grade A, Class 3 plates is limited only by the \ncapacity of the chemical composition and heat treatment to \nmeet the specified mechanical property requirements. \n1.3 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units \nand in SI units. However, unless the order specifies the \napplicable \"M\" specification designation (SI units), the mate\u00ad\nrial shall be furnished in inch-pound units. \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents. Therefore, each system must \nbe used independently of the other. Combining values from the \ntwo systems may result in nonconformance with this specifi\u00ad\ncation. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA20/A20M Specification for General Requirements for Steel \nPlates for Pressure Vessels \nA435/A435M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic \nExamination of Steel Plates \nA577/A577M Specification for Ultrasonic Angle-Beam Ex\u00ad\namination of Steel Plates \nA578/A578M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic \nExamination of Rolled Steel Plates for Special Applica\u00ad\ntions \n3. General Requirements and Ordering Information \n3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall \nconform to Specification A20/ A20M. These requirements out\u00ad\nline the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit\u00ad\nted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality, and repair of \ndefects, marking, loading, and ordering information. \n3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this \nspecification, certain supplementary requirements are available \nwhen additional control, testing, or examination is required to \nmeet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the \nlisted supplementary requirements in this specification and to \nthe detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. \n3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require\u00ad\nments of this specification shall prevail. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 The steel shall be killed and shall conform to the fine \naustenitic grain size requirement of Specification A20/A20M. \n5. Heat Treatment \n5.1 The plates shall be quenched in a liquid medium from a \ntemperature in the range from 1600 to 1700\u00b0F [870 to 930\u00b0C] \n1194 ",
