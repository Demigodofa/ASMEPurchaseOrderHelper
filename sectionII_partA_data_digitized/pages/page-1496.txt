17. Product Marking 
17.1 Castings shall be marked for material identifica­
tion with the grade symbols (WCB, WC9, CF8M, and so 
forth). In addition, master heat numbers, or serial numbers 
that are traceable to master heat numbers, shall be marked 
on all pressure-containing casting individually weighing 
50 lb [25 kg] or more. Pressure-containing castings 
weighing less than 50 lb [25 kg] shall be marked with 
either the master heat number or a lot number that will 
identify the casting as to the month in which it was poured. 
Marking shall be in such position as not to injure the 
usefulness of the casting. 
17.2 On casting for which impact property require­
ments are specified, stamped markings using low-stress 
stamps shall be on a raised pad when such pad can be 
made a part of the castings. 
17 .3 Castings shall be marked with the manufacturer's 
identification or symbols except when other provisions 
have been made between the manufacturer and purchaser.
