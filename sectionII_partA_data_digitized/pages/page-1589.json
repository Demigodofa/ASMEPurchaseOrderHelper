Bar coding \nshould be consistent with the (AIAG) standard prepared by the \nPrimary Metals Subcommittee of the AIAG Bar Code Project \nTeam. \n32. Packaging, Marking, and Loading \n32.1 When specified on the purchase order, packaging, \nmarking, and loading for shipment shall be in accordance with \nthe procedures of Practices A 700. \n33. Government Procurement \n33.1 Scale Free Tube: \n33.1.1 When specified in the contract or order, the following \nrequirements shall be considered in the inquiry contract or \norder, for agencies of the U.S. Government where scale-free \ntube is required. These requirements shall take precedence if \nthere is a conflict between these requirements and the product \nspecification. \n33.1.2 Tube shall be ordered to outside diameter (OD) and \nwall thickness. \n33.1.3 Responsibility for Inspection-Unless otherwise \nspecified in the contract or purchase order, the manufacturer is \nresponsible for the performance of all inspection and test \nrequirements specified. The absence of any inspection require\u00ad\nments in the specification shall not relieve the contractor of the \nresponsibility for ensuring that all products or supplies submit\u00ad\nted to the government for acceptance comply with all require\u00ad\nments of the contract. Sampling inspection, as part of the \nmanufacturing operations, is an acceptable practice to ascertain \nconformance to requirements; however, this does not authorize \nsubmission of known defective material, either indicated or \nactual, nor does it commit the government to accept the \nmaterial. Except as otherwise specified in the contract or \npurchase order, the manufacturer may use his own or any other \nsuitable facilities for the performance of the inspection and test \nrequirements unless disapproved by the purchaser at the time \nthe order is placed. The purchaser shall have the right to \nperform any of the inspections and tests set forth when such \ninspections and tests are deemed necessary to ensure that the \nmaterial conforms to the prescribed requirements. \n33.1.4 Sampling for Flattening and Flaring Test and for \nVisual and Dimensional Examination-Minimum sampling for \nflattening and flaring tests and visual and dimensional exami\u00ad\nnation shall be as follows: \nLot Size (pieces per lot) Sample Size \n2 to 8 Entire lot \n9 to 90 8 \n91 to 150 12 \n151 to 280 19 \n~1~WO ~ \n501 to 1200 27 \n1201 to 3200 35 \n3201 to 10 ooo 38 \n10 001 to 35 ooo 46 \nIn all cases, the acceptance number is zero and the rejection \nnumber is one. Rejected lots may be screened and resubmitted \nfor visual and dimensional examination. All defective items \nshall be replaced with acceptable items prior to lot acceptance. \n33.1.5 Sampling for Chemical Analysis-One sample for \nchemical analysis shall be selected from each of two tubes \nchosen from each lot. A lot shall be all material poured from \none heat. \n33.1.6 Sampling for Tension and Bend Test-One sample \nshall be taken from each lot. A lot shall consist of all tube of the \nsame outside diameter and wall thickness manufactured during \nan 8-h shift from the same heat of steel, and heat treated under \nthe same conditions of temperature and time in a single charge \nin a batch type furnace, or heat treated under the same \ncondition in a continuous furnace, and presented for inspection \nat the same time. \n33.1.7 Hydrostatic and Ultrasonic Tests-Each tube shall be \ntested by the ultrasonic (when specified) and hydrostatic tests. \n33.1.8 Tube shall be free from heavy oxide or scale. The \ninternal surface of hot finished ferritic steel tube shall be \npickled or blast cleaned to a free of scale condition equivalent \nto the CSa2 visual standard listed in SSPC-SP6. Cleaning shall \nbe performed in accordance with a written procedure that has \nbeen shown to be effective. This procedure shall be available \nfor audit. \n33.1.9 In addition to the marking in Specification A530/ \nA530M, each length of tube \u00bc in. outside diameter and larger \nshall be marked with the following listed information. Marking \nshall be in accordance with FED-STD-183 and MIL-STD- 792: \n(a) Outside diameter, wall thickness, and length (b) Heat or lot \nidentification number. \n33.1.10 Tube shall be straight to within the tolerances \nspecified in Table 7. \nTABLE 7 Straightness Tolerances \nSpecified OD (in.) \nUp to 5.0, incl \nSpecified wall \nthickness (in.) \nOver3%0Dto \n0.5, incl \nOver 5.0 to 8.0, incl Over 4 % OD to \n0.75, incl \nOver 8.0 to 12.75, incl Over 4 % OD to \n1.0, incl \nMaximum Maximum \ncurvature in any curvature in total \n3 ft (in.) length (in.) \n0.030 0.01 O x length, ft \n0.045 \n0.060 \n0.015 x length, ft \n0.020 x length, ft \n33.1.11 When specified, each tube shall be ultrasonically \nexamined in accordance with MIL-STD-271, except that the \nnotch depth in the calibration standard shall be 5 % of the wall \nthickness or 0.005 in., whichever is greater. Any tube that \nproduces an indication equal to or greater than 100 % of the \nindication from the calibration standard shall be rejected. \n33.1.12 The tube shall be free from repair welds, welded \njoints, laps, laminations, seams, visible cracks, tears, grooves, \nslivers, pits, and other imperfections detrimental to the tube as \ndetermined by visual and ultrasonic examination, or alternate \ntests, as specified. \n33.1.13 Tube shall be uniform in quality and condition and \nhave a finish conforming to the best practice for standard \nquality tubing. Surface imperfections such as handling marks, \nstraightening marks, light mandrel and die marks, shallow pits, \nand scale pattern will not be considered injurious if the \nimperfections are removable within the tolerances specified for \nwall thickness or 0.005 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is greater. The \n1535 ",
