The lot shall be \nconsidered acceptable if the sample nut(s) withstand(s) appli\u00ad\ncation of the cone proof load without failure. \n9. Dimensions \n9.1 Nuts shall be hexagonal in shape, and in accordance \nwith the dimensions for the hex or heavy hex series, as \nrequired, in ASME B 18.2.2 (for inch nuts) or ASME B \n18.2.4.6M (for metric nuts). Unless otherwise specified, the \nAmerican National Standard Heavy Hex Series shall be used \nand nuts shall be either double chamfered or have a machined \nor forged washer face, at the option of the manufacturer, and, \nconform to the angularity requirements of ASME B 18.2.2 (for \ninch nuts) or ASME B 18.2.4.6M (for metric nuts). \n9.2 Unless otherwise specified, threads shall be in accor\u00ad\ndance with ASME B 1.1 or ASME B 1.13M, and shall be \ngauged in accordance with ASME B 1.2 and ASME B 1.13M \nas described in 9.2.1 and 9.2.2. \n9.2.1 Nuts up to and including 1 in. nominal size shall be \nUNC Series Class 2B fit. Metric nuts up to and including M24 \nnominal size shall be coarse thread series tolerance 6H. \n9.2.2 Nuts over 1 in. nominal size shall be either UNC \nSeries Class 2B fit or 8 UN Series Class 2B fit. Unless \notherwise specified, the 8 UN series shall be furnished. Metric \nnuts over M24 nominal size shall be coarse thread series \ntolerance 6H. \nNoTE 1-Modification of thread dimensions may result in loss of load \ncan\u00b7ying ability. \n10. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n10.1 Nuts shall be free of defects and shall be good \ncommercial finish. \n10.2 If visible surface imperfections in size Y4 through \n1 \u00bd in. and M12 through M36 and in any grade other than \nGrade 8 become a matter of issue between the manufacturer \nand the purchaser, the cone proof load test described in 8.3 \nshall be employed. \n10.3 If a scale-free bright finish is required, this shall be \nspecified on the purchase order. \n11. Retests \n11.1 Provisions for retests by the purchaser and his repre\u00ad\nsentative are specified in Supplementary Requirement S2. \n12. Certification \n12.l In addition to the requirements of Specification A962/ \nA962M, the certification shall include the results of the \nchemical analysis, macroetch examination (Carbon and Alloy \nSteels Only), mechanical tests, and the minimum tempering \ntemperature for nuts of Grades 2H, 2HM, 3, 6, 6F, 7, 7M, and \n43. \n13. Product Marking \n13.1 In addition to the requirements of Specification A962/ \nA962M, nuts shall be legibly marked on one face with marking \nrepresenting the grade, type, and applicable manufacturing \nprocess shown in Table 7. Marking of wrench flats or bearing \nsurfaces is not permitted unless agreed upon between manu\u00ad\nfacturer and purchaser. \n14.
