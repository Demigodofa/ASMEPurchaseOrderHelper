[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the \nanvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 \nin. [2.55 mm]. Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness \nmeasurements. \nNorn 4--This table was constructed by multiplying the values in the \nstandard table by 0.50 and rounding to 2 decimal places using standard \nASTM practice. \nNorn 5-The thickness of material <50 mm wide shall be measured at \nmid-width. \nSpecified Width, \nmm \nOver \n1800 \n2000 \nThrough \n1800 \n2000 \nD \nSpecified Ordered Thickness, mm 8 \nThrough Over 0.4 Over 1.0 Over 1.2 Over 2.5 \n0.4 to 1.0, to 1.2, to 2.5, to 4.0, \nincl incl incl incl \nThickness Tolerances Over, mm, No Tolerance Underc \n0.05 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.15 \nD 0.08 0.10 0.15 0.18 \nD Q.15 0.15 Q.18 0.20 \nA 0.55 mm minimum thickness for high-strength low-alloy. \n8 The specified thickness range captions apply independent of whether the \nordered thickness is stated as a nominal or minimum. \nc The tolerances provided in the table are based on minimum thickness (tolerance \nover, no tolerance under).
