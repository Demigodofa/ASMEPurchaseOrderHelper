Such notes and footnotes, excluding those in tables \nand figures, do not contain any mandatory requirements. \n1.13 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with this \nspecification. \n1.14 This general requirements specification and the appli\u00ad\ncable product specification are expressed in both inch-pound \nunits and SI units; however, unless the order specifies the \napplicable \"M\" specification designation (SI units), the struc\u00ad\ntural product is furnished to inch-pound units. \n1.15 This standard does not purport to address all of the \nsafety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the \nresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro\u00ad\npriate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter\u00ad\nmine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. \n1.16 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
