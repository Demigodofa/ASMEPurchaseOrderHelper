5.4 Sampling for Product Analysis: 
5.4.1 To indicate adequately the representative composition 
_ ou ca§!_by_groduct analysis_,_ it is_general practice. to-select-­
samples to represent the steel, as fairly as possible, from a 
minimum number of pieces as follows: 3 pieces for lots up to 
15 tons incl, and 6 pieces for lots over 15 tons (see Practice 
E59). 
5.4.2 When the steel is subject to tension test requirements, 
samples for product analysis may be taken either by drilling 
entirely through the used tension test specimens themselves, or 
as covered in 5.4.3. 
5.4.3 When the steel is not subject to tension test 
requirements, the samples for analysis must be taken by 
milling or drilling entirely through the sheet in a sufficient 
number of places so that the samples are representative of the 
entire sheet or strip. The sampling may be facilitated by folding 
the sheet both ways, so that several samples may be taken at 
one drilling. Steel subjected to certain heating operations by 
the purchaser may not give chemical analysis results that 
properly represent its original composition. Therefore, users 
must analyze chips taken from the steel in the condition in 
which it is received from the steel manufacturer. 
5.5 Specimen Preparation-Drillings or chips must be taken 
without the application of water, oil, or other lubricant, and 
must be free of scale, grease, dirt, or other foreign substances. 
They must not be overheated during cutting to the extent of 
causing decarburization. Chips must be well mixed and those 
too coarse to pass a No. 10 sieve or too fine to remain on a 
No. 30 sieve are not suitable for proper analysis. Sieve size 
numbers are in accordance with Specification E 11. 
5.6 Test Methods-In case a referee analysis is required and 
agreed upon to resolve a dispute concerning the results of a 
chemical analysis, the procedure of performing the referee 
analysis must be in accordance with the latest issue of Test 
Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751, unless otherwise 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
6. Mechanical Properties 
6.1 The mechanical property requirements, number of 
specimens, test locations, and specimen orientation shall be in 
accordance with the applicable product specification. 
6.2 Unless otherwise specified in the applicable product 
specification, test specimens must be prepared in accordance 
with Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
6.3 Mechanical tests shall be conducted in accordance with 
Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
6.4 Bend tests where required shall be conducted in com­
pliance with Test Methods E290. 
6.5 To determine conformance with the product 
specification, a calculated value should be rounded to the 
nearest 1 ksi tensile strength and yield point or yield strength, 
and to the nearest unit in the right hand place of figures used in 
expressing the limiting value for other values in accordance 
with the rounding off method given in Practice E29. 
6.6 Structural sheet steels are commonly fabricated by cold 
bending. There are many interrelated factors that affect the 
ability of a given steel to cold form over a given radius under 
shop conditions. These factors include thickness, strength 
level, degree of restraint, relationship to rolling direction, _ 
chemistry, and microstructure. Each of the appropriate product 
specifications lists in the appendix the suggested minimum 
inside radius for cold bending. These radii should be used as 
minima for 90° bends. They presuppose "hard way" bending 
(bend axis parallel to rolling direction) and reasonably good 
shop forming practices. Where possible, the use of larger radii 
or "easy way" bends are recommended for improved perfor­
mance. 
6. 7 Fabricators should be aware that cracks may initiate 
upon bending a sheared or burned edge. This is not considered 
to be a fault of the steel but is rather a function of the induced 
cold-work or heat-affected zone. 
7. General Requirements for Delivery 
7.1 The products covered by this specification are produced 
to inch-pound or metric decimal thickness only and the 
appropriate thickness tolerances apply.
