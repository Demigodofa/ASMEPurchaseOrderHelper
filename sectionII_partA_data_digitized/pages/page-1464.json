  "text": "SA-961/SA-961M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 \n:finished part is insufficient to permit obtaining the smallest \nstandard subsize impact specimens, an impact test by the part \nmanufacturer will not be required. \n12.4 If the average impact energy value meets the product \nspecification requirements, but the energy value for one speci\u00ad\nmen is below the specified minimum value for individual \nspecimens, a retest is permitted. This shall consist of two \nimpact specimens from a location adjacent to, and on either \nside of, the specimen that failed. Each of the retested speci\u00ad\nmens must exhibit an energy value equal to or greater than the \nminimum average value required by the product specification. \n13. Hydrostatic Test Requirements \n13.1 Parts manufactured under this specification shall be \ncapable of passing a hydrostatic test compatible with the rating \nof the finished part. Such tests shall be conducted by the \nsupplier only when the hydrostatic test supplementary require\u00ad\nment in the product specification is invoked by the purchaser. \n14. Re~ork \n14.1 When one or more representative test specimens or \nretest specimens do not conform to the requirements specified \nin the product specification for the tested characteristic, the \nproduct may be reworked according to the following require\u00ad\nments: \n14.1.1 If previously tested in the unheat treated condition, \nthe product may be reworked by heat treatment, and subse\u00ad\nquently retested, in accordance with the product specification. \n14.1.2 If previously tested in the heat treated condition, the \nproduct may be reworked by reheat treatment, and subse\u00ad\nquently retested, in accordance with the product specification. \n15. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion \nProtection \n15.1 The parts shall conform to the dimensions, tolerances, \nand finish as specified on the purchaser's drawing or order and \nthe individual ASTM product specification. \n15.2 The :finished parts shall be cleaned to remove all scale \nand processing compounds prior to the final surface examina\u00ad\ntion. The cleaning process shall not injure the surface finish, \nmaterial properties, or the metallurgical structure. \n15.2.1 The surface finish shall allow the detection of imper\u00ad\nfections that can be disclosed by visual inspection. \n15.2.2 The cleaned parts shall be protected to prevent \nrecontamination. \n15.2.2.1 Exterior and interior surfaces of carbon, low and \nintermediate alloy steel :fittings shall have a corrosion protec\u00ad\ntive coating. Unless otherwise specified by the purchaser, the \ntype of surface protection shall be at the option of the \nmanufacturer. \n15.2.2.2 Stainless steel and nickel alloy :fittings need not be \ncoated. Unmachined surfaces of stainless steel fittings shall be \npassivated by exposure to an acid bath, or electropolished. \n15.2.3 Protective coatings on parts subsequently subjected \nto socket welds or butt welds shall be suitable for welding \nwithout removal of the coating. Threaded :fittings shall be \ncapable of installation without the removal of the coating. \n15.2.4 When specified in the purchase order, parts may be \nfurnished in the as-formed or as-forged condition. \n15.3 The parts shall be free of injurious imperfections as \ndefined below. At the discretion of the inspector representing \nthe purchaser, finished parts shall be subject to rejection if \nsurface imperfections acceptable under 15.5 are not scattered, \nbut appear over a large area. \n15.4 Depth of Injurious Imperfections-Selected typical \nlinear and other typical surface imperfections shall be explored \nfor depth. When the depth encroaches on the minimum \nspecified wall thickness of the finished part, such imperfections \nshall be considered injurious. \u2022 \n15.5 Imperfections Not Classified as Injurious-Surface \nimperfections not classified as injurious shall be treated as \nfollows: \n15.5.1 Seams, laps, tears, or slivers not deeper than 5 % of \nthe actual wall thickness at the point of interest or 1/16 in. [1.6 \nmm], whichever is less, are acceptable. If deeper, these \nimperfections require removal, and shall be removed by \nmachining or grinding. \n15.5.2 Mechanical marks or abrasions and pits shall be \nacceptable without grinding or machining provided the depth \ndoes not exceed 1/16 in. [1.6 mm]. If such imperfections are \ndeeper than 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] but do not encroach on the \nminimum wall thickness of the forging they shall be removed \nby machining or grinding to sound metal. \n15.5.3 The wall thickness at the point of grinding, or at \nimperfections not required to be removed, shall be determined \nby deducting the amount removed by grinding, from the \nnominal finished wall thickness of the part. In any case, the \nwall thickness shall not be less than the specified minimum \nvalue. \n16. Repair by Welding \n16.1 The purchaser may require the supplier to submit \nproposed weld repairs for approval by invoking the appropriate \nsupplementary requirement from the applicable product speci\u00ad\nfication in the purchase order. If the purchaser does not require \nprior approval of proposed weld repairs, these repairs shall be \npermitted at the discretion of the supplier. All weld repairs shall \nbe performed in accordance with the following limitations and \nrequirements. \n16.1.1 The welding procedure and welders shall be qualified \nin accordance with Section IX of the ASME Boiler and \nPressure Vessel Code. \n16.1.2 Defects shall be completely removed prior to weld\u00ad\ning by chipping or grinding to sound metal. Removal of these \ndefects shall be verified by magnetic particle inspection in \naccordance with Test Method A275/A275M or Guide E709 for \nthe ferritic, martensitic, or ferritic/austenitic grades, or by \nliquid penetrant inspection in accordance with Test Method \nE165/E165M for ferritic, martensitic, or austenitic grades. \n16.1.3 After repair welding, the welded area shall be ground \nsmooth to the original contour and shall be completely free of \ndefects as verified by magnetic particle or liquid penetrant \ninspection, as applicable. \n1406 ",
