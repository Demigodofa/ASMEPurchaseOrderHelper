When requested, this shall \nbe reported to the purchaser and shall conform to the require\u00ad\nments of Table 1. \n5.3 Product Analysis-An analysis may be made by the \npurchaser from finished wire representing each heat of steel. \nThe chemical composition thus determined, as to elements \nrequired or restricted, shall conform to the product analysis \nrequirements specified in Table 10 of Specification A510/ \nA510M. \n5.4 For referee purposes, Test Methods, Practices, and \nTerminology A751 shall be used. \n6. Mechanical Requirements \n6.1 Tension Test. \n6.1.1 Requirements-The material as represented by tension \ntest specimens shall conform to the requirements prescribed in \nTable 2. \n6.1.2 Number of Tests-One test specimen shall be taken \nfrom each end of every coil. \n6.1.3 Test Method-The tension test shall be made in \naccordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370, except \nthat the length L for evaluation of the elongation shall be \ncalculated from the following formula: \nL = 11.3-y'w.r \nwhere \nW = width of the wire, and \nT = thickness of the wire. \nThe length L shall be used to calculate the permanent \nelongation. The distance between the gage marks shall be \nmeasured to the nearest 0.004 in. (0.1 mm). Determine tensile \nproperties and permanent elongation as described in Test \nMethods and Definitions A370. \n6.1.4 Retest-If any test specimen exhibits obvious \ndiscontinuity, it may be discarded and another specimen \nsubstituted. \n7. Dimensions and Permissible Variations \n7 .1 The permissible variations in dimensions of the wire \nshall be as specified in Table 3, unless otherwise specified in \nthe ordering information. \n8. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance \n8.1 The wire shall be free of detrimental surface \nimperfections, tangles and sharp kinks. \n8.2 The wire shall conform to the dimensions, tolerances, \nand finish specified on the order or drawing. Welds are not \npermitted. \n8.3 When required, non-destructive examination shall be \ncarried out in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S 1. \n8.4 The wire as received shall be smooth and substantially \nfree from rust. No detrimental die marks or scratches may be \npresent. \n9. Inspection \n9.1 The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's inspector \nall reasonable facilities to satisfy him that the material is being \nproduced and furnished in accordance with this specification. \nAll tests and inspections may be made at the place of \nmanufacture prior to shipment and shall be so conducted as to \nnot interfere unnecessarily with the operation of the work. \n10. Certification and Reports \n10.1 The manufacturer shall furnish the required number, \nfrom the purchase order, of test reports to the purchaser. The \nfollowing items shall be reported. \n10.l.1 Heat number, \n10.1.2 Heat chemical analysis, \n10.1.3 Result of test of tensile properties, \n10.1.4 Reports of non-destructive tests, if required (S.l), \nand \n10.1.5 ASTM specification number, year of issue and revi\u00ad\nsion letter, if any. \nTABLE 2 Tensile Requirements \nTensile strength min. ksl Yield strength min, ksi Elongation \nThicknessA (MPa) (MPa) min % \nin.
