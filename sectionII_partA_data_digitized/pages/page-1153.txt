1400°F [690 to 760°C], held within that temperature range for 
a minimum of 1 h/in. [2.4 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case 
less than 15 min, and then water-quenched to below 300°F 
[150°C]. 
5.2.3 Tempering-The plates shall be reheated to a tempera­
ture within the range from 1150 to 1225°F [620 to 665°C], held 
within that temperature range for a minimum of 1 h/in. [2.4 
min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 15 min, and then 
water-quenched or air cooled to below 300°F [150°C]. 
5.3 Grade B, Procedure and Sequence: 
5.3.1 Hardening-The plates shall be heated to a tempera­
ture within the range from 1470 to 1600°F [800 to 870°C], held 
within that temperature range for a sufficient time to obtain 
uniform temperature throughout the plate thickness, and then 
quenched in a liquid medium. 
5.3.2 Intermediate Heat Treatment-The plates shall be 
reheated to a temperature within the range from 1200 to 
1330°F [650 to 720°C], held within that temperature range for 
a minimum of 1 h/in. [2.4 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case 
less than 15 min, and then water-quenched to below 300°F 
[150°C] for nominal plate thicknesses over 5/s in. [16 mm], or 
cooled in air or water-quenched to below 300°F [150°C] for 
nominal plate thicknesses of 5 /s in. [16 mm] and under. 
5.3.3 Tempering-The plates shall be reheated to a tempera­
ture within the range from 1020 to ll50°F [550 to 620°C], held 
within that temperature range for a minimum of 30 min/in. [1.2 
min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 15 min, and then 
water-quenched to below 300°F [150°C]. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements 
given in Table 1 unless otherwise modified in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement Sl7, Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized 
Steel, in Specification A20/ A20M. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7 .1 Tension Tests-The plates as represented by the tension 
test specimens shall confonn to the requirements given in 
Table 2. 
7.1.1 For nominal plate thicknesses of¾ in. [20 mm] and 
under, the 1 ½ in. [ 40 mm] wide rectangular specimen may be 
used for the tension test, and the elongation may be detennined 
in a 2 in. [50 mm] gage length that includes the fracture and 
that shows the greatest elongation. 
7.2 Impact Tests: 
7 .2.1 Charpy V-notch tests shall be made in accordance with 
the general requirements of Specification A20/ A20M. 
7 .2.2 The longitudinal axis of the test specimens shall be 
transverse to the final direction of rolling of the plate. 
7.2.3 Unless otherwise agreed, the plates shall be impact 
tested at the following temperatures:
