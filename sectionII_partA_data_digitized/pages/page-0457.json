[3.8 mm] incl \nnominal \nAWhen tubes as ordered require wall thicknesses\u00be in. [19 mm] or over, or an inside diameter 60 % or less of the outside diameter, a wider variation in wall thickness is \nrequired. On such sizes a variation in wall thickness of 12.5 % over or under will be permitted. \nFor tubes less than\u00bd in. [12.7 mm] in inside diameter which cannot be successfully drawn over a mandrel, the wall thickness may vary \u00b115 % from that specified. \n8 These tolerances apply to cut lengths up to and including 24 ft [7.3 m]. For lengths greater than 24 ft [7.3 m], the above over tolerances shall be increased by 1/a in. [3 \nmm] for each 10 ft [3 m] or fraction thereof over 24 ft, or\u00bd in. [13 mm), whichever is lesser. \nc Ovality provisions of 12.2 apply. \nfinished tubes. For tubes over 8 in. [203.2 mm] in outside \ndiameter, or tubes with wall thickness 3/s in. [9.52 mm] and \nover, the flattening test may be performed instead of the flange \ntest unless the flange test is specified in the purchase order. \n14.4 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests \nshall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot. \n14.5 When more than one heat is involved, the tension, \nflaring, flanging, and hardness test requirements shall apply to \neach heat. \n14.6 Reverse Flattening Test-For welded tubes, one re\u00ad\nverse flattening test shall be made on a specimen from each \n1500 ft [450 m] of finished tubing. \n15. Intergranular Corrosion Test \n15.1 If intergranular corrosion testing is specified in the \npurchase order, the test shall be made in accordance with \nPractices A763, using samples prepared as agreed upon be\u00ad\ntween the seller and the purchaser. \n16. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test \n16.1 Each tube, seamless or welded, shall be subjected to \nthe nondestructive electric test or the hydrostatic test. The type \nof test to be used shall be at the option of the manufacturer, \nunless otherwise specified in the purchase order. \n17. Product Marking \n17 .1 In addition to the marking desc1ibed in Specification \nA1016/A1016M, the marking shall indicate whether the tubing \nis seamless or welded. \n18.
