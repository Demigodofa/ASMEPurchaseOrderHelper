A Round test data to the nearest integral multiple of the values in this column. If the data value is exactly midway between two rounded values, round in accordance with 
AB.2.2. 
8 These units are not equivalent but the rounding occurs in the same numerical ranges for each. (1 ft,lbf = 1.356 J). 
c Round the mean diameter of the Brinell impression to the nearest 0.05 mm and report the corresponding Brinell hardness number read from the table without further 
rounding. 
A9. METHODS FOR TESTING STEEL REINFORCING BARS 
The testing requirements for steel reinforcing bars contained in this annex have been integrated into the relevant prod­
uct specifications. 
AlO. PROCEDURE FOR USE AND CONTROL OF HEAT-CYCLE SIMULATION 
Al0.1 Purpose 
Al0.1.1 To ensure consistent and reproducible heat treat­
ments of production forgings and the test specimens that 
represent them when the practice of heat-cycle simulation is 
used. 
Al0.2 Scope 
A 10 .2.1 Generation and documentation of actual production 
time-temperature curves (MASTER CHARTS). 
Al0.2.2 Controls for duplicating the master cycle during 
heat treatment of production forgings. (Heat treating within the 
essential variables established during Al.2.1.) 
Al0.2.3 Preparation of program charts for the simulator 
unit. 
Al0.2.4 Monitoring and inspection of the simulated cycle 
within the limits established by the ASME Code. 
Al0.2.5 Documentation and storage of all controls, 
inspections, charts, and curves.

Al0.4 Procedure 
Al0.4.1 Production Master Charts: 
Al0.4.1.1 Thermocouples shall be imbedded in each forg­
ing from which a master chart is obtained. Temperature shall be 
monitored by a recorder with resolution sufficient to clearly 
define all aspects of the heating, holding, and cooling process. 
All charts are to be clearly identified with all pertinent 
information and identification required for maintaining perma­
nent records. 
Al0.4.1.2 Thermocouples shall be imbedded 180° apart if 
the material specification requires test locations 180° apart. 
Al0.4.1.3 One master chart (or two if required in accor­
dance with Al0.4.3.1) shall be produced to represent essen­
tially identical forgings (same size and shape). Any change in 
size or geometry (exceeding rough machining tolerances) of a 
forging will necessitate that a new master cooling curve be 
developed. 
Al0.4.1.4 If more than one curve is required per master 
forging (180° apart) and a difference in cooling rate is 
achieved, then the most conservative curve shall be used as the 
master curve.
