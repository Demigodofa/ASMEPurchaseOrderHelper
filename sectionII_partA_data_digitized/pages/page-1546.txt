SA-999 /SA-999M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
22.3.7.3 Ultrasonic-For examination by the ultrasonic 
method, the nominal transducer frequency shall be 2.00 MHz 
or more and the nominal transducer size shall be 1.5 in. [38 
mm] or less. 
22.3.7.4 If the equipment contains a reject notice filter 
setting, this shall remain off during calibration and testing 
unless linearity can be demonstrated at the setting. 
22.3.8 Reference Standards: 
22.3.8.1 Reference standards of convenient length shall be 
prepared from a length of pipe of the same grade, size (NPS, or 
outside diameter and schedule or wall thickness), surface 
finish, and heat treatment conditions as the pipe to be exam­
ined. 
22.3.8.2 For Ultrasonic Testing, the reference ID and OD 
notches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes 
shown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The 
depth of each notch shall not exceed 12.5 % of the specified 
wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is 
the greater. The width of the notch shall not exceed twice the 
depth. Notches shall be placed on both the OD and ID surfaces. 
22.3.8.3 For Eddy-Current Testing, the reference standard 
shall contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following reference discontinuities: 
22.3.8.4 Drilled Hole-The reference standard shall contain 
three or more holes, equally spaced circumferentially around 
the pipe and longitudinally separated by a sufficient distance to 
allow distinct identification of the signal from each hole. The 
holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the pipe 
wall, with care being taken to avoid distortion of the pipe while 
drilling. One hole shall be drilled in the weld, if visible. 
Alternatively, the manufacturer of welded pipe is permitted to 
drill one hole in the weld and run the calibration standard 
through the test coils three times, with the weld turned at 120° 
on each pass. The hole diameter shall not exceed the following: 
NPS Designator Hole Diameter 
½ 0.039 in. [1.0 mm] 
above ½ to 1 ¼ 0.055 in. [1.4 mm] 
above 1 ¼ to 2 0.071 in. [1.8 mm] 
above 2 to 5 0.087 in. [2.2 mm] 
above 5 0.106 In. [2.7 mm] 
22.3.8.5 Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool 
or a file with a ¼-in. [6.4-mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed 
or milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the 
longitudinal axis of the pipe. Such a notch shall have a depth 
not exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the 
pipe or 0.004 in. [0.10 mm], whichever is the greater. 
22.3.8.6 Longitudinal Notch-A notch of 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] 
or less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to 
the pipe axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to have a depth 
not exceeding 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe 
or 0.004 in. [0.10 mm], whichever is the greater. 
22.3.8.7 More or smaller reference discontinuities, or both, 
may be used by agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
22.3.9 Standardization Procedure: 
22.3.9.1 The test apparatus shall be standardized at the 
beginning and end of each series of pipes of the same size 
(NPS or diameter and schedule or wall thickness), grade and 
heat treatment condition, and at intervals not exceeding 4 h. 
More frequent standardization may be performed at the manu­
facturer's option and may be required upon agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
22.3.9.2 The test apparatus shall also be standardized after 
any change in test system settings, change of operator, equip­
ment repair, or interruption due to power loss, process 
shutdown, or when a problem is suspected. 
22.3.9.3 The reference standard shall be passed through the 
test apparatus at the same speed and test system settings as the 
pipe to be tested. 
22.3.9.4 The signal-to-noise ratio for the reference standard 
shall be 2½ to 1 or greater. Extraneous signals caused by 
identifiable causes such as dings, scratches, dents, straightener 
marks, etc., shall not be considered noise. The rejection 
amplitude shall be adjusted to be at least 50 % of full scale of 
the readout display. 
22.3.9.5 If upon any standardization, the rejection ampli­
tude has decreased by at least 29 % (3 dB) of peak height from 
the last standardization, the pipe tested since the last calibration 
shall be rejected or retested for acceptance after the test 
apparatus settings have been changed, or the transducer(s), 
coil(s), or sensor(s) have been adjusted, and the test apparatus 
has been restandardized. 
22.3.10 Evaluation of Imperfections: 
22.3.10.1 Pipes producing a signal equal to or greater than 
the lowest signal produced by the reference discontinuities 
shall be identified and separated from the acceptable pipes. The 
area producing the signal may be reexamined. 
22.3.10.2 Such pipes shall be rejected if the test signals 
were produced by imperfections that cannot be identified or 
were produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. Such 
pipes may be repaired if such repair is permitted by the 
applicable product specification. To be accepted, a repaired 
pipe shall pass the same nondestructive test by which it was 
rejected, and it shall meet the minimum wall thickness require­
ments of the applicable product specification. 
22.3.10.3 If the test signals were produced by visual imper­
fections such as scratches, surface roughness, dings, straight­
ener marks, cutting chips, steel die stamps, stop marks, or pipe 
reducer ripple, the pipe is permitted to be accepted based upon 
visual examination provided that the depth of the imperfection 
is less than 0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 12.5 % of the specified wall 
thickness, whichever is the greater. 
22.3.10.4 Rejected pipe may be reconditioned and retested, 
provided that the wall thickness is not decreased to less than 
that required by the applicable product specification. The 
outside diameter at the point of grinding may be reduced by the 
amount so removed. To be accepted, retested pipe shall meet 
the test requirement. 
22.3 .10.5 If the imperfection is explored to the extent that it 
can be identified as non-rejectable, the pipe may be accepted 
without further test provided that the imperfection does not 
encroach on the minimum required wall thickness. 
23. Inspection 
23.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have 
entry at all times work on the contract of the purchaser is being 
performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's facilities that
