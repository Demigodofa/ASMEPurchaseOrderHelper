Asteel, as defined by the American Iron and Steel Institute, shall be considered to 
be alloy when the maximum of the range given for the content of alloying elements 
exceeds one or more of the following limits: Manganese, 1.65 %; silicon, 0.60 %; 
copper, 0.60 % or in which a definite range or a definite minimum quantity of any 
of the following elements is specified or required within the limits of the recognized 
field of constructional alloy steels: aluminum, chromium up to 3.99 %, cobalt, 
columbium, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, tungsten, vanadium, zirconium, or any 
other alloying elements added to obtain a desired alloying effect. 
TABLE 2 Hardness Requirements for Full-Size Fasteners

Over 2½ BC 235 311 22 33 
¼to2¼ BD 311 363 33 39 
Over 2½ BD 293 363 31 39 
values not less than the minimum nor more than the maximum 
hardness limits required in Table 2, as hardness is the only 
requirement. 
6.2 Fasteners 1 3/s in. in diameter or less for Grade BC and 
1 ¼ in. in diameter or less for Grade BD, other than those 
excepted in 6.1, shall be tested full size and shall conform to 
the tensile strength and either the proof load or the yield 
strength requirements in accordance with Table 3. 
6.3 Fasteners larger than 1 3/s in. in diameter for Grade BC 
and fasteners larger than 1 ¼ in. in diameter for Grade BD, 
other than those excepted in 6.1, shall preferably be tested full 
size and when so tested, shall conform to the tensile strength 
and either the proof load or yield strength requirements in 
accordance with Table 3. When equipment of sufficient capac­
ity for full-size testing is not available, or when the length of 
the fastener makes full-size testing impractical, machined 
specimens shall be tested and shall conform to the require­
ments in accordance with Table 4. In the event that fasteners 
are tested by both full-size and by the machined test specimen 
methods, the full-size test shall govern if a controversy 
between the two methods exists. 
6.4 For fasteners on which both hardness and tension tests 
are performed, acceptance based on tensile requirements shall 
take precedence in the event that there is controversy over low 
readings of hardness tests. 
7. Dimensions 
7.1 Bolts-Unless otherwise specified, the bolts shall be 
Hex Head with dimensions conforming to the latest issue of 
ASME Bl8.2.l. 
560 
7 .2 Studs-Studs shall have dimensions conforming to those 
specified by the purchaser. 
7.3 Threads: 
7.3.1 Unless otherwise specified, threads shall be the Uni­
fied National Coarse Thread Series as specified in Bl.I, and 
shall have Class 2 A tolerances. 
7.3.2 When specified, threads shall be the Unified National 
Fine Thread Series, 8-Pitch Thread Series for sizes over 1 in. or 
14-Pitch UNS on 1 in. size as specified in ANSI B 1.1 and shall 
have Class 2A tolerances. 
7.3.3 Unless otherwise specified, bolts and studs to be used 
with nuts or tapped holes that have been tapped oversize, in 
accordance with Specification A563, shall have Class 2A 
threads before hot dip or mechanically deposited zinc coating. 
After zinc coating, the maximum limit of pitch and major 
diameter may exceed the Class 2A limit by the following 
amount: 
¼

Specification A563. 
8. Workmanship 
8.1 Surface discontinuity limits shall be in accordance with 
Specification F788/F788M. 
9. Number of Tests 
9.1 Testing Responsibility: 
9.1.1 Each lot shall be tested by the manufacturer prior to 
shipment in accordance with the lot identification control 
quality assurance plan in 9.2 through 9.6. 
9.1.2 When fasteners are furnished by a source other than 
the manufacturer, the responsible party as defined in 12.1 shall 
be responsible for ensuring that all tests have been performed 
and the fasteners comply with the requirements of this speci­
fication. 
9.2 Purpose of Lot Inspection-The purpose of a lot inspec­
tion program is to ensure that each lot conforms to the 
requirements of this specification. For such a plan to be fully
