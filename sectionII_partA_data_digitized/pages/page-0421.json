If furnished in the normalized \nand tempered condition, the minimum tempering temperature \nshall be 1200 \u00b0P [650 \u00b0C], except T22 shall be tempered at \n1250 \u00b0P [676 \u00b0C] minimum. \n5.3.2 When grades Tl, Tia, Tlb, and T2 are cold finished, \nthe tubes may, at the option of the manufacturer, be heat treated \nafter the final cold-drawing pass at a temperature of 1200 \u00b0P or \nhigher, provided one of the heat treatments specified in 5.3.1 \nwas applied after welding. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements given in \nTable l. \n6.2 Product Analysis \n6.2.l An analysis of either one length of flat-rolled stock or \none tube shall be made on each heat. The chemical composition \nthus determined shall conform to the requirements given in \nTable 1. \n6.2.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of \ntwo additional lengths of flat-rolled stock or tubes shall be \nmade. Both retests for the elements in question shall meet the \nrequirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining \nmaterial in the heat or lot (See 8.1) shall be rejected or, at the \noption of the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or tube \nmay be individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat\u00ad\nrolled stock or tubes that do not meet the requirements of the \nspecification shall be rejected. \n7. Mechanical Requirements \n7 .1 Tensile Requirements \n7 .1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to \ntensile properties given in Table 2. \n7.1.2 Table 3 gives the computed minimum elongation \nvalues for each 1/.12-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. \nWhere the wall thickness lies between two values given in \nTable 3, the minimum elongation value shall be determined by \nthe following equation: \nComposition, % \nGrade Grade Grade \nT2 T11 T12 \n0.10-0.20 0.05-o.15 0.05-0.15 \n0.30-0.61 0.30--0.60 0.30-0.61 \n0.025 0.025 0.030 \n0.020 0.020 0.020 \n0.10-0.30 0.50-1.00 0.50 max \n0.44-Q.65 0.44-0.65 0.44-0.65 \n0.50-0.81 1.00-1.50 0.80-1.25 \nE = 48t + 15.00 [ E = l.87t + 15.00] \nwhere: \nE = elongation in 2 in.

Tension tests shall \nbe made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 \ntubes (See 8.2). \n7.3.2 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on \nspecimens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used \nfor the flange test, from each lot (See 8.1). \n7.3.3 Flange Test-One flange test shall be made on speci\u00ad\nmens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used for \nthe flattening test, from each lot (See 8.1). \n7.3.4 Reverse Flattening Test-One reverse flattening test \nshall be made on a specimen from each 1500 ft [450 m] of \nfinished tubing. \n7.3.5 Hardness Test-Brinell and Rockwell hardness tests \nshall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot (See \n8.2). \n7.3.6 Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Tests-Bach \ntube shall be subjected to either the hydrostatic or the nonde\u00ad\nstructive electric test. The purchaser may specify which is to be \nused. \n8. Sampling \n8.1 For flattening and flange requirements, the term lot \napplies to all tubes prior to cutting of the same specified outside \ndiameter and specified wall thickness that are produced from \nthe same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a \nbatch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the \nsame size and from the same heat that are heat treated in the \nsame furnace charge.
