A These designations refer to the latest issue of the respective specifications. 
1.2 In the case of conflict between a requirement of a 
product specification and a requirement of this general require­
ments specification, the product specification shall prevail. In 
the case of conflict between a requirement of the product 
specification or a requirement of this general requirements 
specification and a more stringent requirement of the purchase 
order, the purchase order shall prevail. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation (SI) of the product specification is specified in the 
order. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
