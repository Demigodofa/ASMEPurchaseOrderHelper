Additional Requirements \n1.1 General Requirements: \nAll \"see EN 10028-1\" shall be read as \"shall be according \nto EN 10028-1.\" \n1.2 Marking: \n[a) In addition to the marking requirements of this \nspecification, all products required to be marked and \nmaterial identification used on all documentation \nrequired by this specification are to be identified by \nthis SA/EN specification designation. \n(b) Plates that have been given the full heat treatment \nrequired by para. 8.2.1 or 8.2.2 shall be marked by the \nparty performing the heat treatment with the letters \ndesignating the applicable heat treatment condition in \nTable 3 of EN 10028-2 following the stamped steel \nname or number. \n[c) Plates for which normalizing has been replaced by \nnormalizing rolling as permitted by para. 8.2.2 shall be \nmarked \"+NR\" instead of \"+N.\" \n[ d) Plates that are not heat treated but are qualified on \nthe basis of heat treated specimens per para. 8.2.3 shall be \nstamped with letter \"G\" following the stamped specifica\u00ad\ntion designation. \n[e) When such plates are subsequently heat treated, \nthey shall be marked, by the party that performed the \nheat treatment, as required by (b) above following the \nrequired stamped specification designation. \n1.3 Delivery Condition: \nNormalizing shall not be replaced by normalizing \nrolling for plates of steel Grade 16Mo3. \n1.4 Chemical Composition: \nThe requirements of paras. 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 on heat \nanalysis, and of paras. 7.2.3 and 7.2.4 on product analysis, \nof SA-20/SA-20M shall apply. \n1.5 Tension Tests: \nFor quenched and tempered plates one tension test \nshall be taken from each end of the heat treated plate. \nThe gage length of the tension test specimens shall be \ntaken at least 1 T from any heat treated edge, where T \nis the thickness of the plate, and shall be at least 1/z in. \n(12.5 mm) from flame cut or heat-affected-zone surfaces. \n1.6 Impact Test Sampling: \nDeviation from the requirement for preparation of test \npieces for impact testing in EN 10028-1 shall not be \npermitted in SA/EN 10028-2. \n1. 7 Steelmaking Process: \nThe ratio of reduction of thickness from a strand-cast \nslab to plate shall be at least 3.0:1. \n1.8 Quality: \nAll surface imperfections, the removal of which will \nreduce the plate thickness below its permissible \nminimum, shall be cause for rejection of the plate; \nhowever by agreement with the purchaser, the metal \nso removed may be replaced with weld metal. \n1572 ",
