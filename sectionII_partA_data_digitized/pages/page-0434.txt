FIG. 1 Test Specimen and Method of Making Shear Test of Clad 
Plate 
cladding thickness for shear testing shall be 0.075 in. (1.9 mm), 
exclusive as ordered. Testing for shear strength for clad plates 
with minimum cladding thickness of 0.075 in. (1.9 mm) or less 
shall be permitted upon agreement between the purchaser and 
the manufacturer. 
7.2.2 Bond Strength-As an alternative to the shear strength 
test provided in 7.2.1, or when agreed upon by the purchaser 
and the manufacturer, or both, three bend tests shall be made 
with the alloy cladding in compression to determine the quality 
of the bond. These bend tests shall be made in the manner of 
the tension tests indicated in Fig. 2 and shall be bent through an 
angle of 180° to the bend diameters provided for in either

NoTE 1-When necessary, it is permissible to use a narrower specimen, 
but in such a case the reduced portion shall be not less than 1 in. in width. 
NoTE 2-Punch marks for measuring elongation after fracture shall be 
made on the flat or on the edge of the specimen and within the parallel 
section; either a set of nine punch marks I in. apart, or one or more sets 
of 8-in. punch marks may be used. 
NoTE 3-The dimension t is the thickness of the test specimen as 
provided for in the applicable material specifications. 
FIG. 2 Standard Rectangular Tension Test Specimen with 8-in. 
Gage Length 
Specification A6/A6M or Specification A20/A20M, Appendix 
X4 or equivalent, as applicable. At least two of the three tests 
shall show not more than 50 % separation on both edges of the 
bent portion. Greater separation shall be cause for rejection. 
7.3 Methods and practices relating to mechanical testing 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with the 
Test Methods and Definitions of A370. 
8. Number of Tests and Retests 
8.1 One or more tension tests, as required by the specifica­
tions for the base metal and when specified, one shear test or 
three bond bend tests shall be made, representing each plate as 
rolled. Each specimen shall be in the p.nal condition of heat 
treatment required for the plate, including any SPWHT if 
required. 
8.2 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws, it may be discarded and another specimen 
substituted. 
9. Test Specimens 
9 .1 The tension test specimens from plate shall conform to 
the requirements prescribed in the specifications for the base 
metal. 
9.2 Bend test specimens for the alternative bond strength 
tests, shall be taken at right angles to its longitudinal axis. 
382 
9.3 When required by the purchaser, the shear test specimen 
should be taken near a top or bottom corner of the plate as 
rolled, parallel to its longitudinal axis, or other location that is 
representative of the final product. 
9.4 For plates 1 ½ in. (38 mm) and under in thickness, 
tension test specimens shall be the full thickness of the 
material, except as specified in 7 .1.2 and 7.1.3. 
9.5 For plates over 1 ½ in. (38 mm) in thickness, tension 
tests shall be of the form shown in Fig. 3 and shall be of all 
base steel conforming to the requirements of the specification 
for the base steel. 
9.6 The bend test specimen used for bond strength determi­
nation shall be 1 ½ in. (38 mm) wide by not more than ¾ in. 
(19 mm) in thickness and shall be machined to the form and 
dimensions shown in Fig. 2, or may be machined with both 
edges parallel. In reducing the thickness of the specimen, both 
the alloy cladding and the base steel shall be machined so as to 
maintain the same ratio of clad metal to base steel as is 
maintained in the plate, except that the thickness of the clad 
metal need not be reduced below Vs in. (3.1 mm). The sides of 
the bend test specimen used for bond strength determination 
may have the corners rounded to a radius not over 1/16 in. (1.6 
mm) for plates, 2 in. (50 mm) and under in thickness, and not 
over Vs in. (3.1 mm) for plates over 2 in. (50 mm) in thickness. 
10. Product Analysis 
10.1 Product analysis may be required for the cladding alloy 
on finished product. Chemical analysis may be accomplished 
by wet chemical or instrumental procedures. If wet chemical 
procedures are used, millings may be taken only when the 
composite plate thickness is sufficient to permit obtaining
