ALLOY DESIGNATIONS FOR CAST \nSTAINLESS STEELS \nXl.1 Cast stainless steels are usually specified on the \nbasis of composition using the alloy designation system \nestablished by the Alloy Casting Institute (ACI). The ACI \ndesignations, for example, CF8M, have been adopted by \nASTM and are preferred for cast alloys over the designa\u00ad\ntions used by the American Iron and Steel Institute for \nsimilar wrought steels. \nXl.2 This nomenclature system has served successfully \nto accommodate changes in old alloys and to designate \nnew ones. \nX X 00 X X X \nService Classification T \nLetter _________ __,_ \nTernary Diagram Location \nLetter _________ _. \nCarbon Content Number------~ \nSpecial Elements Letter III \nXl.2.1 Service Classification Letter - The first letter \nof the cast stainless steel designation system identifies the \nintended service application of the alloy. The letter Cindi\u00ad\ncates corrosion-resistant service, and the letter H indicates \nthe heat-resistant service at and above 1200\u00b0F [649\u00b0C]. \nXl.2.2 Ternary Diagram Location Letter- The second \nletter indicates the approximate location of the nickel and \nchromium contents of the alloy grade on the FeCrNi ternary \ndiagram shown in Fig. Xl.1. \nXl.2.3 Carbon Content Number- For C service classi\u00ad\nfications, this single or dual digit numeral represents the \nmaximum carbon content in units of 0.01 %. For H service \nclassifications, this number represents the midpoint of the \nrange of carbon content in terms of 0.01 % with a \n\u00b10.05% limit. \nXl.2.4 Special Elements Letter-Additional letters fol\u00ad\nlowing the numeral represent special chemical elements in \nthe alloy grade, such as M for molybdenum, C for colum\u00ad\nbium, Cu for copper, W for tungsten. There are two excep\u00ad\ntions; the letter A indicates Controlled Ferrite, and the \nletter F indicates Free Machining. \nXl.3 In Fig. Xl.1, unlettered Ni-Cr ranges are associ\u00ad\nated with the nearest lettered location. They may be the \nresult of differences between corrosion and heat-resistant \ntypes, or because of the influence of additional elements, \nfor example, the precipitation hardening grade CB- 7Cu-1 \nand CB-7Cu-2. \nX2. WROUGHT ALLOYS SIMILAR TO \nCASTING ALLOYS IN SPECIFICATIONS \nA 494/A 494M, A 743/A 743M, A 744/A 744M, \nA 747/A 747M, AND A 890/A 890M \nX2.1 Table X2.1 is provided for the user of the above \nlisted specifications as an aid in selecting cast alloys that \nare similar in chemical composition to wrought alloys. It \nis not intended to imply that the cast alloy would have the \nsame mechanical, physical or corrosion properties as the \nindicated wrought alloy. \nX3. ADDITION OF NEW GRADES TO \nPRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS COVERED BY \nA 781/A 781M \nX3.1 Information required for the inclusion of new \nmaterial grades in product specifications covered by \nA 781/A 781M: \nI. At least one user should support the request. \n2. A set of data from ten production heats, this data \nshould include: \nX3.1.1 Chemical composition. \nX3.1.2 Mechanical properties as applicable to the \nproduct specification being cited. These may include but \nare not limited to the following: \nX3.1.2.1 Ultimate tensile strength, \nX3.1.2.2 Yield strength, \nX3.1.2.3 Reduction in area, \nX3.1.2.4 Elongation, and \nX3.1.2.5 Impact properties (Charpy V). \nX3.2 The test coupon size from which the test pieces \nare removed should be stated for each test. \nX3.2.1 Heat treatment requirements. \nX3.2.2 Weld procedure ( welding should be carried \nout using commercially available consumables). \n1267 ",
