Xl. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF 
CASTINGS 
Xl.1 The mechanical properties of iron castings are 
influenced by the cooling rate during and after solidifica­
tion, by chemical composition, by heat treatment, by the 
design of the casting, by the design and nature of the mold, 
by the location and effectiveness of gates and risers, and 
by certain other factors. 
Xl.2 The cooling rate in the mold and, therefore, the 
properties developed in any particular section are influ­
enced by the presence of cores, chills and chaplets, changes 
in section thickness, and the existence of bosses, projec­
tions, and intersections, such as junctions of ribs and 
bosses. Because of the complexity of the interactions of 
these factors, no precise quantitative relationship can be 
stated between the properties of the iron in various loca­
tions of the same casting or between the properties of a 
casting and those of a test specimen cast from the same 
iron. When such a relationship is important and must be 
known for a specific application, it may be more closely 
ascertained by appropriate experimentation. 
Xl.3 When reliable information is unavailable on the 
relationship between properties in a casting and those in 
a separately cast test specimen, and where experimentation 
would be unfeasible, the size of the test casting should be 
so selected as to approximate the thickness of the main or 
controlling section of the casting.
