6.1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements given 
in Table 2. 
6.1.2 Table 3 gives the computed minimum elongation 
values for each ½2-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. 
Where the wall thickness lies between two values shown 
above, the minimum elongation value shall be determined by 
the following equation: 
E = 48t+ 15.00[E 0 = L87t+l5.00] (l) 
where: 
E = elongation in 2 in. [50 mm],%, and, 
= actual thickness of specimen, in. [mm]. 
6.2 Hardness Requirements-The tubes shall have a hard­
ness not exceeding the values given in Table 4. 
6.3 Number of Tests 
6.3.1 Tension Test-One tension test shall be made on a 
specimen for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall 
be made on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 
tubes (See 7 .2) 
6.3.2 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used 
for the flaring test, from each lot (See 7.1) 
6.3.3 Flaring Test-One flaiing test shall be made on 
specimens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used 
for the flattening test, from each lot (See 7.1) 
6.3.4 Hardness Test-Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests 
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot (See 
7.2)

7. l Flattening, Flaring, and Product Analysis-For 
flattening, flaring, and product analysis requirements, the term 
lot applies to all tubes prior to cutting of the same nominal size 
and wall thickness that are produced from the same heat of 
steel. When final heat treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot 
shaU include only those tubes of the same size and from the 
same heat that are heat treated in the same furnace charge. 
When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, the 
number of tubes of the same size and from the same heat in a 
lot shall be determined from the size of the tubes given in Table 
5. 
7.2 Tension and Hardness Tests-For tension and hardness 
tests, the term lot applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the 
same nominal diameter and wall thic.kness that are produced 
from the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a 
batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the 
same size and the same heat that are heat treated in the same 
furnace charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous 
furnace, a lot shall include all tubes of the same size and heat, 
heat treated in the same furnace at the same temperature, time 
at heat, and furnace speed.
