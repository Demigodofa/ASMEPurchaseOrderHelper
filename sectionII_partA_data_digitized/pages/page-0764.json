The test blocks shall be heat \ntreated in the same manner as the casting represented. \n11.3 Tension test specimens shall be machined to the form \nand dimensions of the standard round 2-in. [50-mm] gage \nlength specimens shown in Fig. 6 of Test Methods and \nDefinitions A370. \n12. Hydrostatic Test \n12.1 Each length of pipe shall be hydrostatically tested in \naccordance with Specification A999/ A999M. \n12.2 When agreed to between the manufacturer and the \npurchaser and so stated in the order, the hydrostatic test may be \ndefe1Ted and shall be performed later by the purchaser.

Visual Inspection \n13 .1 The surface of the casting shall be free from cracks and \nhot tears as determined by visual examination. Other surface \nimperfections shall be judged in accordance with visual accep\u00ad\ntance criteria which may be specified in the order. \n14. Rework and Retreatment \n14. l Defects as defined in Section 13 shall be removed and \ntheir removal verified by visual inspection of the resultant \ncavities. Defects that are located by inspecting with supple\u00ad\nmentary requirements S6, S7, SS, or S9 shall be removed or \nreduced to an acceptable size. \n14.2 If removal of the defect does not infringe upon the \nminimum wall thickness, the depression may be blended \nuniformly into the surrounding surface. \n14.3 If the cavity resulting from defect removal infringes \nupon the minimum wall thickness, weld repair is permitted \nsubject to the purchaser's approval. The composition of the \nweld rod used shall be suitable for the composition of the metal \nbeing welded. \n14.3.1 Only welders and procedures qualified in accordance \nwith ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX, shall \nbe used. All repair welds will be inspected to the same quality \nstandards used to inspect the casting. \n14.4 Local or full heat treatment in accordance with tem\u00ad\npering temperatures specified in 5.1 shall follow welding.
