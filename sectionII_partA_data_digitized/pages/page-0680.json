METHODS FOR TESTING STEEL REINFORCING BARS \nThe testing requirements for steel reinforcing bars contained in this annex have been integrated into the relevant prod\u00ad\nuct specifications. \nAlO. PROCEDURE FOR USE AND CONTROL OF HEAT-CYCLE SIMULATION \nAl0.1 Purpose \nAl0.1.1 To ensure consistent and reproducible heat treat\u00ad\nments of production forgings and the test specimens that \nrepresent them when the practice of heat-cycle simulation is \nused. \nAl0.2 Scope \nA 10 .2.1 Generation and documentation of actual production \ntime-temperature curves (MASTER CHARTS). \nAl0.2.2 Controls for duplicating the master cycle during \nheat treatment of production forgings. (Heat treating within the \nessential variables established during Al.2.1.) \nAl0.2.3 Preparation of program charts for the simulator \nunit. \nAl0.2.4 Monitoring and inspection of the simulated cycle \nwithin the limits established by the ASME Code. \nAl0.2.5 Documentation and storage of all controls, \ninspections, charts, and curves. \nAl0.3 Referenced Documents \nAl0.3.1 ASME Standards: \nAl0.3.1.1 ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section \nIII, latest edition. \n630 \nAl0.3.1.2 ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section \nVIII, Division 2, latest edition. \nAl0.4 Procedure \nAl0.4.1 Production Master Charts: \nAl0.4.1.1 Thermocouples shall be imbedded in each forg\u00ad\ning from which a master chart is obtained. Temperature shall be \nmonitored by a recorder with resolution sufficient to clearly \ndefine all aspects of the heating, holding, and cooling process. \nAll charts are to be clearly identified with all pertinent \ninformation and identification required for maintaining perma\u00ad\nnent records. \nAl0.4.1.2 Thermocouples shall be imbedded 180\u00b0 apart if \nthe material specification requires test locations 180\u00b0 apart. \nAl0.4.1.3 One master chart (or two if required in accor\u00ad\ndance with Al0.4.3.1) shall be produced to represent essen\u00ad\ntially identical forgings (same size and shape). Any change in \nsize or geometry (exceeding rough machining tolerances) of a \nforging will necessitate that a new master cooling curve be \ndeveloped. \nAl0.4.1.4 If more than one curve is required per master \nforging (180\u00b0 apart) and a difference in cooling rate is \nachieved, then the most conservative curve shall be used as the \nmaster curve.
