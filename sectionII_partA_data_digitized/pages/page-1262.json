[100 mm]. \nENot more than one specimen from a set may be below this value. \n6.5 Orientation-For upset disk forgings, the longitudinal \naxis of all test specimens shall be oriented in the tangential or \nradial direction. For all other forgings, the longitudinal axis of \nthe specimens shall be oriented in the direction of maximum \nworking of the forging, or as agreed between manufacturer and \npurchaser. \n6.6 Number of Tests: \n6.6.1 For forgings weighing 1000 lb [455 kg] or less, as heat \ntreated but not exceeding 80 in. [2030 mm] in length, exclud\u00ad\ning test material, one tension test and one set of impact tests \n(three specimens) shall be taken to represent each heat in each \nheat-treatment charge. This testing shall be repeated at the \nopposite end of the same test forging, if the heat-treated length \nexcluding test material exceeds 80 in. [2030 mm]. When heat \ntreatment is performed in continuous-type furnaces with suit\u00ad\nable temperature control and equipped with recording pyrom\u00ad\neters so that complete heat-treatment records are available, a \nheat-treatment charge shall be considered as any continuous \nrun not exceeding 8 h in duration. \n6.6.2 Forgings weighing over 1000 lb [455 kg] but not over \n5000 lb [2270 kg] as heat treated and not over 80 in. [2030 \nmm] in length excluding test material, one tension test and one \nset of three impact tests shall be removed from each forging. \nWhen the length of the forging exceeds 80 in. [2030 mm] this \ntesting shall be repeated at the opposite end of the forging. \n6.6.3 Forgings exceeding 5000 lb [2270 kg] and not over 80 \nin. [2030 mm] in length, excluding test material, shall have one \ntension test and one set of three impact tests removed from \neach of two locations, 180\u00b0 apart. For forgings with lengths \nexceeding 80 in. [2030 mm] this testing shall be repeated at the \nopposite end of the forging. Supplementary Requirement S6 is \napplicable for forgings intended for use under the rules of \nSection VIII, Division 3 of the ASME Boiler and Pressure \nVessel Code. \n7. Nondestructive Examination Requirements \n7.1 Ultrasonic Examination: \n7.1.1 Forgings shall be ultrasonically examined in accor\u00ad\ndance with the procedures of Practice A388/A388M. \n7.1.1.1 Straight-Beam Examination: (a)Unless otherwise \nspecified, the back-reflection method of tuning shall be used in \naccordance with Practice A388/A388M. \n(b) In addition to the reportable conditions of Practice \nA388/A388M, indications exceeding the resultant back\u00ad\nreflection shall be recorded. \n(c) A forging shall be unacceptable when one or more \nreflections are present producing indications accompanied by a \ncomplete loss of back-reflection, not attributable to nor asso\u00ad\nciated with the geometric configuration. For this purpose, a \nback-reflection of less than 5 % of full screen height shall be \nconsidered complete loss of back-reflection. \n7.1.1.2 Angle-Beam Examination: (a) Calibration notches \nshall be cut into the inside diameter and outside diameter \nsurfaces in accordance with Practice A388/A388M. \n(b) A forging that contains a discontinuity which results in an \nindication exceeding the amplitude of the reference line is \nsubject to rejection. \n(c) The report of the ultrasonic test shall be in compliance \nwith Practice A388/A388M. \n(d) Additional nondestructive examination or trepanning \nmay be employed to resolve questions of interpretation of \nultrasonic indications. The manufacturer shall accept respon\u00ad\nsibility for injurious defects that will not be removed in final \nmachining. \n7 .2 Magnetic Particle Examination: \n7 .2.1 Each forging shall be examined by magnetic particle \nmethods described in Practice A275/A275M. Acceptance and \nrejection standards shall be as follows: Only indications with \nmajor dimensions greater than \u00bd6 in. [1.6 mm] shall be \nconsidered relevant. The following relevant indications are \nunacceptable: \n7.2.1.1 Any linear indications greater than 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] \nlong for materials less than 5/s in. [16 mm] thick; greater than \n1/s in. [3.2 mm] long for materials from 5/s in. to under 2 in. [50 \n1178 ",
