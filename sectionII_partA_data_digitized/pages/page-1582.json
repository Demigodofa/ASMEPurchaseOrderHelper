Chemical Composition \n6.1 Chemical Analysis-Samples for chemical analysis, and \nmethod of analysis, shall be in accordance with Test Methods, \nPractices, and Terminology A751. \n6.2 Heat Analysis-An analysis of each heat of steel shall be \nmade by the steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of \nthe elements specified. If secondary melting processes are \nemployed, the heat analysis shall be obtained from one \nremelted ingot or the product of one remelted ingot of each \nprimary melt. The chemical composition thus determined, or \nthat determined from a product analysis made by the tubular \nproduct manufacturer, shall conform to the requirements speci\u00ad\nfied in the product specification. \n6.2.1 For steels ordered under product specifications refer\u00ad\nencing this specification of general requirements, the steel shall \nnot contain an unspecified element, other than nitrogen for \nstainless steels, for the ordered grade to the extent that the steel \nconforms to the requirements of another grade for which that \nelement is a specified element having a required minimum \ncontent. For this requirement, a grade is defined as an alloy \ndescribed individually and identified by its own UNS designa\u00ad\ntion in a table of chemical requirements within any specifica\u00ad\ntion listed within the scope as being covered by this specifi\u00ad\ncation. \n6.3 Product Analysis-Product analysis requirements and \noptions, if any, shall be as contained in the product specifica\u00ad\ntion. \n7. Tensile Properties \n7 .1 The material shall conform to the tensile property \nrequirements prescribed in the individual product specification. \n7 .2 The yield strength, when specified, shall be determined \ncorresponding to a permanent offset of 0.2 % of the gauge \nlength or to a total extension of 0.5 % of the gauge length under \nload. \n7.3 If the percentage of elongation of any test specimen is \nless than that specified and any part of the fracture is more than \n\u00be in. [19.0 mm] from the center of the gauge length, as \nindicated by scribe marks on the specimen before testing, a \nretest shall be allowed. \n8. Standard Mass per Unit Length \n8.1 The calculated mass per foot, based upon a specified \nminimum wall thickness, shall be determined by the following \nequation (see Note 1): \nW= C(D- t)t (I) \nwhere: \nC = 10.69 [0.0246615], \nW = mass per unit length, lb/ft [kg/m], \nD = specified outside diameter, in. [mm], and \nt = specified minimum wall thickness, in. [mm]. \nNorn 1-The calculated masses given by Eq I are based on the masses \nfor carbon steel tubing. The mass of tubing made of ferritic stainless steels \nmay be up to about 5 % less, and that made of austenitic stainless steel up \nto about 2 % greater than the values given. Mass of ferritic/austenitic \n(duplex) stainless steel will be intermediate to the mass of fully austenitic \nand fully ferritic stainless steel tubing. \n8.2 The permitted variations from the calculated mass per \nfoot [kilogran1 per metre] shall be as prescribed in Table L \n9. Permitted Variations in Wall Thickness \n9.1 Variations from the specified minimum wall thickness \nshall not exceed the amounts prescribed in Table 2. \n9.2 For tubes 2 in. [50 mm] and over in outside diameter and \n0.220 in. [5.6 mm] and over in thickness, the variation in wall \nthickness in any one cross section of any one tube shall not \nexceed the following percentage of the actual mean wall at the \nsection. The actual mean wall is defined as the average of the \nthickest and thinnest wall in that section. \nSeamless tubes \u00b110 % \nWelded tubes \u00b15 % \n9.3 When cold-finished tubes as ordered require wall thick\u00ad\nnesses\u00be in. [19.1 mm] or over, or an inside diameter 60 % or \nless of the outside diameter, the permitted variations in wall \nthickness for hot-finished tubes shall apply. \n10. Permitted Variations in Outside Diameter \n10.1 Except as provided in 10.2.l, 10.3, and 25.10.4, \nvariations from the specified outside diameter shall not exceed \nthe amounts prescribed in Table 3. \n10.2 Thin-wall tubes usually develop significant ovality \n(out-of-roundness) during final annealing, or straightening, or \nboth. Thin-wall tubes are defined as those with a specified wall \n3 % or less than the specified OD, or with a wall specified as \n0.020 in. [0.5 mm] or less. \n10.2.1 1 The diameter tolerances of Table 3 are not suffi\u00ad\ncient to provide for additional ovality expected in thin-wall \n.tubes, and, for such tubes, are applicable only to the mean of \nthe extreme (maximum and minimum) outside diameter read\u00ad\nings in any one cross section. However, for thin wall tubes the \ndifference in extreme outside diameter readings (ovality) in any \none cross section shall not exceed the following ovality \nallowances: \nOutside Diameter, in. [mm] \n1 [25.4] and under \nOver 1 [25.4] \nOvality Allowance \n0.020 (0.5] \n2.0 % of specified outside \ndiameter \nTABLE 1 Permitted Variations in Mass Per FootA \nMethod of \nManufacture \nSeamless, hot-finished \nSeamless, cold-finished \n1 \u00bd in.
