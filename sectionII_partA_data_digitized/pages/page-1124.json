Scope \n1.1 This specification covers high-strength quenched \nand tempered low-alloy steel forged fittings and parts for \npressure vessels. The maximum thickness of forgings under \nthis specification shall be 1\u00bd in. [38 mm] for Grade A, \nand 4 in. [100 mm] for Grades E and F. \nNOTE 1- These grades are similar to corresponding grades in Specifica\u00ad\ntion A 517 /A 517M. \n1.2 Although no provision is made for supplementary \nrequirements in this standard, the supplementary require\u00ad\nments in Specification A 788 may be considered by the \npurchaser. \n1.3 Welding technique is of fundamental importance \nand it is presupposed that welding procedures will be in \naccordance with approved methods for the class of mate\u00ad\nrial used. \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \n(metric) units are to be regarded separately as the standard; \nwithin the text and tables, the SI units are shown in [brack\u00ad\nets]. The values stated in each system are not exact equiva\u00ad\nlents; therefore, each system must be used independently \nof the other. Combining values from the two systems may \nresult in nonconformance with the specification. \n1.5 Unless the order specifies the applicable \"M\" speci\u00ad\nfication designation, the material shall be furnished to the \ninch-pound units. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA 370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Test\u00ad\ning of Steel Products \nA 517 / A 517M Specification for Pressure Vessel Plates, \nAlloy Steel, High-Strength, Quenched and Tempered \nA 788 Specification for Steel Forgings, General Require\u00ad\nments \nE 112 Test Methods for Determining the Average Grain \nSize \n3. Ordering Information and General \nRequirements \n3.1 In addition to the ordering information required by \nSpecification A 788, the purchaser shall include with the \ninquiry and order the following information: \n3.1.1 A detailed drawing, a sketch, or written descrip\u00ad\ntion of the forging. \n3.1.2 The charpy impact test temperature if a test \ntemperature lower than 32\u00b0F [0\u00b0C) is required. \n3.1.3 Additional heat treatment cycles to be applied \nto the mechanical test specimens following removal from \nthe heat-treated forging or special forged test block. \n3.1.4 Required supplementary requirement(s) from \nspecification A 788. \n3.2 Material supplied to this specification shall conform \nto the requirements of Specification A 788, which outlines \nadditional ordering information, manufacturing require\u00ad\nments, testing and retesting methods and procedures, mark\u00ad\ning, certification, product analysis variations, and \nadditional supplementary requirements. Failure to comply \nwith the requirements of Specification A 788 constitutes \nnon-conformance with this specification. \n3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in con\u00ad\nflict with the requirements of Specification A 788, the \nrequirements of this specification shall prevail. \n1030 ",
