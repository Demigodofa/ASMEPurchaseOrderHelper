ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-1011/SA-1011M (ASTM A1011/A1011M) 
3.2.3 stabilization, n-addition of one or more nitride or 
carbide forming elements, or both, such as titanium and 
columbium, to control the level of the interstitial elements 
carbon and nitrogen in the steel. 
3.2.3.1 Discussion-Stabilization improves formability and 
increases resistance to aging. 
3.2.4 vacuum degassing, n-process of refining liquid steel 
in which the liquid is exposed to a vacuum as part of a special 
technique for removing impurities or for decarburizing the 
steel. 
3.2.5 Special Forming Steel (SFS), n-Steel ordered to 1010 
chemistry or greater levels of carbon, manganese or both, 
which exhibits enhanced formability or mechanical properties. 
3.2.5.1 Discussion-Steel grades such as CS - 1010 or CS -
1020 for example, adheres to chemistry requirements only, 
whereas SFS - 1010 or SFS - 1020, also provide enhanced 
formability. Due to greater carbon content, SFS - 1020 is not 
as formable as SFS - 1010. 
4. Classification

4.1.5 Commercial Steel Chemistry grade in accordance with 
Specification A568/ A568M Table X2.1, with no type specified 
(CS - 1005, CS - 1008, CS - 1020, and so forth), 
4.1.6 Special Forming Steel (SFS), chemistry as specified in 
Table 1 with carbon & manganese limits in accordance with 
Specification A568/A568M Tables X2 . l or X2.2 (examples: 
SFS - 1010, SFS - 1020, SFS - C 0.12-0.18 % & Mn 
0.50-0 .80 %). 
4.1.7 Structural Steel (SS grades 30[205], 33[230], 36[250] 
Types 1 and 2, 40[275], 45[310] Types 1 and 2, 50[340], 
55[380], 60[410], and 70[480]. 
4.1.8 High-Strength Low-Alloy Steel (HSLAS, classes 1 
and 2, in grades 45[310], 50[340], 55[380], 60[410], 65[450], 
and 70[480]. 
4.1.9 High-Strength Low-Alloy Steel with Improved Form­
ability (HSLAS-F grades 50[340], 60[410], 70[480], and 
80[550]). 
4.1.9.1 HSLAS-F steel has improved formability when 
compared to HSLAS. The steel is fully deoxidized, made to a 
fine grain practice, and includes microalloying elements such 
as columbium, vanadium, and zirconium. The steel shall be 
treated to achieve inclusion control. 
4.1.10 Ultra-High Strength (UHSS Types 1 and 2, in Grades 
90 [620] and 100 [690]). 
4.1.10.1 UHSS steel has increased strength compared with 
HSLAS-F. The steel is killed and made to a fine ferritic grain 
practice, and includes microalloying elements such as colum­
bium (niobium), titanium, vanadium, molybdenum, and so 
forth. The steel shall be treated to achieve inclusion control. 
The material is intended for miscellaneous applications where 
higher strength, savings in weight, and weldability are impor­
tant. Atmospheric corrosion resistance of these steels is equiva­
lent to plain carbon steels. With copper specified, the atmo­
spheric corrosion resistance is somewhat enhanced. 
4.1.11 When required for HSLAS, HSLAS-F, and UHSS 
steels, limitations on the use of one or more of the microalloy 
elements shall be specified on the order. 
5. Ordering Information 
5.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order all ordering information necessary to describe 
the required material. Examples of such information include, 
but are not limited to, the following:
