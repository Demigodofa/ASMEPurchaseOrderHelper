[40-mm] wide test specimens, full \nthickness of the plate and conforming to the requirements \nshown in Fig. 3 of Test Methods and Definitions A370, shall be \nsubject to the limitation that adequate testing machine capacity \nis available. \n11.5.1.3 For plates over\u00be in. [20 mm] in thickness, except \nas permitted in 11.5.1.2, tension test specimens shall conform \nto the requirements shown in Fig. 4 of Test Methods and \nDefinitions A370 for the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] diameter test \nspecimen. The axis of such test specimens shall be located \nmidway between the center of thickness and the top or bottom \nsurface of the plate. \n11.5.2 Shapes: \n11.5.2.1 Except where angles are tested in full section, \ntension test specimens for shapes\u00be in. [20 mm] and under in \nthickness shall be the full thickness of the shape. Such test \nspecimen shall conform to the requirements shown in Fig. 3 of \n13 \nTest Methods and Definitions A370 for either the 1 \u00bd-in. \n[40-mm] wide test specimen or the \u00bd-in.
