ASME BPVC.II.A-Z0Z5 SA-691/SA-691M 
8.1.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation-The test 
specimen shall be made transverse to the weld at the end of the 
finished pipe and may be flattened cold before final machining 
to size. 
8.1.4 Test Method-The test specimen shall be made in 
accordance with QW-150 in Section IX of the ASME Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel Code. The test specimen shall be tested at 
room temperature in accordance with Test Methods and Defi­
nitions A370. 
8.2 Transverse-Guided-Weld-Bend Tests: 
8.2.1 Requirements-The bend test shall be acceptable if no 
cracks or other defects exceeding Vs in. [3 mm] in any direction 
be present in the weld metal or between the weld and the pipe 
metal after bending. Cracks that originate along the edges of 
the specimens during testing, and that are less than ¼ in. [6 
mm] in any direction shall not be considered. 
8.2.2 Number of Tests-One test (two specimens) shall be 
made to represent each lot of finished pipe. 
8.2.3 Test Specimen Location and Orientation-Two bend 
test specimens shall be taken transverse to the weld at the end 
of the finished pipe. As an alternative, by agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer, the test specimens may be 
taken from a test plate of the same material as the pipe, the test 
plate being attached to the end of the cylinder and welded as a 
prolongation of the pipe longitudinal weld seam. 
8.2.4 Test Method-Bend tests shall be made in accordance 
with Test Methods and Definitions A370, A 2.5.1.7. For wall 
thicknesses over 3/s in. [10 mm] but less than¾ in. [19 mm] 
side-bend tests may be made instead of the face and root-bend 
tests. For wall thicknesses ¾ in. [19 mm] and over both 
specimens shall be subjected to the side-bend test. 
8.3 Pressure Test-Classes X2 and X3, pipe shall be tested 
in accordance with Specification A530/A530M, Hydrostatic 
Test Requirements. 
9. Radiographic Examination 
9.1 The full length of each weld of classes Xl and X2 shall 
be radiographically examined in accordance with requirements 
of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, 
Paragraph UW-51. 
9.2 Radiographic examination may be pe1formed prior to 
heat treatment. 
10. Rework 
10.1 Elimination of Surface Imperfections-Unacceptable 
surface imperfections shall be removed by grinding or machin­
ing. The remaining thickness of the section shall be no less than 
the minimum specified in Section 11. The depression after 
grinding or machining shall be blended uniformly into the 
surrounding surface. 
10.2 Repair of Base Metal Defects by Welding: 
10.2.1 The manufacturer may repair, by welding, base metal 
where defects have been removed, provided the depth of the 
repair cavity as prepared for welding does not exceed 1/3 of the 
nominal thickness, and the requirements of 10.2.2, 10.2.3, 
10.2.4, 10.2.5, and 10.2.6 are met. Base metal defects in excess 
of these may be repaired with prior approval of the customer. 
10.2.2 The defect shall be removed by suitable mechanical 
or thermal cutting or gouging methods and the cavity prepared 
for repair welding. 
10.2.3 The welding procedure and welders or welding 
operators are to be qualified in accordance with Section IX of 
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
10.2.4 The full length of the repaired pipe shall be heat 
treated after repair in accordance with the requirements of the 
pipe class specified. 
10.2.5 Each repair weld of a defect where the cavity, 
prepared for welding, has a depth exceeding the lesser of 3/s in. 
[10 mm] or 10 % of the nominal thickness shall be examined 
by radiography in accordance with the methods and the 
acceptance standards of Section 9. 
10.2.6 The repair surface shall be blended uniformly into 
the surrounding base metal surface and examined and accepted 
in accordance with Supplementary Requirements S6 or S8. 
10.3 Repair of Weld Metal Defects by Welding: 
10.3.1 The manufacturer may repair weld metal defects if he 
meets the requirements of 10.2.3, 10.2.4, 10.3.2, 10.3.3, and 
10.4. 
10.3.2 The defect shall be removed by suitable mechanical 
or thermal cutting or gouging methods and the repair cavity 
examined and accepted in accordance with Supplementary 
Requirements S7 or S9. 
10.3.3 The weld repair shall be blended uniformly into the 
surrounding metal smfaces and examined and accepted in 
accordance with 9.1 and with Supplementary Requirements S7 
or S9. 
10.4 Retest-Each length of repaired pipe of a class requir­
ing a pressure test shall be hydrostatically tested following 
repair. 
11. Dimensions, Mass, and Permissible Variations 
11.1 The wall thickness and weight for welded pipe fur­
nished to this specification shall be governed by the require­
ments of the specification to which the manufacturer ordered 
the plate. 
11.2 Permissible variations in dimensions at any point in a 
length of pipe shall not exceed the following: 
11.2.1 Outside Diameter-Based on circumferential 
measurement, ± 0.5 % of the specified outside diameter. 
11.2.2 Out-of-Roundness-The difference between major 
and minor outside diameters, 1 %. 
11.2.3 Alignment-Using a 10-ft [3-m] straightedge placed 
so that both ends are in contact with the pipe, 1/s in. [3 mm]. 
11.2.4 Thickness-The minimum wall thickness at any point 
in the pipe shall not be more than 0.01 in. [0.3 mm] under the 
specified nominal thickness. 
11.3 Circumferential welded joints of the same quality as 
the longitudinal joints shall be permitted by agreement between 
the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
11.4 Lengths with unmachined ends shall be within -0, 
+½ in. [-0, + 13 mm] of that specified. Lengths with machined 
ends shall be as agreed between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser.
