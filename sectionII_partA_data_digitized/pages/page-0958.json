If the \norder specifies no oil, the purchaser assumes responsibility for \nrust in transit. \n14.2 Special surface preparations as may be required for \nspecific applications are not within the scope of this section. \nSuch requirements shall be considered under the supplemen\u00ad\n----:ary7'r~~~rovisi~of,his-speeifieati-011~nd \ndetails shall be provided in the purchase order. \n15. Rejection \n15.1 Tubes that fail to meet the requirements of this \nspecification shall be set aside and the producer shall be \nnotified. \n16. Product and Package Marking \n16.1 Civilian Procurement-Each box, bundle, lift, or piece \nshall be identified by a tag or stencil with manufacturers name \nor brand, specified size, type, purchaser's order number, and \nthis specification number. Bar coding is acceptable as a \nsupplementary identification method. Bar coding should be \nconsistent with the Automotive Industry Action Group [AIAG] \n858 \nstandard prepared by the Primary Metals Subcommittee of the \nAIAG Bar Code Project Team. \n16.2 Government Procurement-When specified in the con\u00ad\ntract or order, and for direct procurement by or direct shipment \nto the Government, marking for shipment, in addition to \nrequirements specified in the contract or order, shall be in \naccordance withr.IlL=STD-129 for Military agencies and m \naccordance with Fed. Std. No. 123 for civil agencies. \n16.3 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 16.1 \nand 16.2, bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identifi\u00ad\ncation method. The purchaser may specify in the order a \nspecific bar coding system to be used. \n17. Packaging \n17.1 Civilian Procurement-On tubing 16 gauge, 0.065 in. \n[1.7 mm] and lighter, the producer will determine whether or \nnot the tubing will be boxed, crated, cartoned, packaged in \nsecured lifts, or bundled to ensure safe delivery unless other\u00ad\nwise instructed. Tubing heavier than 16 gauge will normally be \nshipped loose, bundled, or in secured lifts. Special packaging ",
