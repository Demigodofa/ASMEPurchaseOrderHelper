A formula for calculating camber is as follows: \nL 2 X C 1 \n64 = C 2 in L \nwhere: \nC 1 = Camber in 8 ft and \nC 2 = Camber in any given length L \nOver 10 Over 20 Over 30 \nto to to \n20 ft, 30 ft, 40 ft, Over 40 ft, \nincl incl incl incl \n\u00bd [nlJP 1 1\u00bd \n\u00be [nlJP 1 1\u00bd \nl 1\u00bc 1\u00bd l[nlJP \nTABLE 9 \nFLATNESS TOLERANCES OF HOT-ROLLED STRIP \n(CARBON AND HIGH-STRENGTH LOW-ALLOY) \nIt has not been practicable to formulate flatness tolerances \nfor hot-rolled carbon strip steel because of the wide range \nof widths and thicknesses, and variety of chemical \ncompositions, mechanical properties and types, produced in \ncoils and cut lengths. \n1228 ",
