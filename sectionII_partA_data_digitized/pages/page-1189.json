Terminology \n3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.1.1 lot-a lot shall consist of 200 ft [60 m] or fraction \nthereof of pipe from the same heat of steel. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 The inquiry and order for material under this specifica-\ntion should include the following information: \n4.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), \n4.1.2 Name of material (steel pipe, electric-fusionwelded), \n4.1.3 Specification number, \n4.1.4 Grade and class designations (see 1.3), \n4 Available from American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), ASME \nInternational Headquarters, Two Park Ave., New York, NY 10016-5990, http:// \nwww.asme.org. \n4.1.5 Size (inside or outside diameter, nominal or minimum \nwall thickness), \n4.1.6 Length (specific or random), \n4.1.7 End finish (11.4), \n4.1.8 Purchase options, if any (see 5.2.3 and 11.3 of this \nspecification. See also Specification A530/A530M), \n4.1.9 Supplementary requirements, if any. \n5. Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 Materials-The steel plate material shall conform to the \nrequirement of the applicable plate specification for the pipe \ngrade ordered as listed in Table 1. \n5.2 Welding: \n5.2.1 The joints shall be double-welded, full-penetration \nwelds made in accordance with procedures and by welders or \nwelding operators qualified in accordance with the ASME \nBoiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX. \n5.2.2 The welds shall be made either manually or automati\u00ad\ncally by an electric process involving the deposition of filler \nmetal. \n5.2.3 As welded, the welded joint shall have positive \nreinforcement at the center of each side of the weld, but no \nmore than 1/s in. [3 mm]. This reinforcement may be removed \nat the manufacturer's option or by agreement between the \nmanufacturer and purchaser. The contour of the reinforcement \nshall be smooth and the deposited metal shall be fused \nsmoothly and uniformly into the plate surface. \n5.3 Heat Treatment-All classes other than 10, 11, 12, and \n13 shall be heat u:eated in furnace controlled to\u00b1 25 \u00b0F [\u00b1 15 \n0 C] and equipped with a recording pyrometer so that heating \nrecords are available. Heat treating after forming and welding \nshall be to one of the following: \nTABLE 1 Plate Specifications \nPipe Grade Type of Steel ASTM Specification \nNo. Grade/ \nClass I \nType \nCA55 plain carbon A285/A285M GrC \nCB 60 plain carbon, killed A515/A515M Gr60 \nCB 65 plain carbon, killed A515/A515M Gr65 \nCB 70 plain carbon, killed A515/A515M Gr70 \ncc 60 plain carbon, killed, fine grain A516/A516M Gr60 \ncc 65 plain carbon, killed, fine grain A516/A516M Gr65 \nCC70 plain carbon, killed, fine grain A516/A516M Gr70 \nCD 70 manganese-silicon, normalized A537/A537M Cl 1 \nCD BO manganese-silicon, quenched and A537/A537M Cl 2 \ntempered \nCFA65 nickel steel A203/A203M GrA \nCFB70 nickel steel A203/A203M GrB \nCFD65 nickel steel A203/A203M GrD \nCFE70 nickel steel A203/A203M GrE \nCG 100 9 % nickel A353/A353M \nCH 115 9 % nickel A553/A553M Type 1 \nCJA 115 alloy steel, quenched and tempered A517/A517M GrA \nCJB 115 alloy steel, quenched and tempered A517/A517M GrB \nCJE 115 alloy steel, quenched and tempered A517/A517M GrE \nCJF 115 alloy steel, quenched and tempered A517/A517M GrF \nCJH 115 alloy steel, quenched and tempered A517/A517M GrH \nCJP 115 alloy steel, quenched and tempered A517/A517M GrP \nCK75 carbon-manganese-silicon A299/A299M GrA \nCP85 alloy steel, age hardening, quenched A736/A736M Gr A, \nand precipitation heat treated Class 3 \n1099 ",
