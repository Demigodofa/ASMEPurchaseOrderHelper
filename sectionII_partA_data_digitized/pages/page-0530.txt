6.3.1 Definition-The rotational capacity test is intended to 
evaluate the presence of a lubricant, the efficiency of the 
lubricant, and the compatibility of assemblies as represented by 
the components selected for testing. 
6.3.2 Requirement-Zinc-coated bolts, zinc-coated washers, 
and zinc-coated and lubricated nuts tested full size in an 
assembled joint or tension measuring device, in accordance 
with 10.2, shall not show signs of failure when subjected to the 
nut rotation in Table 6. The test shall be performed by the 
responsible patty (see Section 14) prior to shipment after zinc 
coating and lubrication of nuts (see 10.2 and Note 4). 
6.3.3 Acceptance Criterion-The bolt and nut assembly 
shall be considered as non-conforming if the assembly fails to 
pass any one of the following specified requirements: 
6.3.3.1 Inability to install the assembly to the nut rotation in 
Table 6. 
6.3.3.2 Inability to remove the nut after installing to the 
rotation specified in Table 6. 
6.3.3.3 Shear failure of the threads as determined by visual 
examination of bolt and nut threads following removal. 
6.3.3.4 Torsional or torsional/tension failure of the bolt. 
Elongation of the bolt, in the threads between the nut and bolt 
head, is to be expected at the required rotation and is not to be 
classified as a failure. 
7. Dimensions 
7.1 Head and Body: 
7.1.1 The bolts shall conform to the dimensions for heavy 
hex structural bolts specified in ASME B18.2.6. 
7 .1.2 The thread length shall not be changed except as 
provided in Supplementary Requirement S 1. Bolts with thread 
lengths other than those required by this specification shall be 
ordered under Specification A449. 
7.2 Threads: 
7.2.1 Uncoated-Threads shall be the Unified Coarse 
Thread Series as specified inASME Bl.I, and shall have Class 
2A tolerances. 
7 .2.2 Coated-Unless otherwise specified, zinc-coated bolts 
to be used with zinc-coated nuts or tapped holes that are tapped 
oversize, in accordance with Specification A563, shall have 
Class 2A threads before hot-dip or mechanically deposited zinc 
coating. After zinc coating, the maximum limits of pitch and 
major diameter shall not exceed the Class 2A limit by more 
than the following amounts:

A Hot-dip zinc nuts are tapped oversize after coating, and mechanical zinc­
coated nuts are tapped oversize before coating. 
7 .2.3 The gaging limit for bolts shall be verified during 
manufacture. In case of dispute, a calibrated thread ring gage of 
the same size as the oversize limit in 7 .2.2 (Class X tolerance, 
gage tolerance plus) shall be used to verify compliance. The 
gage shall assemble with hand effort following application of 
light machine oil to prevent galling and damage to the gage. 
These inspections, when performed to resolve controversy, 
shall be conducted at the frequency specified in the quality 
assurance provisions of ASME B18.2.6. 
8. Workmanship 
8.1 The allowable limits, inspection, and evaluation of the 
surface discontinuities, quench cracks, forging cracks, head 
bursts, shear bursts, seams, folds, thread laps, voids, tool 
marks, nicks, and gouges shall be in accordance with Specifi­
cation F788/F788M. 
9. Number of Tests and Retests 
9 .1 Testing Responsibility: 
478 
9 .1.1 Each lot shall be tested by the manufacturer prior to 
shipment in accordance with the lot identification control 
quality assurance plan in 9.2 through 9.5. 
9.1.2 When bolts are furnished by a source other than the 
manufacturer, the Responsible Patty as defined in 14 shall be 
responsible for assuring all tests have been perfom1ed and the 
bolts comply with the requirements of this specification (see 
4.5). 
9.2 Purpose of Lot Inspection-The purpose of a lot inspec­
tion program is to ensure that each lot confonns to the 
requirements of this specification. For such a plan to be fully 
effective it is essential that secondary processors, distributors,
