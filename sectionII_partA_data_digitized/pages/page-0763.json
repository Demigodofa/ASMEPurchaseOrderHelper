General Requirements for Delivery \n4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con\u00ad\nform to the applicable requirements of the current edition of \nSpecification A999/ A999M unless otherwise provided herein. \n5. Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 Heat-Treatment-The pipe shall be furnished in the \naustenitized and tempered condition (Note 1) according to the \nrequirements of Table 2. \n5.1.1 Heat treatment shall be performed after the pipe has \nbeen allowed to cool below the transformation range. Defini\u00ad\ntion of heat-treatment terms shall be as given in Terminology \nA941. \nNOTE 1-lt is recommended that the temperature for tempedng should \nbe at least 100\u00b0F [55\u00b0C] above the intended service temperature. The \npurchaser shall advise the manufacturer of the service temperature when \nit is over 1000\u00b0F [540\u00b0C]. (See 3.1.10.) \n5.2 Machining-The pipe shall be machined on the inner \nand outer surfaces to a roughness value no greater than 250 \u00b5 \nin. [6.35 \u00b5m] arithmetical average deviation (AA) from the \nmean line unless otherwise specified as in ANSI B46.1. \n6. Chemical Analysis \n6.1 Heat Analysis-An analysis of each heat shall be made \nby the manufacturer to determine the percentages of elements \nspecified in Table 1. The analysis shall be made on a test \nSulfur, Silicon Chromium Molybdenum max \n0.025 0.10-0.50 0.44-0.65 \n0.025 0.10-0.50 0.50-0.81 0.44-0.65 \n0.025 0.75 4.00-6.50 0.45-0.65 \nmax \n0.025 1.00-2.00 4.00-6.00 0.45-0.65 \n0.025 0.25-1.00 8.00-10.00 0.90-1.20 \n0.025 0.60 1.00-1.50 0.44-0.65 \nmax \n0.025 0.50 0.80-1.25 0.44-0.65 \nmax \n0.025 1.15-1.65 0.44-0.65 \n0.025 0.50 2.65-3.35 0.80-1.06 \nmax \n0.025 0.60 2.00-2.75 0.90-1.20 \nmax \n0.025 1.50 11.5-14.0 0.50 \nmax max \nsample taken preferable during the pouring of the heat. The \nchemical composition thus determined shall conform to the \nrequirements specified in Table 1. \n6.2 Product Analysis-A product analysis may be made by \nthe purchaser. The sample for analysis shall be selected so as to \nbe representative of the pipe being analyzed. The chemical \ncomposition thus determined shall conform to the requirements \nof Table 1. \n7. Tensile and Hardness Requirements \n7 .1 Steel used for the castings shall conform to the tensile \nand hardness requirements specified in Table 3. \n8. Permissible Variations in Dimensions \n8.1 Thickness-The wall thickness shall not vary over that \nspecified by more than Vs in. [3 mm]. There shall be no \nvariation under the specified wall thickness. \n9. Number of Tests \n9 .1 One tension and one hardness test shall be made from \neach heat. \n9.2 If a specimen is machined improperly or if flaws are \nrevealed by machining or during testing, the specimen may be \ndiscarded and another substituted from the same heat. \n10. Retests \n10.1 If the results of the mechanical tests for any heat do not \nconform . to the requirements specified, the castings may be \nreheat-treated and retested, but may not be re-austenitized \nmore than twice. \n11. Test Specimens \n11.1 Test coupons from which tension test specimens are \nprepared shall be removed from heat-treated casting prolonga\u00ad\ntions. \n713 ",
