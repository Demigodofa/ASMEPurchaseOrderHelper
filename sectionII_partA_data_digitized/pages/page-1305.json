Terminology \n3.l Definitions: \n3 .1.1 For definitions of terms used in these test methods and \npractices, see Terminology A941. \n3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.2.1 product, check, or verification analysis, n-a chemical \nanalysis of the semifinished or finished product, usually for the \npurpose of determining conformance to the specification re\u00ad\nquirements. \n3.2.1.1 Discussion-The range of the specified composition \napplicable to product analysis is normally greater than that \napplicable to heat analysis in order to take into account \ndeviations associated with analytical reproducibility (Note 1) \nand the heterogeneity of the steel. \nNoTE 1-All of the chemical analysis procedures referenced in these \ntest methods include precision statements with reproducibility data, with \nthe exception of Test Methods E50. \n3.2.2 product analysis tolerances, n-a permissible varia\u00ad\ntion over the maximum limit or under the minimum limit of a \nspecified element and applicable only to product analyses, not \ncast or heat analyses (Note 2). \nNoTE 2-The term \"analysis tolerance\" is often misunderstood. It does \nnot apply to cast or heat analyses determined to show conformance to \nspecified chemical limits. It applies only to product analysis and becomes \nmeaningful only when the heat analysis of an element falls close to one of \nthe specified limits. For example, stainless steel UNS 30400 limits for \nchromium are 18.00 to 20.00 %. A heat that the producer reported as \n18.01 % chromium may be found to show 17.80 % chromium by a user \nperforming a product analysis. If the product analysis tolerance for such a \nchromium level is 0.20 %, the product analysis of 17.80 % chromium \nwould be acceptable. A product analysis of 17.79 % would not be \nacceptable. \n3.2.3 proprietary analytical method, n-a non-standard ana\u00ad\nlytical method, not published by ASTM, utilizing reference \nstandards traceable to the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST), when available, or other sources refer\u00ad\nenced in Section 10. \n3.2.4 referee analysis, n-performed using ASTM test \nmethods listed in 9.1.1, NIST reference standards or methods, \nand reference standards agreed upon between parties. \n3.2.4.1 Discussion-The selection of a laboratory to per\u00ad\nform the referee analysis shall be a matter of agreement \nbetween the supplier and the purchaser. \n3.2.5 certified reference material, n-a specimen of material \nspecially prepared, analyzed, and certified for chemical content \nunder the jurisdiction of a recognized standardizing agency or \ngroup, such as the NIST, for use by analytical laboratories as an \naccurate basis for comparison. \n3.2.5.1 Discussion-Reference samples should bear suffi\u00ad\ncient resemblance to the material to be analyzed so that no \nsignificant differences are required in procedures or corrections \n(for example, for interferences or inter-element effects). \n3.2.6 working reference materials, n-reference materials \nused for routine analytical control and traceable to NIST \nstandards and other recognized standards when appropriate \nstandards are available. \n1235 ",
