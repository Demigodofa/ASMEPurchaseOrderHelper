Apparatus \n22.1 Testing Machines: \n22.1.1 A Charpy impact machine is one in which a notched \nspecimen is broken by a single blow of a freely swinging \npendulum. The pendulum is released from a fixed height. Since \nthe height to which the pendulum is raised prior to its swing, \nand the mass of the pendulum are known, the energy of the \nblow is predetermined. A means is provided to indicate the \nenergy absorbed in breaking the specimen. \n22.1.2 The other principal feature of the machine is a fixture \n(see Fig. 10) designed to support a test specimen as a simple \nbeam at a precise location. The fixture is arranged so that the \nnotched face of the specimen is vertical. The pendulum strikes \nthe other vertical face directly opposite the notch. The dimen\u00ad\nsions of the specimen supports and striking edge shall conform \nto Fig. 10. \n22.1.3 Charpy machines used for testing steel generally \nhave capacities in the 220 to 300 ft-lbf (300 to 400 J) energy \nrange. Sometimes machines of lesser capacity are used; \nhowever, the capacity of the machine should be substantially in \nexcess of the absorbed energy of the specimens (see Test \nMethods E23). The linear velocity at the point of impact should \nbe in the range of 16 to 19 ft/s (4.9 to 5.8 m/s). \nNorn 15-An investigation of striker radius effect is available. \n22.2 Temperature Media: \n22.2.1 For testing at other than room temperature, it is \nnecessary to condition the Charpy specimens in media at \ncontrolled temperatures. \n22.2.2 Low temperature media usually are chilled fluids \n(such as water, ice plus water, dry ice plus organic solvents, or \nliquid nitrogen) or chilled gases. \n22.2.3 Elevated temperat11re media are usually heated liq\u00ad\nuids such as mineral or silicone oils. Circulating air ovens may \nbe used. \n22.3 Handling Equipment-Tongs, especially adapted to fit \nthe notch in the impact specimen, normally are used for \nremoving the specimens from the medium and placing them on \nthe anvil (refer to Test Methods E23). In cases where the \nmachine fixture does not provide for automatic centering of the \ntest specimen, the tongs may be precision machined to provide \ncentering. \n23. Sampling and Number of Specimens \n23.1 Sampling: \n23.1.1 Test location and orientation should be addressed by \nthe specifications. If not, for wrought products, the test location \nshall be the same as that for the tensile specimen and the \norientation shall be longitudinal with the notch perpendicular \nto the major surface of the product being tested. \n23.l.2 Number of Specimens. \n23.1.2.1 All specimens used for a Charpy impact test shall \nbe taken from a single test coupon or test location. \n23.1.2.2 When the specification calls for a minimum aver\u00ad\nage test result, three specimens shall be tested. \n-1--'!r---Centllf or \nSttike (W /2) \nS1>ecimeo \nSupport \nAll dimensional tolerances shall be \u00b10.05 mm (0.002 in.) unless otherwise \nspecified. \nNorn 1-A shall be parallel to B within 2:1000 and coplanar with B \nwithin 0.05 mm (0.002 in.). \nNorn 2-C shall be parallel to D within 20:1000 and coplanar with D \nwithin 0.125 mm (0.005 in.). \nNorn 3-Finish on unmarked parts shall be 4 \u00b5m (125 ~tin.). \nNorn 4-To!erance for the striker corner radius shall be -0.05 mm \n(0.002 in.)/+0.50 mm (0.020 in.) \nFIG. 1 O Charpy (Simple-beam) Impact Test \n23.1.2.3 When the specification requires determination of a \ntransition temperature, eight to twelve specimens are usually \nneeded. \n23.2 Type and Size: \n23.2.1 Use a standard full size Charpy V-notch specimen as \nshown in Fig. 11, except as allowed in 23.2.2. \n603 \n23.2.2 Subsized Specimens. \n23.2.2.1 For flat material less than 7/i6 in. (11 mm) thick, or \nwhen the absorbed energy is expected to exceed 80 % of full \nscale, use standard subsize test specimens. \n23.2.2.2 For tubular materials tested in the transverse \ndirection, where the relationship between diameter and wall \nthickness does not permit a standard full size specimen, use \nstandard subsize test specimens or standard size specimens \ncontaining outer diameter (OD) curvature as follows: \n( 1) Standard size specimens and subsize specimens may \ncontain the original OD surface of the tubular product as shown \nin Fig. 12. All other dimensions shall comply with the \nrequirements of Fig. 11. \nNoTE 16-For materials with toughness levels in excess of about \n50 ft-lbs, specimens containing the otiginal OD surface may yield values \nin excess of those resulting from the use of conventional Charpy \nspecimens. \n23.2.2.3 If a standard full-size specimen cannot be prepared, \nthe largest feasible standard subsize specimen shall be pre\u00ad\npared. The specimens shall be machined so that the specimen \ndoes not include material nearer to the surface than 0.020 in. \n(0.5 mm). ",
