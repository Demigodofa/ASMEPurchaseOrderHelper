A number in parentheses indicates the year of last \nreapproval. A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification covers creep-strength enhanced alloy \nsteel castings for valves, flanges, fittings, and other pressure\u00ad\ncontaining parts intended primarily for high-temperature ser\u00ad\nvice (see Note 1). However, they are not restricted to such \napplications and the castings may be used for other applica\u00ad\ntions for which the attributes of the material, as defined by this \nspecification, are suitable. \n1.2 Two grades of martensitic alloy steel, Grade C91 (UNS \nNo. 184090) and Grade C933 (UNS No. 184093), are covered. \nGrade C91 is provided in two classes, differentiated by the type \nof heat treatment after welding. Both grades, and similar steels, \nare characterized by a predominantly tempered martensitic or \ntempered bainitic microstructure that is stabilized by the \nprecipitation of temper-resistant particles at various precipitate \nnucleation sites in the microstructure. Such steels are designed \nto have creep-rupture strengths significantly superior to those \nof alloys of nominally similar compositions, but in which the \nprecipitates or nucleation sites are absent. Since this crucial \ndifference cannot be revealed by room temperature mechanical \nproperty tests, these alloys require tighter controls on manu\u00ad\nfacturing and processing. \nNorn 1-The grades covered by this specification represent materials \nthat are generally suitable for assembly with other castings or wrought \nsteel parts by fusion welding. It is not intended to imply that these grades \npossess equal degrees of weldability; therefore, it is the responsibility of \nthe purchaser to establish a suitable welding technique. Since these grades \npossess varying degrees of suitability for high-temperature service, it is \nalso the responsibility of the purchaser to determine which grade shall be \nfurnished, due consideration being given to the requirements of the \napplicable construction codes. \n1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee A0l on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.18 on Castings. \nCurrent edition approved July l, 2024.
