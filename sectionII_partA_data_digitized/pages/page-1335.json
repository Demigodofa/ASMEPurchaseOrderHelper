The \nacceptance of any such additional requirements shall be \ndependent on negotiations with the supplier and must be \nincluded in the order. \n1.4 If, by agreement, forgings are to be supplied in a \npartially completed condition, that is, all of the provisions of \nthe product specification have not been filled, then the material \nmarking (see Section 17) and certification (see Section 16) \nshall reflect the extent to which the product specification \nrequirements have been met. \n1.5 As noted in the Certification Section (16), the number \nand year date of this specification, as well as that of the product \nspecification, are required to be included in the product \ncertification. \n1.6 When the SI version of a product specification is \nrequired by the purchase order, Specification A788/A788M \nshall be used in conjunction with Test Methods A1058 instead \nof Test Methods and Definitions A370. \n1. 7 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n1.8 This standard does not purport to address all of the \nsafety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the \nresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro\u00ad\npriate safety and health practices and determine the applica\u00ad\nbility of regulatory limitations prior to use. \n2.
