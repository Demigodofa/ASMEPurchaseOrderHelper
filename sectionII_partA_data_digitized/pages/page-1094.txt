TABLE A1.7 Camber TolerancesA for Hot-Rolled (Including 
Pickled) and Cold-Rolled Sheet (All Designations) 
(Cut Lengths) 
Norn I-Camber is the greatest deviation of a side edge from a straight 
line, the measurement being taken on the concave side with a straightedge.

TABLE A1.8 Out-of-Square Tolerances of Hot-Rolled Cut-Edge 
(Including Pickled) and Cold-Rolled Sheet (All Designations) 
(Cut Lengths) 
Out-of-square is the greatest deviation of an end edge from a straight line at 
right angle to a side and touching one corner. It is also obtained by measuring 
the difference between the diagonals of the cut length. The out-of-square 
deviation is one half of that difference. The tolerance for all thicknesses and all 
sizes is 1.0 mm/100 mm of width or fraction thereof. 
TABLE A1.9 Restricted Squareness Tolerances of Hot-Rolled 
(Including Pickled) and Cold-Rolled Sheet (All Designations) 
(Cut Lengths) 
When cut lengths are specified restricted squareness, the width and the length 
are not less than the dimensions specified. The individual tolerance for over­
width, over-length, camber, or out-of-square should not exceed 1.6 mm up to 
and Including 1200 mm in width and up to and including 3000 mm in length. 
For cut lengths wider or longer, the applicable tolerance is 3.2 mm.
