Forging Requirements \nS8.l Large drum forgings shall be made from solid cast \ningots, punched, bored, or trepanned, or from hollow ingots \ncast in metal molds. The walls of the hollowed or hollow ingots \nshall be reduced in thickness at least one-half by forging on \nmandrels. \nS8.2 Drum forgings with one solid closed end may be \nhollow forged in closed dies or on a draw bench provided the \nmetal is worked thoroughly. \nS8.3 Drum forgings, either with open ends or one solid \nclosed end, may also be produced by hot extrusion provided \nthe metal is worked thoroughly. \nS8.4 Small drum forgings may be made as solid forgings, \nsubsequently bored, provided the purchaser agrees to this \nmethod of forging. The cross-sectional area of the solid \nforgings shall have a reduction by forging from that of the \ningot in the ratio of not less than 3:1. \nS8.5 Small sections or component parts of pressure vessels, \nwhich are to be subsequently assembled to form drums, may be \nmade by expanding on a mandrel under a press or hammer, by \nhot extrusion or by ring rolling methods, provided the wall \nthickness is reduced at least one-half in the process. \nS8.6 Heads or covers shall be forged as disks, upset from \nblocks cut from ingots or billets. The length of block before \nupsetting shall be at least twice the thickness of the as-forged \nhead or cover. \nS9. Individual Forging \nS9.1 Forgings, whether identical or not identical, shall be \nproduced individually. They shall not be forged in multiple and \nseparated prior to or after heat treatment. \nS9.2 The shape and size of individual forgings shall be \nagreed between the manufacturer and the purchaser by means \nof a forging drawing or the purchase order. \nS10. Minimum Cooling Rate \nSlO.l For Grade P91 Type 2 material the heat treatment \nshall ensure that following austenitizing, the rate of cooling \nfrom 1650 \u00b0P to 900 \u00b0P [900 \u00b0C to 480 \u00b0C] is no slower than \n9 \u00b0P/2nin [5 \u00b0C/min]. \nSUMMARY OF CHANGES \nCommittee A0l has identified the location of selected changes to this standard since the last issue \n(A336/A336M- 21) that may impact the use of this standard.
