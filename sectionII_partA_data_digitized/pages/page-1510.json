Scope \n1.1 This specification covers hot isostatically-pressed, pow\u00ad\nder metallurgy, stainless steel piping components for use in \npressure systems. Included are flanges, fittings, valves, and \nsimilar parts made to specified dimensions or to dimensional \nstandards, such as in ASME specification B16.5. \n1.2 Several grades of martensitic, austenitic, age hardening, \nand austenitic-ferritic stainless steels are included in this \nspecification. \n1.3 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when \nadditional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply \nonly when specified individually by the purchaser in the order. \n1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units \nand in SI units. Unless the order specifies the applicable \"M\" \nspecification designation (SI units), however, the material shall \nbe furnished to inch-pound units. \n1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as the standard. Within the text, \nthe SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. \n1.6 The following safety hazards caveat pertains only to test \nmethods portions 8.1, 8.2, 9.5 - 9.7, and Section 10 of this \nspecification: This standard does not purport to address all of \nthe safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the \nresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro\u00ad\npriate safety and health practices and determine the applica\u00ad\nbility of regulatory limitations prior to use. \n1.7 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
