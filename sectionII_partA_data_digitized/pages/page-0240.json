Product Analysis \n7 .1 An analysis may be made by the purchaser on samples \nof pipe selected at random and shall conform to the require\u00ad\nments specified in Table 2. Methods and practices relating to \nchemical analysis shall be in accordance with Test Method, \nPractices, and Terminology A751. \n8. Mechanical Properties Requirements \n8.1 Tensile Properties: \n8.1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to \ntensile properties prescribed in Table 1. \n8.1.2 The yield strength shall be determined by the offset \nmethod utilizing 0.2 % of the gauge length or by the total \nextension under load method using 0.5 % of the gauge length. \n8.1.3 Longitudinal test specimens shall be full-size longitu\u00ad\ndinal test specimens (see Figure A2.1 of Test Methods and \nDefinitions A370) or longitudinal strip test specimens (see \nSpecimen No. 4 in Fig. A2.3 of Test Methods and Definitions \nA370). \n8.2 The test specimen taken across the weld shall show a \ntensile strength not less than the minimum tensile strength \nspecified for the grade of pipe ordered. This test will not be \nrequired for pipe under NPS 8 [DN 200]. \n9. Flattening Test \n9.1 A specimen at least 4 in. [100 mm] in length shall be \nflattened cold between parallel plates in three steps with the \nweld located either 0\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 from the line of direction of force \nas required in 9.2. During the first step, which is a test for \nductility of the weld, no cracks or breaks on the inside or \noutside surfaces shall occur before the distance between the \nplates is less than two thirds of the original outside diameter of \nthe pipe. As a second step, the flattening shall be continued. \nDuring the second step, which is a test for ductility exclusive \nof the weld, no cracks or breaks on the inside or outside \nsurfaces shall occur before the distance between the plates is \nless than one third of the original outside diameter of the pipe \nbut is not less than five times the wall thickness of the pipe. \nDuring the third step, which is a test for soundness, the \nflattening shall be continued until the specimen breaks or the \nopposite walls of the pipe meet. Evidence of laminated or \nunsound material or of incomplete weld that is revealed during \nthe entire flattening test shall be cause for rejection. \n9 .2 For pipe produced in single lengths, the flattening test \nspecified in 9 .1 shall be made on both crop ends cut from each \niength of pipe. The tests from each end shall be made \nalternately with the weld at 0\u00b0 and at 90\u00b0 from the line of \ndirection of force. For pipe produced in multiple lengths, the \nflattening test shall be made on crop ends representing the front \nand back of each coil with the weld at 90\u00b0 from the line of \ndirection of force, and on two intermediate rings representing \neach coil with the weld 0\u00b0 from the line of direction of force. \n188 \n9 .3 Surface imperfections in the test specimen before \nflattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening \ntest, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements \nin Section 13. \n9 .4 Superficial cracks as a result of surface imperfections \nshall not be cause for rejection. \n10. Hydrostatic Test \n10.1 Except as provided for in 10.3, each length of pipe \nshall be hydrostatically tested at the mill, without leakage \nthrough the wall, to a pressure calculated from the following \nequation: \nP = 2St/D \nwhere: \nP = minimum hydrostatic test pressure, psi, [kPa]. The test \npressure need not exceed 2500 psi [17 200 kPa], \nS = allowable fiber stress 18 000 psi [124 000 kPa] for \nGrade A and 21 000 psi [145 000 kPa] for Grade B. \nThis does not prohibit testing at higher pressure at the \nmanufacturer's option, \nt = specified wall thickness, in. [mm], and \nD = specified outside diameter, in. [mm]. \nPlain end pipe may be tested at the discretion of the \nmanufacturer in single lengths or in multiple lengths. \n10.2 The hydrostatic pressure shall be maintained for not \nless than 5 s. \n10.3 When specified in the order, pipe may be furnished \nwithout hydrostatic testing, and each length so furnished shall \ninclude with the mandatory marking the letters \"NH.\" \nNam 3-This provision is not intended to apply to light wall (Schedule \n10) pipe listed in Table Xl.1. \n10.4 When certification is required by the purchaser and the \nhydrostatic test has been omitted, the certification shall clearly \nstate \"Not Hydrostatically Tested.\" The specification number \nand material grade, as shown on the certification, shall be \nfollowed by the letters \"NH.\" \n11. Nondestructive Examination Reqnirements \n11.1 As an alternate to the hydrostatic test, and when \naccepted by the purchaser, each pipe shall be tested with a \nnondestructive electric test. Except for pipe produced on a \nhot-stretch reducing mill, the weld seam of each length of pipe \nshall be tested with a nondestructive test in accordance with \nPractices E213, E273, E309, or E570. Each length of pipe \nproduced on a hot-stretch-reducing mill shall be tested with a \nnondestructive electric test that inspects the full volume of the \npipe in accordance with Practices E213, E309, or E570. \n11.2 Recognized methods for meeting this test are electro\u00ad\nmagnetic (eddy current) or ultrasonic. \n11.3 The following information is for the benefit of the user \nof this specification: \n11.3.1 The ultrasonic examination referred to in this speci\u00ad\nfication is intended to detect longitudinal imperfections having \na reflective area similar to or larger than the reference notch.
