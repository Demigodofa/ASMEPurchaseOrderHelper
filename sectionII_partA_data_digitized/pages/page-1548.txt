SA 0 999 /SA-999M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
28.2 Pipe shall be ordered to nominal pipe size (NPS) and 
schedule. Nominal pipe shall be as specified in ANSI B36.10 or 
B36.19. 
28.3 Responsibility for Inspection-Unless otherwise speci­
fied in the contract or purchase order, the manufacturer is 
responsible for the performance of all inspection and test 
requirements specified. The absence of any inspection require­
ments in the specification shall not relieve the contractor of the 
responsibility for ensuring that all products or supplies submit­
ted to the government for acceptance comply with all require­
ments of the contract or purchase order. Sampling inspection, 
as part of the manufacturing operations, is an acceptable 
practice to asceiiain conformance to requirements; however, 
this does not authorize submission of known defective 
material, either indicated or actual, nor does it commit the 
government to accept the material. Except as otherwise speci­
fied in the contract or purchase order, the manufacturer may 
use its own or any other suitable facilities for the performance 
of the inspection and test requirements unless disapproved by 
the purchaser at the time the order is placed. The purchaser 
shall have the right to perform any of the inspections and tests 
set forth if such inspections and tests are deemed necessary to 
ensure that the products confonn to the prescribed require­
ments. 
28.4 Sampling for Flattening and Flaring Test and for 
Visual and Dimensional Examination-Minimum sampling for 
flattening and flaring tests and visual and dimensional exami­
nation shall be as follows: 
Lot Size (Pieces per Lot) Sample Size 
2 to 8 Entire Lot 
9 to 90 8 
91 to 150 12 
151 to 280 19 
281 to 500 21 
501 to 1200 27 
1201 to 3200 35 
3201 to 1 O 000 38 
10 001 to 35 000 46 
In alI cases, the acceptance number is zero and the rejection 
number is one. Rejected lots may be screened and resubmitted 
for visual and dimensional examination. All defective items 
shall be replaced with acceptable items prior to lot acceptance. 
28.5 Sampling for Chemical Analysis-One sample for 
chemical analysis shall be selected from each two pipes chosen 
from each lot. A lot shall be all material poured from one heat. 
28.6 Sampling for Tension and Bend Test-One sample shall 
be taken from each lot. A lot shall consist of all pipe of the 
sante outside diameter and wall thickness manufactured during 
an 8-h shift from the same heat of steel, and heat treated under 
the same conditions of temperature and time in a single charge 
in a batch-type furnace, or heat treated under the same 
condition in a continuous furnace, and presented for inspection 
at the same time. 
28.7 Hydrostatic and Ultrasonic Tests-Each pipe shall be 
tested by the ultrasonic (if specified) and hydrostatic tests. 
28.8 Pipe shall be free from heavy oxide or scale. The 
internal surface of hot finished ferritic steel pipe shall be 
pickled or blast cleaned to a free of scale condition equivalent 
to the CSa2 visual standard in SSPC-SP6. Cleaning shall be 
performed in accordance with a written procedure that has been 
shown to be effective. This procedure shall be available for 
audit. 
28.9 In addition to the marking required by this 
specification, each length of pipe NPS ¼ or larger shall be 
marked, in accordance with FED-STD-183 and MIL-STD- 792, 
with the nominal pipe size, schedule number, length, and heat 
number or lot identification number. 
28.10 Pipe shall be straight to within the tolerance given in 
Table 2. 
28.11 If specified, each pipe shall be ultrasonically exam­
ined in accordance with MIL-STD-271, except that the notch 
depth in the reference standard shall be 5 % of the wall 
thickness or 0.005 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is the greater. Any 
pipe that produces an indication equal to or greater than 100 % 
of the indication from the reference discontinuity shall be 
rejected. 
28.12 The pipe shall be free from repair welds, welded 
joints, laps, laminations, seams, visible cracks, tears, grooves, 
slivers, pits, and other imperfections detrimental to the pipe as 
determined by visual and ultrasonic examination, or alternate 
tests, as specified. 
28.13 Pipe shall be uniform in quality and condition and 
have a finish conforming to the best practice for standard 
quality pipe. Surface imperfections such as handling marks, 
straightening marks, light mandrel and die marks, shallow pits, 
and scale pattern will not be considered defects if the imper­
fections are removable within the tolerances specified for wall 
thickness or 0.005 in. [0.1 mm], whichever is the greater. The 
bottom of imperfections shall be visible and the profile shall be 
rounded and faired-in. 
28.14 No weld repair by the manufacturer is permitted. 
28.15 Preservation shall be level A or commercial, and 
packing shall be level A, B, or commercial, as specified. Level 
A preservation and level A or B packing shall be in accordance 
with MIL-STD-163 and commercial preservation and packing 
shall be in accordance with Practices A700 or Practice D3951.
