SA-450/SA-450M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
where: 
H = distance between flattening plates, in. [mm], 
t = specified wall thickness of the tube, in. [mm], 
D = specified outside diameter of the tube, in. [mm], and 
e = deformation per unit length (constant for a given grade 
of steel: 0.07 for medium-carbon steel (maximum 
specified carbon 0.19 % or greater), 0.08 for low alloy 
steel, and 0.09 for low-carbon steel (maximum speci­
fied carbon 0.18 % or less)). 
During the second step, which is a test for soundness, the 
flattening shall be continued until the specimen breaks or the 
opposite walls of the tube meet. Evidence of laminated or 
unsound material, or of incomplete weld that is revealed during 
the entire flattening test shall be cause for rejection. 
19.2 Surface imperfections in the test specimens before 
flattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening 
test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements. 
19.3 Superficial ruptures resulting from surface imperfec­
tions shall not be cause for rejection. 
19.4 When low D-to-t ratio tubular products are tested, 
because the strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably 
high on the inside surface at the six and twelve o'clock 
locations, cracks at these locations shall not be cause for 
rejection if the D to t ratio is less than 10. 
20. Reverse Flattening Test 
20.1 A 5 in. [100 mm] in length of finished welded tubing in 
sizes down to and including ½ in. [12.7 mm] in outside 
diameter shall be split longitudinally 90° on each side of the 
weld and the sample opened and flattened with the weld at the 
point of maximum bend. There shall be no evidence of cracks 
or lack of penetration or overlaps resulting from flash removal 
in the weld. 
21. Flaring Test 
21.1 A section of tube approximately 4 in. [100 mm] in 
length shall stand being flared with a tool having a 60° included 
angle until the tube at the mouth of the flare has been expanded 
to the percentages specified in Table 5 without cracking or 
showing imperfections rejectable under the provisions of the 
product specification.

A In determining the ratio of inside diameter to specified outside diameter, the 
inside diameter shall be defined as the actual mean inside diameter of the material 
tested. 
22. Flange Test 
22.1 A section of tube shall be capable of having a flange 
turned over at a right angle to the body of the tube without 
cracking or showing imperfections rejectable under the provi­
sions of the product specification. The width of the flange for 
carbon and alloy steels shall be not less than the percentages 
specified in Table 6. 
23. Hardness Test 
23.1 For tubes 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] and over in wall 
thickness, either the Brinell or Rockwell hardness test shall be 
used. When Brinell hardness testing is used, a 10-mm ball with 
3000, 1500, or 500-kg load, or a 5-mm ball with 750-kg load 
may be used, at the option of the manufacturer. 
742 
23.2 For tubes less than 0.200 in. [5.1 mm] to and including 
0.065 in. [1.7 mm] in wall thickness, the Rockwell hardness 
test shall be used. 
23.3 For tubes less than 0.065 in. [1.7 mm] in wall 
thickness, the hardness test shall not be required. 
23.4 The Brinell hardness test may be made on the outside 
of the tube near the end, on the outside of a specimen cut from 
the tube, or on the wall cross section of a specimen cut from the 
tube at the option of the manufacturer. This test shall be made 
so that the distance from the center of the impression to the 
edge of the specimen is at least 2.5 times the diameter of the 
impression. 
23.5 The Rockwell hardness test may be made on the inside 
surface, on the wall cross section, or on a flat on the outside 
surface at the option of the manufacturer. 
23.6 For tubes furnished with upset, swaged, or otherwise 
formed ends, the hardness test shall be made as prescribed in 
23.1 and 23.2 on the outside of the tube near the end after the 
forming operation and heat treatment. 
23.7 For welded or brazed tubes, the hardness test shall be 
made away from the joints. 
23.8 When the product specification provides for Vickers 
hardness, such testing shall be in accordance with Test Method 
E92. 
24. Hydrostatic Test 
24.1 Except as provided in 24.2 and 24.3, each tube shall be 
tested by the manufacturer to a minimum hydrostatic test 
pressure determined by the following equation: 
Inch - Pound Units: P = 32000 t/D 
SI Units: P = 220.6t/D
