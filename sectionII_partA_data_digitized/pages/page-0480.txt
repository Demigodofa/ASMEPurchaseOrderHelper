SA-285/SA-285M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Carbon Steel, Low- and 
Intermediate-Tensile Strength 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers carbon steel plates of low­
and intermediate-tensile strengths which may be killed or 
semi-killed at the producer's option. These plates are intended 
for fusion-welded pressure vessels. 
1.2 Plates under this specification are available in three 
grades having different strength levels as follows: 
Grade Tensile Strength, ksi [MPa] 
A 45-65 [310-450] 
B 50-70 [345-485] 
C 55-75 [380-515] 
1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited by the 
capacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
NoTE 1-For killed carbon steels only, refer to the following ASTM 
specifications: 
A299/A299M Specification for Pressure Vessel Plates, Carbon Steel, 
Manganese-Silicon 
A5!5/A515M Specification for Pressure Vessel Plates, Carbon Steel, 
for Intermediate- and Higher-Temperature Service 
A5 l 6/ A5 l 6M Specification for Pressure Vessel Plates, Carbon Steel, 
for Moderate- and Lower-Temperature Service 
1.4 For plates produced from coil and furnished without 
heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the additional 
requirements, including additional testing requirements and the 
reporting of additional test results, of Specification A20/A20M 
apply. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
428 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi­
cation. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3 .1 Material supplied to this material specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit­
ted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the
