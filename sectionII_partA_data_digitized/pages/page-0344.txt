SA-213/SA-213M (ASTM A213/A213M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the 
inquiry, contract, or order. 
Sl. Stress-Relieved Annealed Tubes 
S 1.1 For use in certain corrosives, particularly chlorides 
where stress corrosion may occur, tubes in Grades TP304L, 
TP316L, TP321, TP347, and TP348 may be specified in the 
stress-relieved annealed condition. 
Sl.2 When stress-relieved tubes are specified, tubes shall be 
given a heat treatment at 1500 to 1650 °F [815 to 900 °C] after 
roll straightening. Cooling from this temperature range may be 
either in air or by slow cooling. No mechanical straightening is 
permitted after the stress-relief treatment. 
Sl.3 Straightness of the tubes shall be a matter of negotia­
tion between the purchaser and supplier. 
S2. Stabilizing Heat Treatment 
S2.1 Subsequent to the solution anneal required in Section 
6, Grades TP309HCb, TP310HCb, TP310HCbN, TP321, 
TP321H, TP347, TP347H, TP348, and TP348H shall be given 
a stabilization heat treatment at a temperature lower than that 
used for the initial solution annealing heat treatment. The 
temperature of stabilization heat treatment shall be at a 
temperature as agreed upon between the purchaser and vendor. 
S3. Unstraightened Tubes 
S3 .1 When the purchaser specifies tubes unstraightened 
after final heat treatment (such as coils), the minimum yield 
strength of Table 4 shall be reduced by 5 ksi [35 MPa]. 
S3.2 On the certification, and wherever the grade designa­
tion for unstraightened tubing appears, it shall be identified 
with the suffix letter "U" (for example, 304-U, 321-U, etc.). 
S4. lntergranular Corrosion Test 
S4.1 When specified, material shall pass intergranular cor­
rosion tests conducted by the manufacturer in accordance with 
Practices A262, Practice E. 
Norn S4.1-Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condition for 
low carbon or stabilized grades, and on the as-shipped condition for other 
grades. 
S4.2 A stabilization heat treatment in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement S2 may be necessary and is 
permitted in order to meet this requirement for the grades 
containing titanium or columbium, particularly in their H 
versions. 
SS. Minimum Cooling Rate for Grade T91 Type 2 
S5.l For Grade T91 Type 2 material, the heat treatment 
shall ensure that following austenitizing the rate of cooling 
from 1650 °F to 900 °F [900 °C to 480 °C] is no slower than 
9 °F/min [5 °C/ min]. 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
