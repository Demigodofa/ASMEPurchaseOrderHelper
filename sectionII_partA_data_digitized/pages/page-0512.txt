SA-312/SA-312M (ASTM A312/A312M) ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
shall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise 
specified in the purchase order. 
12.2 The hydrostatic test shall be in accordance with Speci­
fication A999/A999M, unless specifically exempted under the 
provisions of 12.3. 
12.3 For pipe whose dimensions equal or exceed NPSlO, 
the purchaser, with the agreement of the manufacturer, is 
permitted to waive the hydrostatic test requirement when in 
lieu of such test the purchaser performs a system test. Each 
length of pipe furnished without the completed manufacturer's 
hydrostatic test shall include with the mandatory markings the 
letters "NH." 
12.4 The nondestructive electric test shall be in accordance 
with Specification A999/A999M. 
13. Lengths 
13.1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following 
regular practice: 
13.1.1 Unless otherwise agreed upon, all sizes from NPS 
1/s to and including NPS 8 are available in a length up to 24 ft 
with the permitted range of 15 to 24 ft. Short lengths are 
acceptable and the number and minimum length shall be 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
13.1.2 If definite cut lengths ate desired, the lengths re­
quired shall be specified in the order. No pipe shall be under the 
specified length and no pipe shall be more than ¼ in. [6 mm] 
over the specified length. 
13.1.3 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise specified. 
14. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
14.1 The finished pipes shall be reasonably straight and 
shall have a workmanlike finish. Removal of imperfections by 
grinding is permitted, provided the wall thicknesses are not 
decreased to less than that permitted in the Permissible 
Variations in Wall Thickness section of Specification A999/ 
A999M. 
15. Repair by Welding 
15.1 For welded pipe whose diameter equals or exceeds 
NPS 6, and whose nominal wall thickness equals or exceeds 
0.200, it is permitted to make weld repairs to the weld seam 
with the addition of compatible filler metal using the same 
procedures specified for plate defects in the section on Repair 
by Welding of Specification A999/ A999M. 
15.2 Weld repairs of the weld seam shall not exceed 20 % of 
the seam length. 
15.3 Weld repairs shall be made only with the gas tungsten­
arc welding process using the same classification of bare filler 
rod qualified to the most currentAWS SpecificationA5.9 as the 
grade of stainless steel pipe being repaired and as shown in 
Table 6. Alternatively, subject to approval by the purchaser, 
weld repairs shall be made only with the gas tungsten-arc 
welding process using a filler metal more highly alloyed than 
the base metal when needed for corrosion resistance or other 
properties. 
15 .4 Pipes that have had weld seam repairs with filler metal 
shall be uniquely identified and shall be so stated and identified

the certificate of tests. 
16. Certification 
16.1 In addition to the information required by Specification 
A999/ A999M, the certification shall state whether or not the 
material was hydrostatically tested. If the material was nonde­
structively tested, the certification shall so state and shall state 
which standard practice was followed and what reference 
discontinuities were used.
