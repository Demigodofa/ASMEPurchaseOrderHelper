  "text": "SA-480/SA-480M (ASTM A480/A480M} ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 \nnot listed in the product specification, when acknowledged in \nthe order acceptance, shall be treated as a specified element, \nwith determination of chemical analysis and reporting of that \nanalysis. \n6.2.4 The purchaser is permitted to make the requirements \nfor any element more stringent; that is, require higher mini\u00ad\nmums for elements having minimum requirements or ranges \nwith minimum requirements, or requiring lower maximums for \nelements having specified maximums, or ranges with maxi\u00ad\nmums. The purchaser is not permitted to make chemical \nrequirements less stringent. \n6.2.5 Analysis limits shall be established for specific \nelements rather than groups of elements, including but not \nlimited to all others, rare earths, and balance, unless all \nelements in such a group are similar in technical effect and are \nassociated in typical methods of chemical analysis. \n6.3 Except as permitted in 6.3.1, the steel shall not contain \nan unspecified element for the ordered grade to the extent that \nthe steel conforms to the requirements of another grade for \nwhich that element is a specified element having a required \nminimum content. For this requirement, a grade is defined as \nan alloy described individually and identified by its own UNS \ndesignation in a table of chemical requirements within this \nspecification or any specification listed within the scope as \nbeing covered by the specification. \n6.3.1 Unless otherwise specified to lower maximum limits \non the purchase order, maximum allowances for unspecified \nelements will be established for Cu, Mo, Ti, and Nb for the \nspecified grade if the amount of that element present in the \nmaterial conforms with composition limits for that element in \nanother grade. These allowances are Cu, 0.75 %; Mo, 0.75 %; \nTi, 0.10 %; and Nb, 0.10 %. \n6.3.2 If any allowance in 6.3.1 is used to demonstrate \nnon-substitution, then the element involved shall be reported as \nif it were a specified element. \n6.4 The producer is not permitted to certify that material is \nin compliance with an ASTM product specification when the \npurchase order has required that the material contain as a \nminimum or range an element that is neither a specified \nelement nor an intentionally added unspecified element for the \nordered grade in accordance with the definitions of Test \nMethods, Practices, and Terminology A751. \n6.5 The names columbium (Cb) and niobium (Nb) both \nrefer to element 41. The name Niobium is preferred, but either \nis acceptable for reporting composition. \n7. Product Analysis \n7.1 The purchaser is permitted to perform a product analysis \n(formerly check analysis) to verify the identity of the finished \nmaterial representing each heat or lot. Such analysis shall be \nmade by any of the commonly accepted methods that will \npositively identify the material. \n7.2 The chemical composition determined in accordance \nwith 7 .1 shall conform to the limits of the material specification \nwithin the tolerances of Table Al .1, unless otherwise specified \nin the applicable material specification or the purchase order. \nThe allowable variation of a particular element in a single \nsample for product analysis is permitted to be either above or \nbelow the specified range. However, percentages must exhibit \nthe same tendencies in all samples; that is, the several \ndeterminations of any individual element in a heat shall not \nvary both above and below the specified range. \n8. Material Test Report and Certification \n8 .1 A report of the results of all tests required by the product \nspecification shall be supplied to the purchaser. This material \ntest report shall reference the product specification designation \nand year date indicating that the material was manufactured, \nsampled, tested, and inspected in accordance with requirements \nof the product specification and has been found to meet those \nrequirements. The material test report shall report the melting \nprocess when the purchase order requires either a specific type \nof melting or requires that the melting process used is to be \nreported. \n8.1.1 The report shall indicate the type of steel. If certifying \nthat the material conforms to the requirements for more than \none type of steel, the manufacturer may indicate each type of \nsteel on the report, or may issue a separate report for each type \nof steel. \n8.2 A signature is not required on the report. However, the \ndocument shall clearly identify the organization submitting the \nreport. Not withstanding the absence of a signature, the \norganization submitting the document is responsible for its \ncontent. \n8.3 A material test report, certificate of inspection, or similar \ndocument printed from or used in electronic form from an \nelectronic data interchange (EDI) transmission shall be re\u00ad\ngarded as having the same validity as a counterpart printed in \nthe certifiers' facility. The content of the EDI transmitted \ndocument must meet the requirements of the invoked ASTM \nstandard(s) and conform to any existing EDI agreement be\u00ad\ntween the purchaser and the supplier. Notwithstanding the \nabsence of a signature, the organization submitting the EDI \ntransmission is responsible for the content of the report. \n788 \n8.4 When finished material is supplied to a purchase order \nspecifying the product specification, the organization supply\u00ad\ning that material shall provide the purchaser with a copy of the \noriginal manufacturer's test report. \nNorn 1-Notwithstanding the absence of a signature, the organization \nsubmitting the report is responsible for the content of the report. \nNorn 2-The industry definition of EDI invoked herein is the \ncomputer-to-computer exchange of business information in a standard \nformat such as ANSI ASC X12. \n8.4.1 When the original manufacturer's test report was \nprovided by EDI to the organization supplying the finished \nmaterial to the purchaser, the organization supplying the \nfinished material shall provide to the purchaser a printed form \nof the original test report or shall retransmit the test report by \nEDI to the purchaser. In either case, the test report shall be \ncomplete with the full identification of the original manufac\u00ad\nturer and with all data provided on the test report of the original \nmanufacturer. ",
