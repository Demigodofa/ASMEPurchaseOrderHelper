The marking shall \nalso include the manufacturer's private identifying mark, the \nmarking requirement of 12.3, if applicable, and whether \nseamless (SML), welded (WLD), or heavily cold-worked \n(HCW). For Grades TP304H, TP316H, TP321H, TP347H, \nTP348H, and S30815, the marking shall also include the heat \nnumber and heat-treatment lot identification. If specified in the \npurchase order, the marking for pipe larger than NPS 4 shall \ninclude the weight. \n18. Government Procurement \n18.1 Scale Free Pipe for Government Procurement: \n18.1.1 When specified in the contract or order, the following \nrequirements shall be considered in the inquiry, contract or \norder, for agencies of the U.S. Government where scale free \npipe or tube is required. These requirements shall take prece\u00ad\ndence if there is a conflict between these requirements and the \nproduct specifications. \n18.1.2 The requirements of Specification A999/ A999M for \npipe and Specification Al016/Al016M for tubes shall be \napplicable when pipe or tube is ordered to this specification. \n18.1.3 Pipe and tube shall be one of the following grades as \nspecified herein: \nGrade \nTP304 \nTP304L \nTP304N \nTP316 \nTP316L \nTP316N \nUNS Designation \n830400 \n830403 \n830451 \n831600 \n831603 \n831651 \nTP317 \nTP317L \nTP321 \nTP347 \n18.1.4 Part Number: \n831700 \n831703 \n832100 \n834700 \nExample: ASTM A312/A312M Pipe 304 NPS 12 SCH 40S \nSMLS \nSpecification Number ASTM A312 \nPipe p \nGrade 304 \nNPS 12 \nWall 0.375 \nSMLS OR WELDED SML \n18.1.4.1 \nSpecification Number ASTM A312 \nTube T \nGrade 304 \nOutside Diameter 0.250 \nWall 0.035 \nSMLS OR WELDED WLD \n18.1.5 Ordering Information-Orders for material under \nthis specification shall include the following in addition to the \nrequirements of Section 4: \n18.1.5.1 Pipe or tube, \n18.1.5.2 Part number, \n18.1.5.3 Ultrasonic inspection, if required, \n18.1.5.4 If shear wave test is to be conducted in two \nopposite circumferential directions, \n18.1.5.5 Intergranular corrosion test, and \n18.1.5.6 Level of preservation and packing required. \n19. Keywords \n19 .1 austenitic stainless steel; seamless steel pipe; stainless \nsteel pipe; steel pipe; welded steel pipe \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nOne or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the \npurchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided \nin the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, \nretest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. \nSl. Product Analysis \nS 1.1 For all pipe NPS 5 and larger in nominal size there shall \nbe one product analysis made of a representative sample from \none piece for each ten lengths or fraction thereof from each \nheat of steel. \nS 1.2 For pipe smaller than NPS 5 there shall be one product \nanalysis made from ten lengths per heat of steel or from 10 % \nof the number of lengths per heat of steel, whichever number \nis smaller. \nSl.3 Individual lengths failing to conform to the chemical \nrequirements specified in Section 7 shall be rejected. \nS2. Transverse Tension Tests \nS2. l There shall be one transverse tension test made from \none end of 10 % of the lengths furnished per heat of steel. This \nrequirement is applicable only to pipe NPS 8 and larger. \n461 \nS2.2 If a specimen from any length fails to conform to the \ntensile properties specified that length shall be rejected. \nS3. Flattening Test \nS3.l The flattening test of Specification A999/A999M shall \nbe made on a specimen from one end or both ends of each pipe. \nCrop ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is \nspecified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. \nIf a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility \nprior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening \ntest requirement, that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat\u00ad\nment in accordance with Specification A999/A999M and \nsatisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length of pipe fails \nbecause of a lack of soundness that length shall be rejected, \nunless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length \nis sound. ",
