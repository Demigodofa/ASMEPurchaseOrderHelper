ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-266/SA-266M 
discard shall be made to secure freedom from injurious pipe 
and undue segregation. 
4.2 The material shall be forged as close as practical to the 
specified shape and size. 
4.3 The finished product shall be a hot-worked forging as 
defined by Specification A788/A788M. 
5. Machining 
5.1 Surfaces shall be machined as designated by the pur­
chaser. Unmachined surfaces shall be sufficiently free of scale 
to permit inspection. 
5.2 Machining may be performed either prior to or after heat 
treatment at the option of the manufacturer unless specified in 
accordance with Supplementary Requirement S 1. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 After forging and before reheating for heat treatment, 
the forgings shall be cooled in such a manner as to prevent 
injury and to accomplish transformation. 
6.2 All forgings shall be annealed, normalized, or normal­
ized and tempered, but alternatively may be liquid quenched 
and tempered when mutually agreed upon between the manu­
facturer and the purchaser. When tempering is performed, it 
shall be at a subcritical temperature, but no less than 1100 ~F 
[595 °C], 
6.3 A multiple stage austenitizing procedure may be used 
whereby the forging is first fully austenitized and liquid 
quenched, followed by reheating within the intercritical tem­
perature range to partially reaustenitize, and again liquid 
quenched. On completion of the austenitizing/quenching 
cycles, tempering at a temperature between ll00 °F [595 °C] 
and the lower critical temperature shall follow. 
NoTE 2-Although liquid quenching from the austenitizing tempera­
tures is more effective in enhancing impact properties, air cooling from the 
austenitizing temperatures is also beneficial and may be used instead of 
the normalizing procedure in 6.2. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam­
pling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall 
comply with Table 1 except that the additional features of 
Supplementary Requirements Sll and S12 shall also apply as 
individually specified in the ordering information. 
7 .2 Product Analysis-The purchaser may use the product 
analysis provision of Specification A788/A788M to obtain a 
product analysis from a forging representing each heat or 
multiple heat.

8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 General Requirements-Except when otherwise speci­
fied in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S2, the 
material shall conform to the requirements for mechanical 
properties prescribed in Table 2 when tested in accordance with 
the latest issue of Test Methods and Definitions A370 or Test 
Methods Al058 when the M suffix standard has been specified. 
The largest obtainable tension test specimen as specified in Test 
Methods and Definitions A370 or Test Methods A1058, as 
applicable, shall be used. 
8.1.1 Except when otherwise specified in accordance with 
Supplementary Requirement S2, the longitudinal axis of the 
specimens shall be parallel to the direction of major working of 
the forging. For upset-disc forgings, the longitudinal axis of the 
test specimen shall be in the tangential direction. 
8.1.1.1 The longitudinal axis of the specimen shall be 
located midway between the parallel surfaces of the test 
extension if added to the periphery of disks or midway between 
the center and surface of solid forgings. For hollow forgings, or 
those heat-treated after boring, the specimen shall be located at 
midwall. For the special case of forgings that are heat-treated 
solid, but are subsequently bored, the tension test specimen 
may be taken at the location of the minimum inside diameter 
after boring instead of the mid-radius position. When sepa­
rately forged test blocks are employed as defined in 8.1.3, the 
tension test specimens shall be taken from a location that 
represents the midwall of the heaviest section of the production 
forgings. When specimens are required from opposite ends, 
they shall be taken from the diagonal comers of an axial plane. 
8.1.2 Except as specified herein, tests for acceptance shall 
be made after heat treatment has been completed. When the 
ends of the cylindrical forgings are closed in by reforging, the 
cylindrical forgings may be annealed, normalized, or normal­
ized and tempered and tested prior to reforging. After 
reforging, the entire forging shall be reheat-treated in the same 
manner and at the same temperature range as employed when 
the forging was heat-treated prior to certification testing. 
8.1.3 When mutually agreed upon between manufacturer 
and purchaser, test specimens may be machined from a 
specially forged block suitably worked and heat-treated with 
the production forgings. Such a special block shall be obtained 
from an ingot, slab, or billet from the same heat used to make 
the forgings it represents. This block shall receive essentially 
the same type of hot working and forging reduction as the 
production forgings; however, a longitudinally forged bar with 
dimensions not less than T by T by 3 T may be used to represent 
a ring forging. The dimension T shall be representative of the 
heaviest effective cross section of the forging. For quenched
