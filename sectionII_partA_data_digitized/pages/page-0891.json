Permitted Variations in Dimensions and Weight \n9.1 Sheet, strip, and plate shall conform to the permitted \nvariations in thickness, width, length and flatness, and other \nproperties when specified, as listed in Annex A2 and Annex A3 \nfor A480 and A480M respectively, for the ordered product \nform, or as agreed upon by seller and user and specified in the \npurchase order. \n10. Workmanship \n10.1 The material shall be of uniform quality consistent \nwith good manufacturing and inspection practices. The steel \nshall have no imperfections of a nature or degree, for the type \nand quality ordered, that will adversely affect the stamping, \nforming, machining, or fabrication of finished parts. \n10.2 Sheet, Strip, and Plate-For sheet and strip, restricted \nonly to material ordered to have a No. 1 finish in accordance \nwith 11.1.1 and 12.1.1 respectively, and for plate restricted to \nmaterial ordered to hot-rolled and annealed or hot-rolled, \nannealed, and pickle finish in accordance with 13 .1.1 and \n13.1.2 respectively, it is permitted to grind to remove surface \nimperfections, provided such grinding does not reduce the \nthickness or width at any point beyond the permissible varia\u00ad\ntions in dimensions. An iron free abrasive wheel shall be used \nfor such grinding and shall be operated at a speed ample to \nensure that defective areas are cleanly cut out. \n11. Finish for Sheet \n11.1 The types of finish available on sheet products are: \n11.1.1 No. 1 Finish-Hot-rolled, annealed, and descaled. \n11.1.2 No. 2D Finish-Cold-rolled, dull finish. \n11.1.3 No. 2B Finish-Cold-rolled, bright finish. \n11.1.3 .1 . Bright Annealed Finish-A bright cold-rolled finish \nretained by final annealing in a controlled atmosphere furnace. \n11.1.4 No. 3 Finish-Intermediate polished finish, one or \nboth sides. \n11. 1.5 No. 4 Finish-General purpose polished finish, one \nor both sides. \n11.1.6 No. 6 Finish-Dull satin finish, Tampico brushed, \none or both sides. \n11.1.7 No. 7 Finish-High luster finish. \n11.1.8 No. 8 Finish-Mirror finish. \n11.1.9 TR Finish-Cold-worked to obtain specified proper\u00ad\nties. \nNorn 3-Explanation of Sheet Finishes: \nNo. I-Commonly referred to as hot-rolled annealed and pickled or \ndescaled. This is a dull, nonreflective finish. \nNo. 2D-A smooth, nonreflective cold-rolled annealed and pickled or \ndescaled finish. This nondirectional finish is favorable for retention of \nlubricants in deep drawing applications. \nNo. 2B-A smooth, moderately reflective cold-rolled annealed and \npickled or descaled finish typically produced by imparting a final light \ncold-rolled pass using polished rolls. This general-purpose finish is more \nreadily polished than No. 1 or 2D finishes. Product with 2B finish is \nnormally supplied in the annealed plus lightly cold-rolled condition unless \na tensile-rolled product is specified. \nBright Annealed Finish-A smooth, bright, reflective finish typically \nproduced by cold rolling followed by annealing in a protective atmosphere \nso as to prevent oxidation and scaling during annealing. \nNo. 3-A linearly textured finish that may be produced by either \nmechanical polishing or rolling. Average surface roughness (R,,) may \ngenerally be up to 40 \u00b5in. A skilled operator can generally blend this \nfinish. Surface roughness measurements differ with different instruments, \nlaboratories, and operators. There may also be overlap in measurements of \nsurface roughness for both Nos. 3 and 4 finishes. \nNo. 4-A linearly textured finish that may be produced by either \nmechanical polishing or rolling. Average surface roughness (R.) may \ngenerally be up to 25 \u00b5in. A skilled operator can generally blend this \nfinish. Surface roughness measurements differ with different instruments, \nlaboratories, and operators. There may also be overlap in measurements of \nsurface roughness for both Nos. 3 and 4 finishes. \nNo. 6-This finish has a soft, satin appearance typically produced by \ntampico brushing a No. 4 finish. \nNo. 7-Has a high degree of reflectivity. It is produced by buffing a \nfinely ground surface, but the grit lines are not removed. It is chiefly used \nfor architectural or ornamental purposes. \nNo. 8-This is a highly reflective, smooth finish typically produced by \npolishing with successively finer grit abrasives, then buffing. Typically, \nvery faint buff of polish lines may still be visible on the final product. \nBlending after part assembly may be done with buffing. \nTR Finish-The finish resulting from the cold-rolling of an annealed \nand descaled or bright annealed product to obtain mechanical properties \nhigher than that of the annealed condition. Appearance will vary depend\u00ad\ning upon the starting finish, amount of cold work, and the alloy. \nArchitectural Finishes-Sometimes described as a No. 5 finish, these \nare a separate category and may be negotiated between buyer and seller, \nas there are many techniques and finish variations available throughout the \nworld. \n11.1.10 Architectural finish, No. 5, or other proprietary \nnames are special finishes. \n11.1.11 Note 3 is not meant to be restrictive or to be used as \na basis for rejection but is intended to give general guidelines. \nVarious production methods may be used to obtain these \nfinishes. \n11.1.12 Sheets can be produced with one or two sides \npolished. When polished on one side only, it is permitted to \nrough grind the other side in order to obtain the necessary \nflatness. \n12. Finish for Strip \n12.1 The various types of finish procurable on cold-rolled \nstrip products are: \n12.1.1 No. 1 Finish-Cold-rolled to specified thickness, \nannealed, and descaled. \n12.1.2 No. 2 Finish-Same as No. 1 finish, followed by a \nfinal light cold-roll pass, generally on highly polished rolls. \n12.1.3 Bright Annealed Finish-A bright cold-rolled finish \nretained by final annealing in a controlled atmosphere furnace. \n12.1.4 TR Finish-Cold-worked to obtain specified proper\u00ad\nties. \n12.1.5 Polished Finish-Stainless steel strip is also avail\u00ad\nable in polished finishes such as Nos. 3 and 4, which are \nexplained in Note 3. \n789 \nNorn 4--Explanation of Strip Finishes: \nNo. I-Appearance of this finish varies from dull gray matte finish to \na fairly reflective surface, depending largely upon composition. This finish \nis used for severely drawn or formed parts, as well as for applications \nwhere the brighter No. 2 finish is not required, such as parts for heat \nresistance .. \nNo. 2-This finish has a smoother and more reflective surface, the \nappearance of which varies with composition. This is a general purpose \nfinish, widely used for household and automotive trim, tableware, utensils, \ntrays, and so forth. \nBright Annealed Finish-See Note 3. \nTR Finish-See Note 3. ",
