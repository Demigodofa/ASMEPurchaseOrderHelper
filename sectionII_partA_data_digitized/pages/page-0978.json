Mechanical Requirements \n7.1 Tension Tests: \n7 .1.1 Requirements-The plates as represented by the \ntension-test specimens shall conform to the requirements given \nin Table 2. \n7.1.2 Test Methods: \n7.1.2.1 The yield strength may be determined by the 0.2 % \noffset method or by the total extension under load of 0.5 % \nmethod. \n7.1.2.2 For plates 3/'4 in. [20 nun] and under in thickness, the \ntest specimen shall be the 1 \u00bd in. [40 mm] wide rectangular-test \nspecimen. \n7.1.2.3 For plates over \u00be in. [20 mm], either the full \nthickness rectangular-test specimen or the \u00bd in. [12.5 mm] \nround-test specimen may be used. \nOver 2.50 to 6 in.
