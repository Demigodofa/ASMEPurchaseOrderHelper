SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
The following supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the purchase order. A 
list of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser is included in 
Specification A703/A703M. Those which are ordinarily considered suitable for use with this 
specification are given below. Others enumerated in Specification A 703/ A 703M may be used with this 
specification upon agreement between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
Sl. Unspecified Elements 
S2. Destruction Tests 
S5. Radiographic Inspection 
S6. Liquid Penetrant Inspection 
S8. Charpy Impact Test 
SlO. Examination of Weld Preparation 
Sl0.1 Liquid penetrant examination of cavities prepared for 
welding shall be performed to verify removal of those discon­
tinuities found unacceptable by the inspection method specified 
for the casting. The method of performing liquid penetrant 
examination shall be in accordance with Practice El 65/ 
E165M. Unless other degrees of shrinkage or types of discon­
tinuities found in the cavities are specified, Type II, Internal 
Shrinkage, of Reference Photographs E125, of Degree 2 in 
sections up to 2 in. [50 mm] thick, and of Degree 3 in sections 
over 2 in. [50 mm] thick shall be acceptable. 
Sll. Post-Weld Heat Treatment 
Sll.1 Castings shall be given a post-weld solution heat 
treatment in accordance with Table 1. 
Sl2. Prior Approval of Major Weld Repairs 
Other supplementary requirements considered suitable for 
use with this specification are: 
S50. Estimating Ferrite Content 
S50.1 Ferrite contents shall be determined by point count 
(Test Method E562), by other quantitative metallographic 
methods such as image analysis, by measurement of magnetic 
response, or by other methods upon agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. Frequency of testing and 
location of tests shall be by agreement between the manufac­
turer and the purchaser. 
S51. Prior Approval of Weld Material 
S51.1 The purchaser must give approval of all weld filler 
materials to be used prior to any weld repairs. 
S52. Additional Requirements for Grade 6A 
S52.l Casting Thickness, T-The casting thickness, T, is the 
maximum thickness of the pressure-containing wall of the 
casting exclusive of padding added for directional 
solidification, flanges, appendages, and sections designated by 
the designer as noncritical. The order, inquiry, and drawing 
shall designate what the test dimension, T, is for the casting. 
S52.2 Charpy Impact Test-Charpy impact test properties 
shall be determined by testing a set of three Charpy V-notch 
impact specimens made from each heat of material. 
S52.2.1 The thickness of the test blocks used to create 
Charpy impact test specimens shall be equal to the casting 
thickness, T. Charpy impact test specimens shall be removed 
from a location at one-half the thickness of the test block. 
S52.2.2 When the thickness of the test block is less than or 
equal to 4 in. [100 mm], Charpy impact testing shall be 
performed at one of the test temperatures listed in Table S52.1. 
TABLE S52.1 Charpy Impact Testing of Base Material 
Norn 1-It is recommended that test temperature selection be deter­
mined based on the intended service temperature of the casting.

The test temperature shall be provided by the purchaser. If the 
test temperature is not specified, the test temperature used shall 
be -51 °F [-46 °C]. The average value of the three specimens 
shall not be less than specified in Table S52.1, with no more 
than one value permitted below the average minimum specified 
and no value permitted below the minimum specified for a 
single specimen. 
S52.2.3 When the thickness of the test block is greater than 
4 in. [100 mm], test temperature arid absorbed energy values 
shall be agreed upon between the purchaser and the manufac­
turer. 
S52.3 Corrosion Testing-A Test Methods G48 Method A 
ferric chloride pitting resistance test shall be performed for a 
duration of 24 h at 60 °C. 
S52.3.l The thickness of the test blocks used to create 
corrosion test specimens shall be equal to the casting thickness, 
T. Corrosion test specimens shall be removed from a location 
at one quarter the thickness of the test block. 
S52.3.2 When the thickness of the test block is less than or 
equal to 4 in. [100 mm], test specimens shall show no evidence 
of pitting when examined optically at 20x magnification, and 
have a weight loss of <4g/m 2 . 
S52.3.3 When the thickness of the test block is greater than 
4 in. [100 mm], test block size and acceptance criteria shall be 
agreed upon between the purchaser and the manufacturer.
