Drillings shall \nnot be used because of attendant loss of graphite. \n8. Tensile Requirements \n8.1 Iron used in supplying castings to this specification shall \nconform to the tensile requirements prescribed in Table 3 and \nTable 4. \n9.

The size of the test bar to be poured shall be \nselected by the purchaser using Table 5. In the event no choice \nis made, the selection will be made by the manufacturer. \n9.2 Separately cast test bars shall be heat treated in the same \nfurnace together with the castings represented. \n9.3 At the option of the manufacturer, test coupons may be \nremoved from the casting at a location agreed npon between \nthe manufacturer and purchaser. \n419 \n9.4 Castings weighing in excess of 2000 lb may be repre\u00ad\nsented either by separately cast test bars (9.l) or by integrally \ncast test bars having a cooling rate closely approximating that \nof the controlling section of the casting. \n9.5 For castings weighing in excess of 10 000 lb or having \na controlling section greater than 2 in., test bars may be \nremoved from the casting or integral projections having a cross \nsection no less than the controlling section. The minimum \ntensile strength requirement for tension tests performed on \neither of these test bars shall be 80 % of the specified class. \n10. Molding and Pouring Test Bars \n10.1 The test bars shall be cast in dried siliceous sand molds \nmaintained at approximately room temperature. A suitable \ndesign for a mold is shown in Fig. 1. \nTABLE 5 Separately Cast Test Bars for Use When a Specific \nCorrelation Has Not Been Established Between the Test Bar and \nthe Casting \nThickness of the Wall of the Controlling \nSection of the Casting, in.
