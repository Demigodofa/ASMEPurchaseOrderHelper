SA·484/SA-484M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
General Requirements for Stainless Steel Bars, Billets, and 
Forgings 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers general requirements that 
shall apply to wrought stainless steel bars, shapes, forgings, 
and billets or other semi-finished material (except wire) for 
forging, under each of the following specifications issued by 
ASTM: Specifications A276/A276M, A314, A458, A477, 
A479/A479M, A564/A564M, A565/A565M, A582/A582M, 
A638/A638M, A705/A705M, and A831/A831M. 
1.2 In the case of conflict between a requirement of a 
product specification and a requirement of this specification, 
the product specification shall prevail. In the case of conflict 
between a requirement of the product specification or a 
requirement of this specification and a more stringent require­
ment of the purchase order, the purchase order shall prevail. 
The purchase order requirements shall not take precedence if 
they, in any way, violate the requirements of the product 
specification or this specification; for example, by waiving a 
test requirement or by making a test requirement less stringent. 
1.3 The requirements for introduction of new materials in 
specifications referencing this specification are given in Annex 
Al. 
1.4 General requirements for flat-rolled stainless steel prod­
ucts other than bar are covered in Specification A480/ A480M. 
1.5 General requirements for wire products in coils are 
covered in Specification A555/A555M. 
1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other, and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined 
1.7 Unless the order specifies an "M" designation, the 
material shall be furnished to inch-pound units. 
1.8 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
