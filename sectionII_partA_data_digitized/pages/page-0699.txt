Arc Welding 
3. General Requirements and Ordering Information 
3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall 
conform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out­
line the testing and retesting methods and procedures, pennis­
sible variations in dimensions and weight, quality and repair of 
defects, marking, loading, and ordering information. 
3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this 
specification, certain supplementary requirements are available 
when additional control, testing, or examination is required to 
meet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the 
listed supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. 
3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of thi.s specification shall prevail. 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 Except for Grade 91, all plates shall be thermally treated 
either by annealing, normalizing and tempering, or, when 
permitted by the purchaser, accelerated cooling from the 
austenitizing temperature by air blasting or liquid quenching, 
followed by tempering. Minimum tempering temperatures 
shall be as follows: 
Grade Temperature, 'F ['CJ 
2, 12, and 11 1150 [620] 
22, 21, and 9 1250 [675] 
5 1300 [705] 
5 .1.1 Grade 91 plates shall be thermally treated, either by 
normalizing and tempering or by accelerated cooling from the 
austenitizing temperature by air blasting or liquid quenching, 
followed by tempering. Grade 91 plates shall be austenitized at 
1900 to 1975°F [1040 to 1080°C] and shall be tempered at 
1350 to 1470°F [730 to 800°C]. 
5.2 Grade 5, 9, 21, 22, and 91 plates ordered without the 
heat treatment required by 5.1 shall be furnished in either the 
stress relieved or the annealed condition. 
5.3 For plates ordered without the heat treatment required 
by 5.I, heat treatment of the plates to conform to 5.1 and to 
Table 2 or Table 3, as applicable, shall be the responsibility of 
the purchaser. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition shown in Table l unless otherwise 
modified in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S 17, 
Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized Steel, in Specification A20/A20M 
for grades other than Grade 11. 
7. Metallurgical Structure 
7.1 Austenitic Grain Size-Grade 2 material shall have a 
coarse austenitic grain size. 
8. Mechanical Requirements 
8.1 Tension Test Requirements: 
8.1.1 The material as represented by the tension test speci­
mens shall confom1 to the applicable requirements of Table 2 
or Table 3, as specified on the order. 
8.1.2 Adjustment of the percentage elongation requirements 
is permitted in accordance with Specification A20/ A20M for 
plates up to¾ in. [20 mm] inclusive, in thickness when an 8-in. 
[200-mm] gage length is used. 
9. Repair Welding 
9.1 Repair welding shall be permitted only with the ap­
proval of the purchaser. Repair welds shall meet the require­
ments of the construction code specified by the purchaser. 
9.2 All repair welds in Grade 91 shall be made with one of 
the following welding • processes and consumables: SMAW, 
A5.5/A5.5M E90XX-B9; SAW, A5.23/A5.23M EB9 + neutral 
flux; GTAW, A5.28/A5.28M ER90S-B9; and FCAW A5.29/ 
A5.29M E91Tl-B9. In addition, the sum of the Ni+Mn content 
of all welding consumables used to weld repair Grade 91 plate 
shall not exceed 1.0 %. 
10. Marking 
10.1 In addition to the marking required in Specification 
A20/A20M, each plate shall be legibly stamped or stenciled, 
depending upon the ordered thickness, with the letter A for 
annealed, N for nonnalized and tempered, and Q for acceler­
ated cooled and tempered, as applicable. Grade 91 plates shall 
be marked with the appropriate type. Plates ordered to, and 
conforming to, Type 2 may be marked Type 1 as well.
