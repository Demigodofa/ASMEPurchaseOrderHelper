Standards Worldwide 
(Identical with ASTM Specification A 666-03) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers austenitic stainless steels 
in the annealed and normally required cold-worked condi­
tions for various structural, architectural, pressure vessel, 
magnetic, cryogenic, and heat-resisting applications. (This 
revision of Specification A 666 replaces prior Specifica­
tions A 412 and A 177.) 
1.2 The application of this specification, or the use of 
material covered by this specification does not automati­
cally allow usage in pressure vessel applications. Only 
annealed conditions of grades specifically approved by the 
ASME code are permitted for pressure vessel use. 
1.3 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be 
regarded as the standard. The values given in parentheses 
are for information only.
