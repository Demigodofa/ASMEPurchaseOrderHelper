3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions: 
3.1.1 The definitions in Test Methods and Definitions A370 
or Test Methods Al058, Test Methods, Practices, and Termi­
nology A751, and Terminology A941 are applicable to this 
specification and to those listed in 1.1. 
3.1.2 heat, n-in secondary melting, all of the ingots re­
melted from a single primary heat. 
3.1.3 imperfection, n-any discontinuity or irregularity 
found in a tube. 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 The steel shall made by any process. 
4.2 The primary melting is permitted to incorporate separate 
degassing or refining and is permitted to be followed by 
secondary melting, such as electroslag remelting or vacuum­
arc remelting. 
4.3 When steel of different grades is sequentially strand 
cast, the resultant transition material shall be removed using an 
established procedure that positively separates the grades. 
5. Ordering Information 
5.1 It is the responsibility of the purchaser to specify all 
requirements that are necessary for product ordered under the 
product specification. Such requirements to be considered 
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
5.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of pieces), 
5.1.2 Name of material (stainless steel tubing), 
5.1.3 Method of manufacture, when applicable (seamless 
(SML), welded (WLD), or heavily cold-worked (HCW)), 
5.1.4 Grade or UNS number, 
5.1.5 Size (outside diameter and average or minimum wall 
thickness), 
1527 
5.1.6 Length (specific or random), 
5 .1. 7 End finish if required, 
5.1.8 Optional requirements, 
5.1.9 Specific type of melting, if required, 
5.1.10 Test report requirements, 
5.1.11 Specification designation and year of issue, and
