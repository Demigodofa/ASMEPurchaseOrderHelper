A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (\") indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers two grades (C and D) of \ncarbon steel plates of structural quality for general application. \n1.2 When the steel is to be welded, a welding procedure \nsuitable for the grade of steel and intended use or service is to \nbe utilized. See Appendix X3 of Specification A6/ A6M for \ninformation on weldability. \n1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units \u00b7are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. \n1.4 For plate produced from coil and furnished without heat \ntreatment or with stress relieving only, the additional \nrequirements, including additional testing requirements and the \nreporting of additional test results, of Specification A6/ A6M \napply. \n1.5 This specification contains notes or footnotes, or both, \nthat provide explanatory material. Such notes and footnotes, \nexcluding those in tables and figures, do not contain any \nmandatory requirements. \n1.6 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.02 on Structural Steel for Bridges, Buildings, Rolling Stock and Ships. \nCurrent edition approved June 1, 2018. Published June 2018. Originally \napproved in 1946. Last previous edition approved in 2013 as A283/A283M - 13. \nDOI: 10.1520/A0283_A0283M-18. \n2 For ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code applications, see related Specifi\u00ad\ncation SA-283/SA 283M in Section II of that Code. \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: 3 \nA6/ A6M Specification for General Requirements for Rolled \nStructural Steel Bars, Plates, Shapes, and Sheet Piling \n3. General Requirements for Delivery \n3.1 Plates furnished under this specification shall con-form \nto the requirements of the current edition of Specification \nA6/A6M, for the specific date ordered, unless a conflict exists, \nin which case this specification shall prevail. \n3.2 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica\u00ad\ntion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates \nproduced from coil means plates that have been cut to \nindividual lengths from a coil. The processor directly controls, \nor is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing \nof a coil into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, \nleveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, \nheat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for \nshipment, and certification. \nNoTE 1-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat \ntreatment or with stress relieving only, two test results are to be reported \nfor each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plate produced \nfrom coil are described in Specification A6/A6M. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 The steel shall be made by one or more of the following \nprocesses: basic-oxygen or electric-furnace. \n4.2 The steel shall be killed. \n3 For referenced ASTM standards, visit the ASTM website, www.astm.org, or \ncontact ASTM Customer Service at service@astm.org.
