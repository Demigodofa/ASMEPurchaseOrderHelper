A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers two grades of electric\u00ad\nresistance-welded steel pipe in NPS 2 to NPS 30 [DN 50 to DN \n750] inclusive, with nominal (average) wall thickness up to \n0.500 in. [12.70 mm], inclusive, and in nominal sizes NPS \n\u00be to NPS 5 [DN 20 to DN 125] inclusive with nominal \n(average) wall thickness 0.083 in. [2.11 mm] to 0.134 in. [3.40 \nmm], depending on size. Pipe having other dimensions (Note \n1) may be furnished provided such pipe complies with all other \nrequirements of this specification. The pipe is intended for \nconveying gas, vapor, water or other liquid; only Grade A is \nadapted for flanging and bending (Note 2). The suitability of \npipe for various purposes is somewhat dependent upon its \ndimensions, properties, and conditions of service, so that the \npurpose for which the pipe is intended should be stated in the \norder. The pipe may be furnished either nonexpanded or cold \nexpanded at the option of the manufacturer. When pipe is cold \nexpanded, the amount of expansion shall not exceed 1.5 % of \nthe outside diameter pipe size. \nNOTE 1-A comprehensive listing of standardized pipe dimensions is \ncontained in ASME B36.lOM. \nNOTE 2-This provision is not intended to prohibit the cold bending of \nGrade B pipe. \n1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n1.3 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n1 This specification is uuder the j\u00b5r:isdiction of ASTM Committee A0l on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.09 on Carbon Steel Tubular Products. \nCurrent edition approved March 1, 2021.
