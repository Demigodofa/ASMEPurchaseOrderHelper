A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A \nsuperscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers precipitation-hardening stain\u00ad\nless steel plate, sheet, and strip. The mechanical properties of \nthese steels are developed by suitable low-temperature heat \ntreatments generally referred to as precipitation hardening. \n1.2 These steels are used for parts requiring corrosion \nresistance and high strength at room temperature or at tem\u00ad\nperatures up to 600 \u00b0F (315 \u00b0C). Some of these steels are \nparticularly suitable for moderate to severe drawing and \nforming in the solution-treated condition. Others are capable of \nmild forming only. They are suitable for machining in the \nsolution-annealed condition, after which they may be hardened \nto the mechanical properties specified in this standard without \ndanger of cracking or distortion. \n1.3 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded \nas the standard. \n1.4 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards:3 \nA480/A480M Specification for General Requirements for \nFlat-Rolled Stainless and Heat-Resisting Steel Plate, \nSheet, and Strip \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of AS'IM Committee A0l on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.17 on Flat-Rolled and Wrought Stainless Steel. \nCurrent edition approved Sept. 1, 2022. Published October 2022. Originally \napproved in 1974. Last previous edition approved in 2022 as A693 - 16 (2022). \nDOI: 10.1520/A0693-22. \n2 For ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code applications see related Specifi\u00ad\ncation SA-693 in Section II of that Code. \n3 For referenced AS'IM standards, visit the AS'IM website, www.astm.org, or \ncontact ASTM Customer Service at service@astm.org.

General Requirements \n3.1 The following requirements for orders for material \nfurnished under this specification shall conform to the appli\u00ad\ncable requirements of the current edition of Specification \nA480/A480M or as specified in the following: \n3.1.1 Ordering Information: \n3.1.1.1 In addition to the requirements of Specification \nA480/A480M, the heat treatment (see Section 6) shall be \nspecified on the purchase order if other than the solution\u00ad\nannealed condition is being ordered. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 The steel shall be melted by one of the following \nprocesses: \n4.1.1 Electric furnace (with separate degassing and refining \noptional), \n4.1.2 Vacuum furnace, and \n4.1.3 One of the former followed by: \n4.1.3.1 Consumable remelting in vacuum, inert gas, or \nelectroslag, or \n4.1.3.2 Electron beam refining. \n4.1.4 Other commercial melting methods as agreed upon \nbetween purchaser and seller are acceptable. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to \nchemical composition specified in Table 1, and shall conform \nto applicable requirements specified in the current edition of \nSpecification A480/ A480M. \n4 Available from Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), 400 Commonwealth \nDr., Warrendale, PA 15096-0001. \n* A Summary of Changes section appears at the end of this standard \n1138 \n-------",
