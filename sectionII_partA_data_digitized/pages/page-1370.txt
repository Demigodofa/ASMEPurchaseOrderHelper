the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or tube may be 
individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat-rolled stock 
or tubes that do not meet the requirements of this specification 
shall be rejected. 
10. Mechanical Requirements 
10.1 Tensile Properties: 
10.1.1 The material shall conform to the tensile properties 
shown in Table 2. 
10.1.2 One tension test shall be made on a specimen for lots 
of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall be made on 
specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 tubes. 
10.1.3 Table 3 gives the computed minimum elongation 
values for each 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] decrease in wall thickness. 
10.2 Hardness: 
10 .2.1 The tubes shall have a hardness number not to exceed 
those prescribed in Table 4. This hardness requirement is not to 
apply to the bend area of U-bend tubes which are not heat 
treated after bending. 
10.2.2 Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests shall be made on 
specimens from two tubes from each lot. 
10.3 Reverse Flattening Test (for Welded Product)-One 
reverse flattening test shall be made on a specimen from each 
1500 ft [460 m] of finished tubing. 
10.4 Flange Test (for Welded Product)-Flange tests shall 
be made on specimens from each end of one finished tube, not 
the one used for the flattening test, from each lot. 
10.5 Flaring Test (for Seamless Tubes)-One test shall be 
made on specimens from one end of one tube from each lot of 
finished tubes. The minimum expansion of the inside diameter 
shall be 10 % . 
10.6 Pressure Test-Each straight tube, or each U-tube after 
completion of the bending and post-bending heat treatment, 
shall be pressure-tested in accordance with one of the follow­
ing paragraphs as specified by the purchaser: 
10.6.1 Hydrostatic Test-Each tube shall be given an inter­
nal hydrostatic test in accordance with Specification Al016/ 
Al016M.

decrease in wall thickness below 5 /,a in. [8 mm]. Table 3 gives the computed 
minimum values.

10.6.2 Pneumatic Test-Each tube shall be examined by a 
pneumatic test (either air underwater or pneumatic leak test) in 
accordance with Specification Al016/A1016M. 
10.7 Lot Definitions: 
10.7.1 For flange and flaring test requirements, the term 
"lot" applies to 125 tube groupings, prior to cutting to length, 
of the same nominal size and wall thickness, produced from the 
same heat of steel and annealed in a continuous furnace. 
10. 7 .2 For tension and hardness requirements, the term "lot" 
applies to all tubes, prior to cutting to length, of the same 
nominal diameter and wall thickness, produced from the same 
heat of steel and annealed in a continuous furnace at the same 
temperature, time at temperature, and furnace speed.
