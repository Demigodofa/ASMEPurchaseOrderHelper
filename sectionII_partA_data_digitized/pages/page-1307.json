Reference Materials \n10.1 For referee analyses, reference standards of a recog\u00ad\nnized standardizing agency shall be employed with preference \ngiven to NIST standard reference materials when applicable. \n(NIST does not produce reference standards suitable for all \nelements or all alloys.) \n10.1.1 When standard reference materials for certain alloys \nare not available from NIST, reference materials may be \nproduced by employing ASTM standard procedures and NIST \nstandard reference materials to the extent that such procedures \nand reference standards are available. Several independent \nlaboratories should be used for certification of these standards \nand their results statistically reviewed and merged. \n10.1.2 Test methods not published by ASTM, such as a \ndefinitive analytical method, may be used when the method is \nvalidated by analyzing certified reference materials along with \nthe candidate reference material. Examples of definitive ana\u00ad\nlytical methods include gravimetric, coulometry, titrimetric \nbased on normality, and mass spectrometry. \n10.2 Working reference materials may be used for routine \nanalytical control. \n11. Significant Numbers \n11.1 Laboratories shall report each element to the same \nnumber of significant numbers as used in the pertinent material \nspecifications. \n1237 ",
