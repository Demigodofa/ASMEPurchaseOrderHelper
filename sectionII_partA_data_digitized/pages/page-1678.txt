111-250 OTHER MARKINGS 
Any other markings, such as marking of non-ASME or 
non-ASTM material specifications, have no relevance, 
even if those markings are for materials explicitly prohib­
ited by the construction code being used. That is, as long 
as the one marking, and the documentation required by 
the material and by the construction code, shows that it 
meets all the requirements for use of that material in that 
construction code, any additional markings are irrelevant.
