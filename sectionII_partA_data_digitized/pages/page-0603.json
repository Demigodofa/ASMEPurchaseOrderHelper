EXPLANATION OF THE USE OF NOTCHED BAR IMPACT TESTS IN DETERMINING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF \nSTEELS FOR LOW-TEMPERATURE SERVICE \nXl. 1 Years of experience and test work have shown that \nsome materials, particularly ferritic steels, change from tough \nto brittle behavior with a decrease in temperature. The transi\u00ad\ntion temperatures and the levels of notch toughness vary with \ndifferent materials, depending on many factors. When materi\u00ad\nals are used under conditions where brittle behavior may occur, \nthere is danger that flaws, which would be considered nonhaz\u00ad\nardous if the material were tough, may propagate to disastrous \nfailure of the equipment. \nXl.2 Accordingly, many varieties of tests have been devel\u00ad\noped in an effort to evaluate the toughness of materials and the \nconditions under which they will transform from tough to \nbrittle behavior. There are many opinions and shadings of \n551 \nopinion as to which test is most suitable for evaluating the \nsuitability of materials for service at low temperatures; how\u00ad\never, as yet, only the Charpy impact test has received sufficient \ngeneral acceptance and has been used as a basis for purchasing \nfor sufficient time to be included in ASTM standards. Further\u00ad\nmore, this test is required for low-temperature service vessels \nand piping constructed in accordance with ASME Code for \nUnfired Pressure Vessels and the American National Standard \nCode for Pressure Piping (ANSI B31), respectively. These \nASTM specifications for materials for low-temperature service \nare primarily used in piping and pressure vessel construction \nthat are subjected to temperatures lower than ambient; conse\u00ad\nquently, the notched bar impact test requirements are written to \nprovide material that in quality and by its testing can be ",
