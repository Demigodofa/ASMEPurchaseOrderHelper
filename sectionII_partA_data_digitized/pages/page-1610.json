Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements specified in \nTable 1 (see Note 2). \nNorn 2-The role of alloying elements in the development of Grade \nC91 has been extensively investigated. V and Cb (Nb) contribute to \nprecipitation strengthening by forming fine and coherent precipitation of \nM(C, N)X carbo-nitrides in the ferrite matrix. V also precipitates as VN \nduring tempering or during creep. The two elements are more effective in \ncombination. Therefore, the addition of strong nitride-forming elements, \nthose with a stronger affinity for nitrogen than Cb (Nb) and V, as \nde-oxidation agents interferes with these high-temperature strengthening \nmechanisms. 6 Grade C933 also requires V and Nb to contribute to \nprecipitation strengthening along with a strong dependence on Boron and \nNitrogen levels. Consequently, the addition of strong nitride-forming \nelements with stronger affinity for nitrogen than Nb, V, and B must also be \navoided. \n7. Mechanical Properties \n7 .1 Tensile Testing: \n7 .1.1 One tension test shall be made from each heat per heat \ntreatment lot. Test results shall conform to the tensile require\u00ad\nments specified in Table 2. \n7 .1.2 If a specimen is machined improperly or if flaws are \nrevealed by machining or during testing, the specimen may be \ndiscarded and another substituted from the same heat. \n7.1.3 Except as permitted by 7.1.4, and except for invest\u00ad\nment castings, test coupons from which tension test specimens \nare prepared shall be removed from heat-treated casting \nprolongations. \n7 .1.4 When agreed upon between the manufacturer and the \npurchaser, test coupons from which test specimens are pre\u00ad\npared shall be cast as separate blocks from the same heat as the \ncasting represented. The test blocks shall be heat treated in the \nsame manner as the casting represented. \n6 Viswanathan, R. and Balcker, W.

Quality \n8.1 All accessible surfaces of the castings shall be examined \nvisually and shall be free of adhering sand, scale, cracks, and \nhot tears. Other surface discontinuities shall meet the visual \nacceptance standards specified in the order. Practice A802/ \nA802M or other visual standards may be used to define \nacceptable surface discontinuities and finish. Unacceptable \nvisual surface discontinuities shall be removed and their \nremoval verified by visual examination of the resultant cavi\u00ad\nties. When methods involving high temperatures are used in \nthe removal of discontinuities, castings shall be preheated to at \nleast 400 \u00b0F [200 \u00b0C]. \n8.2 Except for centrifugally cast pipe, hollow castings larger \nthan NPS 4 [DN 100] and whose internal surfaces are not \naccessible to the visual examination in 8.1 shall be examined \nby the ultrasonic examination prescribed in Supplementary \nRequirement S7 of Specification A703/A703M; or for invest\u00ad\nment castings, Supplementary Requirement S7 of Specification \nA985/ A985M. \n8.2.1 Castings producing a signal equal to or greater than \nthe lowest signal produced by the referenced discontinuities \nshall be considered to contain defects, and they shall be \nidentified and separated from the acceptable castings. The area \nproducing the signal may be re-examined. \n8.2.2 Castings containing defects shall be rejected if the test \nsignals were produced by imperfections that cannot be identi\u00ad\nfied or were produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. \n8.2.3 Castings containing defects may be repaired. To be \naccepted, a repaired casting shall pass the ultrasonic examina\u00ad\ntion and shall meet the minimum wall thickness requirements \nof the purchase order. \n8.3 Each length of centrifugally cast pipe shall be ultrasoni\u00ad\ncally examined in accordance with Specification A999/ \nA999M. \n8.4 When additional inspection is desired, Supplementary \nRequirements S4, S5, S6, and SlO of Specification A703/ \nA703M; or, for investment castings, Specification A985/ \nA985M, may be ordered. \n1556 ",
