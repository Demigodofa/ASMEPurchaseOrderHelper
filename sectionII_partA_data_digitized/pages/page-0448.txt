and tempered forgings for which tests are required at both ends 
by 8.2.2.3 and 8.2.2.4, separately forged test blocks are not 
allowed. 
NoTE 3-In using separately forged test blocks, attention is drawn to the 
effect of mass differences between the production forgings and the test 
blocks. 
8.2 Specific Requirements-The number and location of 
tests are based on forging length, weight, and heat treatment, 
and shall be as prescribed below. The length and weight to be 
used for this purpose shall be the shipped length and weight of 
forgings produced individually or the aggregate shipped length 
and weight of all pieces cut from a multiple forging. 
8.2.1 Annealed, Normalized, or Normalized and Tempered 
Steel Forgings: 
8.2.1.1 For forgings weighing 5000 lb [2250 kg] or less at 
the time of heat treatment, one tension test shall be taken from 
one forging per heat in each heat treatment charge. When heat 
treatment is performed in continuous-type furnaces with suit­
able temperature controls and equipped with recording pyrom­
eters so that complete heat treatment records are available, a 
tempe1ing charge may be considered as any continuous run not 
exceeding an 8 h period. 
8.2.1.2 For forgings weighing over 5000 lb [2250 kg] at the 
time of heat treatment, one tension test shall be taken from 
each forging. , 
8.2.2 Quenched and Tempered Forgings: 
8.2.2.1 For quenched and tempered forgings weighing 
5000 lb [2250 kg] or less at the time of heat treatment, but not 
exceeding 12 ft [3.7 m] in length, one tension test shall be 
taken from one forging per heat in each heat treatment charge. 
When heat treatment is performed in continuous-type furnaces 
with suitable temperature controls and equipped with recording 
pyrometers so that complete heat treatment records are 
available, a tempering charge may be considered as any 
continuous run not exceeding an 8 h period. 
8.2.2.2 For quenched and tempered forgings weighing over 
5000 lb [2250 kg] to 10 000 lb [ 4500 kg] at the time of heat 
treatment, but not exceeding 12 ft [3.7 m] in length, one 
tension test shall be taken from each forging. 
8.2.2.3 For quenched and tempered forgings that exceed 
12 ft [3.7 m] in length, one tension test shall be taken from 
each end of each forging. 
8.2.2.4 For quenched and tempered forgings weighing more 
than 10 000 lb [ 4500 kg] at the time of heat treatment, two 
tension test specimens shall be taken from each forging. These 
shall be offset 180° from each other except that if the length of 
the forging, excluding test prolongations, exceeds 12 ft [3.7 m], 
then one specimen shall be taken from each end of the forging. 
9. Repair Welding 
9.1 Repair welding of forgings is permissible only at the 
option of the purchaser. If repair welding is performed, welders 
and weld procedures shall be qualified in accordance with 
Section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
10. Certification 
10.1 In addition to the mandatory certification requirements 
of Specification A 788/ A 788M, the heat treatment cycle data 
shall be included. 
11. Product Marking 
11.1 Each forging shall be identified in accordance with the 
Marking Section of Specification A 788/ A 788M. In addition, 
the forging shall be marked following the grade designation by 
the letter "A" for annealed, "N" for nmmalized, "NT" for 
normalized and tempered, and "S" for liquid quenched and 
tempered, as applicable. 
12. Keywords

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the 
purchaser in the inquiry, contract, or order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
Sl. Rough Turning and Boring 
S 1.1 The position of the rough turning and boring in the 
sequence of manufacturing operations shall be as specified by 
the purchaser. 
S2. Alternative Tension Test Orientation 
S2.1 In lieu of the requirements of Section 8, the longitu­
dinal axis of the test specimens shall be transverse to the 
direction of major working of the forging. The results shall 
396

the ductility limits that shall be as follows: 
Grade 1 
Elongation in 2 in. [62.5 mm], min,% 20 [18]
