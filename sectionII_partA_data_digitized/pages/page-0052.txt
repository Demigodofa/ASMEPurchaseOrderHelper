CROSS-REFERENCING IN THE ASME BPVC 
Paragraphs within the ASME BPVC may include subparagraph breakdowns, i.e., nested lists. The following is a guide to 
the designation and cross-referencing of subparagraph breakdowns: 
( a) Hierarchy of Subparagraph Breakdowns 
(1) First-level breakdowns are designated as (a), (b), (c), etc. 
(2) Second-level breakdowns are designated as (1), (2), (3), etc. 
(3) Third-level breakdowns are designated as (-a), (-b), (-c), etc. 
(4) Fourth-level breakdowns are designated as (-1), (-2), (-3), etc. 
(SJ Fifth-level breakdowns are designated as ( +a), ( +b), ( +c), etc. 
(6) Sixth-level breakdowns are designated as (+1), (+2), etc. 
(b) Cross-References to Subparagraph Breakdowns. Cross-references within an alphanumerically designated para­
graph ( e.g., PG-1, UIG-56.1, NCD-3223) do not include the alphanumerical designator of that paragraph. The cross­
references to subparagraph breakdowns follow the hierarchy of the designators under which the breakdown appears. 
The following examples show the format: 
(1) If X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.1(c)(1), it will be referenced as (-a). 
(2) if X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.1(c)(2), it will be referenced as (1)(-a). 
(3) If X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.1(e)(1), it will be referenced as (c)(l)(-a). 
(4) If X.1(c)(1)(-a) is referenced in X.2(c)(2), it will be referenced as X.1(c)(1)(-a).
