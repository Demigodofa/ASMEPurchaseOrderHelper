NOTE 1 - Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with either flat anvils having 
a minimum diameter of 0.188 in. or rounded anvils having a minimum radius of curvature of 0.100 in. 
Micrometers with pointed anvils are not suitable for thickness measurement. 
A Measurements for the above table are taken 31s in. from the edge of a strip on 1 in. or wider; and at 
any place on the strip when narrower than 1 in. The given tolerances do not include crown and therefore 
the tolerances for crown as shown in Table 5 are in addition to tolerances in Table 3.
