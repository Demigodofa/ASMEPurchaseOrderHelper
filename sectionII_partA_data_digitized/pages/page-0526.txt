SA-325 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Structural Bolts, Steel, Heat Treated, 120/105 ksi Minimum 
Tensile Strength 
1. Scope 
1. 1 This specification covers two types of quenched and 
tempered steel heavy hex structural bolts having a minimum 
tensile strength of 120 ksi for sizes 1.0 in. and less and 105 ksi 
for sizes over 1.0 to 1 ½ in., inclusive. 
1.2 The bolts are intended for use in structmal connections. 
These connections are covered under the requirements of the 
Specification for Structural Joints Using ASTM A325 or A490 
Bolts, approved by the Research Council on Structural Con­
nections, endorsed by the American Institute of Steel Construc­
tion and by the Industrial Fastener Institute. 
1.3 The bolts are furnished in sizes ½ to 1 ½ in., inclusive. 
They are designated by type, denoting chemical composition as 
follows: 
Type Description 
Type 1 Medium carbon, carbon boron, or medium carbon alloy steel. 
Type 2 Withdrawn in November 1991. 
Type 3 Weathering steel. 
NoTE I-Bolts for general applications, including anchor bolts, are 
covered by Specification A449. Also refer to Specification A449 for 
quenched and tempered steel bolts and studs with diameters greater than 
1 ½ in. but with similar mechanical properties. 
1 .4 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded 
as standard. No other units of measmement are included in this 
standard. 
NoTE 2-A complete metric companion to Specification A325 has been 
developed, Specification A325M; therefore, no metric equivalents are 
presented in this specification. 
1.5 This specification is applicable to heavy hex structmal 
bolts only. For bolts of other configurations and thread lengths 
with similar mechanical properties, see Specification A449. 
1.6 Terms used in this specification are defined in Termi­
nology Fl 789. 
1.7 The following safety hazard caveat pertains only to the 
test methods portion, Section 10, of this specification:This 
standard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, 
if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user 
of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health 
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limita­
tions prior to use.
