FIG. S1 .1 Eddy-Current Test Standard 
S1.6 Tubes may be reconditioned and retested provided 
reconditioning does not adversely effect the minimum wall 
thickness or other properties of the tube specification require­
ments. Upon agreement between purchaser and manufacturer, 
the referee method, employing ultrasonic testing, may be 
employed for retesting tubes rejected by the eddy-current test. 
The calibration standard for this test shall be identical to that 
required for the eddy-current test. 
S2. Nondestructive Eddy-Current Testing (Select Com­
mercial Grade) 
S2.1 The manufacturer shall test the tubing using the 
procedure outlined in Supplementary Requirement Sl, except 
for the notch standards, which shall be as indicated in Table 
S2.1.

is greater. Refer to Fig. S1 .1 for notch location orientation and length of calibration 
standard. 
S3. Report 
S3.1 A report shall be furnished by the manufacturer to 
include a record of all tests performed to qualify material to 
this specification. This record shall include numbers of tests 
performed and qualitative or quantitative results as is appli­
cable. 
S4. Intergranular Corrosion Tests 
S4.1 When specified, material shall pass intergranular cor­
rosion tests conducted by the manufacturer in accordance with 
Practices A262, Practice E. 
NOIB S4.1-Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condition for 
low carbon grades, and on the as-shipped condition for other grades.
