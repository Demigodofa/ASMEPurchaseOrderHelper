0.0001 in. (0.0025 mm) with an accuracy of 0.0001 in. in any 
0.001-in. (0.025 mm) range. The preferred method of measur­
ing the length shall be between conical centers machined on the 
center line of the bolt, with mating centers on the measuring 
anvils. The head or body of the bolt shall be marked so that it 
can be placed in the same position for all measurements. The 
bolt shall be assembled in the testing equipment as outlined in 
A3.2.1.4, and the proof load specified in the product specifi­
cation shall be applied. Upon release of this load the length of 
the bolt shall be again measured and shall show no permanent 
elongation. A tolerance of :t0.0005 in. (0.0127 mm) shall be 
allowed between the measurement made before loading and 
that made after loading. Variables, such as straightness and 
thread alignment (plus measurement e1rnr), may result in 
apparent elongation of the fasteners when the proof load is 
initially applied. In such cases, the fastener may be retested 
using a 3 % greater load, and may be considered satisfactory if 
the length after this loading is the same as before this loading 
(within the 0.0005-in. tolerance for measurement error). 
A3.2. l .3 Proof Load-Time of Loading-The proof load is to 
be maintained for a period of 10 s before release of load, when 
using Method 1. 
(1) Method 2, Yield Strength-The bolt shall be assembled 
in the testing equipment as outlined in A3.2.l.4. As the load is 
applied, tl1e total elongation of the bolt or any part of the bolt 
which includes the exposed six threads shall be measured and 
recorded to produce a load-strain or a stress-strain diagram. 
The load or stress at an offset equal to 0.2 % of the length of 
bolt occupied by six full threads shall be determined by the 
method described in 14.2.1 of these methods, A370. This load 
or stress shall not be less than that prescribed in the product 
specification. 
A3.2.l.4 Axial Tension Testing of Full Size Bolts-Bolts 
are to be tested in a holder with the load axially applied 
between the head and a nut or suitable fixture (see Fig. A3.l), 
either of which shall have sufficient thread engagement to 
FIG. A3.1 Tension Testing Full-size Bolt 
develop the full strength of the bolt. The nut or fixture shall be 
assembled on the bolt leaving six complete bolt threads 
unengaged between the grips, except for heavy hexagon 
structural bolts which shall have four complete threads unen­
gaged between the grips. To meet the requirements of this test, 
there shall be a tensile failure in the body or threaded section 
with no failure at the junction of the body and head. When 
tensile testing externally threaded fasteners made of austenitic 
stainless steel and the test fastener's thread pulls out of the 
internally threaded test fixture after the minimum tensile 
strength requirement has been reached, the fasteners shall be 
considered conforming to the tensile strength requirement and, 
in addition to the tensile strength, the failure mode shall be 
reported to the purchaser. If it is necessary to record or report 
the tensile strength of bolts as psi values, the stress area shall 
be calculated from the mean of the mean root and pitch 
diameters of Class 3 external threads as follows: 
A,= 0.7854 [D - (0.9743/n)] 2 (A3.l) 
where: 
As = stress area, in.2, 
D = nominal diameter, in., and 
n = number of threads per in. 
A3.2.l.5 Tension Testing of Full-size Bolts with a Wedge­
The purpose of this test is to obtain the tensile strength and 
demonstrate the "head quality" and ductility of a bolt with a 
standard head by subjecting it to eccentric loading. The 
ultimate load on the bolt shall be determined as described in 
A3.2.1.4, except that a 10° wedge shall be placed under the 
same bolt previously tested for the proof load (see A3.2.1.1). 
The bolt head shall be so placed that no comer of the hexagon 
or square takes a bearing load, that is, a flat of the head shall 
be aligned with the direction of uniform thickness of the wedge 
(see Fig. A3.2). The wedge shall have an included angle 
between its faces as shown in Table A3.1 and shall have a 
thickness of one-half of the nominal bolt diameter at the short 
side of the hole. The hole in the wedge shall have the following 
clearance over the nominal size of the bolt, and its edges, top 
and bottom, shall be rounded to the following radius: 
Clearance in Hole, Radius on Corners of 
Nominal Bolt Size, in. in. (mm) Hole, in. (mm) 
¼ to ½ 0.030 (0.76) 0.030 (0.76) 
9 /,a to ¾ 0.050 (1.3) 0.060 (1.5) 
7 /s to 1 0.063 (1.5) 0.060 (1.5)

11/s to 1¼ 0.063 (1.5) 0.125 (3.2) 
13/s to 1½ 0.094 (2.4) 0.125 (3.2) 
A3.2.1.6 Wedge Testing of HT Bolts Threaded to Head-For 
heat-treated bolts that are threaded 1 diameter and closer to the 
underside of the head, the wedge angle shall be 6° for sizes ¼ 
through¾ in. (6.35 to 19.0 mm) and 4° for sizes over¾ in. 
A3.2.1.7 Tension Testing of Bolts Machined to Round Test 
Specimens: 
( 1) Bolts under l ½ in. (38 mm) in nominal diameter 
which require machined tests shall preferably use a standard 
½-in., (13 mm) round 2-in. (50 mm) gauge length test 
specimen (see Fig. 4); however, bolts of small cross-section 
that will not permit the taking of this standard test specimen 
shall use one of the small-size-specimens-proportional-to­
standard (see Fig. 4) and the specimen shall have a reduced 
section as large as possible. In all cases, the longitudinal axis of
