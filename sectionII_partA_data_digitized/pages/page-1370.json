Lengths of flat-rolled stock \nor tubes that do not meet the requirements of this specification \nshall be rejected. \n10. Mechanical Requirements \n10.1 Tensile Properties: \n10.1.1 The material shall conform to the tensile properties \nshown in Table 2. \n10.1.2 One tension test shall be made on a specimen for lots \nof not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall be made on \nspecimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 tubes. \n10.1.3 Table 3 gives the computed minimum elongation \nvalues for each 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] decrease in wall thickness. \n10.2 Hardness: \n10 .2.1 The tubes shall have a hardness number not to exceed \nthose prescribed in Table 4. This hardness requirement is not to \napply to the bend area of U-bend tubes which are not heat \ntreated after bending. \n10.2.2 Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests shall be made on \nspecimens from two tubes from each lot. \n10.3 Reverse Flattening Test (for Welded Product)-One \nreverse flattening test shall be made on a specimen from each \n1500 ft [460 m] of finished tubing. \n10.4 Flange Test (for Welded Product)-Flange tests shall \nbe made on specimens from each end of one finished tube, not \nthe one used for the flattening test, from each lot. \n10.5 Flaring Test (for Seamless Tubes)-One test shall be \nmade on specimens from one end of one tube from each lot of \nfinished tubes. The minimum expansion of the inside diameter \nshall be 10 % . \n10.6 Pressure Test-Each straight tube, or each U-tube after \ncompletion of the bending and post-bending heat treatment, \nshall be pressure-tested in accordance with one of the follow\u00ad\ning paragraphs as specified by the purchaser: \n10.6.1 Hydrostatic Test-Each tube shall be given an inter\u00ad\nnal hydrostatic test in accordance with Specification Al016/ \nAl016M. \nTABLE 2 Tensile Requirements \nTensile Strength, Yield Strength, \nElongationA \nGrade in 2 in. \nmin, ksi [MPa] min, ksi [MPa] or50 mm, \nmin,% \nTP409 55 [380) 30 [205) 20 \nTP439 60 [415) 30 [205) 20 \nTPXM-27 65 [450) 40 [275] 20 \nTP XM-33 68 [470) 45 [310] 20 \n25-4-4 90 [620] 75 [515] 20 \n26-3-3 85 [585] 65 [450] 20 \n29-4 80 [550] 60 [415] 20 \n29-4-2 80 [550] 60 [415] 20 \n18-2 60 [415] 35 [240] 20 \n29-4C 75 [515] 60 [415] 18 \nA For longitudinal strip tests, a deduction of 0.90 % for 29-4C and 1 % for all other \ngrades shall be made from the basic minimum elongation for each 1/s2 in.
