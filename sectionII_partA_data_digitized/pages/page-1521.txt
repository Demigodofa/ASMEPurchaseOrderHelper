ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-988/SA-988M 
S7. Ultrasonic Testing 
S7.1 Austenitic-Ferritic stainless steel parts made of S32505 
shall be 100 % ultrasonic tested with straight and angle beam 
probes in accordance with Practice A745/A745M. Acceptance 
limits shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
S8. Repair Welding 
S8.1 No repair welding shall be permitted without prior 
approval of the purchaser. If permitted, the restrictions of 
Section 14 shall apply. 
S9. Heat Treatment Details 
S9.1 The manufacturer shall furnish a detailed test report 
containing the information required in 17 .1 and shall include 
all pertinent details of the heat treating cycle given the parts. 
S10. Material for Optimum Resistance to Stress-Corrosion 
Cracking 
SlO.l Austenitic stainless steel parts shall be furnished in 
the solution-annealed condition as a final operation with no 
subsequent cold working permitted unless specifically permit­
ted by the purchaser. 
Sll. Intergranular Corrosion Tests 
Sll.1 Intergranular corrosion tests shall be performed on 
specimens of austenitic stainless steel in accordance with 
Practices A262. 
Sll.2 For the austenitic stainless steels, details concerning 
the number of specimens and their source and location are to be 
a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
S12. Pitting and Crevice Corrosion Test 
Sl2.1 The stainless steels in the final heat treated condition 
shall be tested in accordance with Test Method G4S. Test 
procedures and acceptance criteria shall be a matter of agree­
ment between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
S13. Detrimental Intermetallic Phase Test 
Sl3.l The austenitic-ferritic stainless steels shall be tested 
in accordance with the test methods given in Test Methods 
A923. Acceptance criteria, if not specified in Test Methods 
A923, shall be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer 
and the purchaser. 
S14. Special Filler Metal 
S14.1 In repair welded S31600, S31603, S31609, and 
S31651 parts, the deposited weld metal shall conform to E 308 
composition wire. Parts repair welded with E 308 weld metal 
shall be marked S_W308. 
SIS. Hardness Test 
S 15 .1 Each part shall be hardness tested and shall meet the 
requirements of Table 3. 
S16. Heat Treatment of Austenitic Stainless Parts 
S 16.1 The purchaser shall specify the heat treatment method 
in 7 .1 that shall be employed. 
S16.2 The manufacturer shall provide a test report contain­
ing the information required in 17 .1 and shall include a 
statement of the heat treatment method employed. 
S17. Grain Size for Austenitic Stainless Steels 
S 17 .1 Hot isostatically-pressed parts made from austenitic 
stainless steel grades other than H grades shall be tested for 
average grain size by Test Methods El12. Details of the test 
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
S18. Fatigue Acceptance Test 
S 18 .1 For austenitic stainless steel components intended for 
service above 1000 °F [540 °C], a uniaxial fatigue test shall be 
performed. 
Sl8.2 The fatigue test shall be performed in air at 1100 °F 
[595 °C] at an axial strain range of 1.0 % with a one hour hold 
period at the maximum positive strain point in each cycle. Test 
specimen location and orientation shall be as specified in 
Specification A961/A961M and the applicable product speci­
fications. Testing shall be conducted in accord with Practice 
E606/E606M. The test shall exceed 200 cycles without fracture 
or a 20 % drop in the load range. 
S18.3 Failure to meet this requirement shall be cause for 
rejection of all parts from that blend. 
S18.4 Test frequency shall be the same as for tension tests 
(See 9.5). Retesting is permitted. For a retest, two additional 
specimens produced from the same blend shall be tested and 
both specimens must pass the cyclic life requirement. Further 
retests are not permitted. 
S19. Powder Size 
S19.l The maximum allowable powder size is 0.020 in. [0.5 
mm], and the powder shall be produced by the gas atomization 
process. 
S20. Powder Shielding 
S20. l Immediately following atomization, the powder shall 
remain shielded by an inert gas until the powder is below a 
temperature of 105 °F [ 40 °C] to ensure that the detrimental 
absorption of oxygen and other deleterious contaminants is no 
longer possible. Powder should be protected during storage to 
prevent the detrimental pick-up of oxygen and other 
contaminants. 
S21. Chemical Analysis 
S21.1 The chemical composition of a sample from one part 
from each lot of parts shall be determined by the manufacturer. 
The composition of the sample shall conform to the chemical 
requirements prescribed in Table 1. 
S22. Manufacturer's Certification 
S22.1 A manufacturer's certification shall be furnished to 
the purchaser stating that material has been manufactured, 
tested, and inspected in accordance with this specification, and 
that the test results on representative samples meet specifica­
tion requirements. A report of the test results shall be furnished.
