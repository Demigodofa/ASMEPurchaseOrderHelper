Heat Treatment 6 \n7 .1 After hot working, forgings shall be cooled to a tem\u00ad\nperature below 1000 \u00b0F [538 \u00b0C] prior to heat treating in \naccordance with the requirements of Table 1. \n7.2 \u00a3ow Alloy Steels and Ferritic and Martensitic Stainless \nSteels-The low alloy steels and ferritic and martensitic \nstainless steels shall be heat treated in accordance with the \nrequirements of 7 .1 and Table 1. When more than one heat \ntreatment option is listed for a Grade in Table 1, any one of the \nheat treatments listed shall be performed. The selection of the \nheat treatment shall be at the manufacturer's option, unless \notherwise stated in the purchase order. \n7.2.1 Liquid Quenching-Except as permitted in 7.2.2, for \nF 1, F 2, and F 3, and when agreed to by the purchaser, liquid \nquenching followed by tempering shall be permitted provided \nthe temperatures in Table 1 for each grade are used. \n7.2.1.1 Marking-Parts that are liquid quenched and tem\u00ad\npered shall be marked \"QT.\" \n7.2.2 Alternatively, Grade F 1, F 2, and F 12, Classes 1 and \n2 may be given a heat treatment of 1200 \u00b0F [650 \u00b0C] minimum \nafter final hot or cold forming. \n7.3 Austenitic and Ferritic-Austenitic Stainless Steels\u00ad\nExcept as permitted by 7 .5, the austenitic and ferritic-austenitic \nstainless steels shall be heat treated and liquid-quenched in \naccordance with the requirements of 7 .1 and Table 1. \n7.3.1 Alternatively, immediately following hot working, \nwhile the temperature of the forging is not less than the \nminimum solution annealing temperature specified in Table 1, \nforgings made from austenitic grades (except grades F 304H, F \n309H, F 310, F 310H, F 316H, F 316Ti, F 321, F 321H, F 347, \nF 347H, F 348, F 348H, F 45, F35030, and F 56) may be \nindividually rapidly quenched in accordance with the require\u00ad\nments of Table 1. Ferritic-austenitic grades may be solution \nannealed without cooling below 1000 \u00b0F by being re-heated to \nthe solution annealing temperature required in Table 1, held for \na time sufficient to dissolve phases and precipitates which may \ncause a reduction in corrosion or mechanical properties, and \nquenched in accordance with Table 1. \n7.3.2 See Supplementary Requirement S8 if a particular \nheat treatment method is to be employed. \n7.4 Time of Heat Treatment-Heat treatment of forgings \nmay be performed before machining. \n7.5 Forged or Rolled Bar-Forged or rolled austenitic \nstainless bar from which cylindrically shaped parts are to be \nmachined, as permitted by 6.4, and the parts machined from \nsuch bar, without heat treatment after machining, shall be \nfurnished to the annealing and quenching or rapid-cooling \n6 A solution annealing temperature above 1950 \u00b0F [1065 \u00b0C] may impair the \nresistance to intergranular corrosion after subsequent exposure to sensitizing \nconditions in F 321, F 321H, F 347, F 347H, F 348, and F 348H. When specified \nby the purchaser, a lower temperature stabilizing treatment or a second solution \nannealing shall be used subsequent to the initial high temperature solution anneal \n(see Supplementary Requirement S10). \nrequirements of Specification A484/A484M or this \nspecification, with subsequent light cold drawing and straight\u00ad\nening permitted (see Supplementary Requirement S3 if anneal\u00ad\ning must be the final operation). \n7.6 Hollow Bar-Austenitic stainless hollow bar from \nwhich cylindrically shaped parts are to b~ machined, as \npermitted by 6.4, and the parts machined from such hollow bar, \nwithout heat treatment after machining, shall be furnished to \nthe annealing and quenching or rapid-cooling requirements of \nSpecification A511/ A511M, or this specification, with subse\u00ad\nquent light cold drawing and straightening permitted (see \nSupplementary Requirement S3 if annealing must be the final \noperation). \n8. Chemical Composition \n8.1 A chemical heat analysis in accordance with Specifica\u00ad\ntion A961/A961M shall be made and conform to the chemical \ncomposition prescribed in Table 2. \n8.2 Grades to which lead, selenium, or other elements are \nadded for the purpose of rendering the material free-machining \nshall not be used. \n8 .3 Starting material produced to a specification that spe\u00ad\ncifically requires the. addition of any element beyond those \nlisted in Table 2 for the applicable grade of material is not \nperrni tted. \n8.4 Steel grades covered in this specification shall not \ncontain an unspecified element, other than nitrogen in stainless \nsteels, for the ordered grade to the extent that the steel \nconforms to the requirements of another grade for which that \nelement is a specified element having a required minimum \ncontent. For this requirement, a grade is defined as an alloy \ndescribed individually and identified by its own UNS designa\u00ad\ntion or Grade designation and identification symbol in Table 2. \n8.5 Product Analysis-The purchaser may make a product \nanalysis on products supplied to this specification in accor\u00ad\ndance with Specification A961/A961M. \n9. Mechanical Properties \n9.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to \nmechanical properties for the grade ordered as listed in Table 3. \n9.2 Mechanical test specimens shall be obtained from pro\u00ad\nduction forgings, or from separately forged test blanks pre\u00ad\npared from the stock used to make the finished product. In \neithet case, mechanical test specimens shall not be removed \nuntil after all heat treatment is complete. If repair welding is \nrequired, test specimens shall not be removed until after \npost-weld heat treatment is complete, except for ferritic grades \nwhen the post-weld heat treatment is conducted at least 50 \u00b0F \n[30 \u00b0C] below the actual tempering temperature. When test \nblanks are used, they shall receive approximately the same \nworking as the finished product. The test blanks shall be heat \ntreated with the finished product and shall approximate the \nmaximum cross section of the forgings they represent. \n9.3 For normalized and tempered, or quenched and tem\u00ad\npered forgings, the central axis of the test specimen shall be \ntaken at least \u00bc T from the nearest surface as-heat-treated, \n214 ",
