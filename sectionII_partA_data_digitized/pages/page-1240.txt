[30 °C] below nor more than 175 °F [100 °C] above the 
furnace set point used. 
4.2.2.2 The maximum variation in measured temperature as 
determined by the difference between the highest temperature 
and the lowest temperature shall be as agreed between the 
purchaser and producer, except that during production heat 
treatment no portion of the furnace shall be below the 
minimum specified temperature nor above the maximum 
specified temperature for the grade being processed. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 Chemical Analysis-Chemical analysis of materials 
covered by this specification shall be in accordance with Test 
Methods A751. 
5.2 Heat Analysis-An analysis of each heat shall be made 
by the manufacturer to determine the percentages of the 
elements specified. The analysis shall be made from a test 
sample preferably taken during the pouring of the heat. When 
drillings are used, they shall be taken not less than ¼ in. 
[6.4 mm] beneath the surface. The chemical composition thus 
determined shall be reported to the purchaser, or their 
representative, and shall conform to the requirements in the 
individual specification for the grade being poured. 
5.3 Product Analysis-A product analysis may be made by 
the purchaser from material representing each heat, lot, or 
casting. The analysis shall be made on representative material. 
Due to the possibility of decarburization, samples for carbon 
analysis shall be taken no closer than ¼ in. [6.4 mm] to a cast 
surface, except that castings too thin for this shall be analyzed 
on representative material. The chemical composition thus 
determined shall meet the requirements specified in the appli­
cable specification for the grade involved, or shall be subject to 
rejection by the purchaser, except that the chemical composi­
tion determined for carbon and low-alloy steel and stainless 
steel castings may vary from the specified limits by the 
amounts shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The 
product analysis tolerances of Tables 1 and 2 are not applicable 
as acceptance criteria for heat analysis by the casting manu­
facturer. When comparing product and heat analysis for other 
thari carbon and low-alloy steels and stainless steels, the 
reproducibility data R 2 , in Test Methods E353 or E354, as 
applicable, shall be taken into consideration .. 
5.4 Unspecified Elements-When chemical analysis for el­
ements not specified for the grade ordered is desired, Supple­
mentary Requirement S 1 may be specified. 
5.5 Grade Substitution-Grade substitution is not permitted. 
Grade substitution occurs when the material being supplied 
contains one or more elements that are not specified for the 
supplied material such that the material conforms to the 
requirements of a different grade. 
5.6 Where more than one ladle is poured into a single 
casting, the molten metal in each ladle must conform to the 
specified chemical requirements. 
6. Mechanical Test Methods 
6.1 All mechanical tests shall be conducted in accordance 
with Test Methods and Definitions A370. When material is

A The range denotes the composition limits up to which the tolerances are 
computed by the equation, and above which the tolerances are given by a 
constant. 
8 The subscript L for the elements In each equation indicates that the limits of the 
element specified by the applicable specification are to be inserted into the 
equation to calculate the tolerance for the upper limlt and the lower limit, if 
applicable, respectively. Examples of computing tolerances are presented In the 
footnote C. 
0 To compute the tolerances, consider the manganese limits 0.50 - 80 % of Grade 
WC4 of Specification A217/A217M. In accordance with Table 1, the maximum 
permissible deviation of a product analysis below the lower limit 0.50 is 0.05 % = 
(0.08 x 0.50 + 0.01 ). The lowest acceptable product analysis of Grade WC4, 
therefore, is 0.45 %. Similarly, the maximum permissible deviation above the 
upper limit of 0.80 % is 0.074 % = (0.08 x 0.80 + 0.01). The highest acceptable 
product analysis of Grade WC4, therefore, is 0.874. For Grade wee of Specifi­
cation A216/A216M, the maximum manganese content is 1.40 % if the carbon 
content is 0.20 %. In this case, the highest acceptable product analysis is 1.49 = 
(1.40 + 0.09). 
ordered to an M-suffix (SI units) standard, then in accordance 
with Test Methods A1058. 
6.2 Choice of testing track from the options listed in Test 
Methods Al058 when material is ordered to an M-su:ffix (SI 
units) product standard, should be identified by the purchaser 
in the ordering information. If the choice of test track is not 
specified in the. order, then the default ASTM tr.ack shall be 
used as noted in Test Methods A1058. 
7. Tensile Requirements 
7 .1 One tension test shall be made from each heat, and shall 
conform to the tensile requirements specified. Test coupons 
shall be cast from the same heat as the castings represented, 
except that for investment castings, the test coupons shall be 
cast in the same type of mold as the castings.
