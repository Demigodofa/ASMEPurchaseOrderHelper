When the longer dimension is from 900 to 1800 mm, inclusive, the permissible flatness variation shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount \nfor the specified width, but in no case less than 6 mm. \nNorn 4--The variations given in this table apply to plates that have a minimum specified tensile strength not over 415 MPa or comparable chemistry \nor hardness. For plates specified to a higher minimum tensile strength or comparable chemistry or hardness, the permissible variations are 1 \u00bd times the \namounts shown in the table below. \nNorn 5-This table and these notes cover the flatness variations of circular and sketch plates based on the maximum dimensions of those plates. \nNom 6-Waviness tolerances for rectangular plates, universal mill plates, and circular and sketch plates do not apply. \nNorn 7-A \"Z\" indicates that there is no published restricted value for the size. \nNorn 8-Plates shall be in horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured. \nSpecified \nThickness, mm \nTo 6, excl \n6 to 10, excl \n10 to 12, excl \n12 to 20, excl \n20 to 25, excl \n25 to 50, excl \n1200 to 1500, excl \n18 \n15 \n8 \n7 \n7 \n7 \nPermissible Variations from a Flat Surface for Specified Widths, mm \n1500 to 1800, excl 1800 to 2100, excl 2100 to 2400, excl 2400 to 2700, excl \n24 Z Z Z \n18 22 24 27 \n8 10 11 13 \n8 8 10 13 \n8 8 8 10 \n7 7 8 8 \n2700 to 3000, incl \nz \n29 \n15 \n13 \n11 \n8 \nTABLE S27.3 Permissible Variations from Flatness for High-Strength Low-Alloy Steel Plates As-Rolled or Normalized Ordered to \nRestrictive Flatness \nNorn I-Flatness Variations for Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and variation in flatness along the length shall not \nexceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 12 ft in length, or in any 12 ft of longer plates. \nNorn 2-Flatness Variations for Width-The flatness variation across the width shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width. \nNorn 3-When the longer dimension is under 36 in., the variation in flatness along the length and across the width shall not exceed 3 /s in. in each \ndirection.
