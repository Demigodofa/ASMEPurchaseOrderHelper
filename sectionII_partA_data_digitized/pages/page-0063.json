For SMAW, low hydrogen \nelectrodes shall be used. \n9.5.1.3 Electrodes and electrode-flux combinations shall be \nselected so that the tensile strength of the deposited weld metal \n(after any required heat treatment) is consistent with the tensile \nstrength specified for the base metal being repaired. \n9.5.1.4 Welding electrodes and flux materials shall be dry \nand protected from moisture during storage and use. \n9.5.1.5 Prior to repair welding, the surface to be welded \nshall be inspected to verify that the imperfections intended to \nbe removed have been removed completely. Surfaces to be \nwelded and smiaces adjacent to the weld shall be dry and free \nof scale, slag, mst, moisture, grease, and other foreign material \nthat would prevent proper welding. \n9.5.1.6 Welders and welding operators shall be qualified in \naccordance with the requirements of AWS Dl.1/Dl.lM or \nASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX, except \nthat any complete joint penetration groove weld qualification \nalso qualifies the welder or welding operator to do repair \nwelding. \n9.5.1.7 Repair welding of structural products shall be in \naccordance with a welding procedure specification (WPS) that \nis in accordance with the requirements of AWS Dl.1/Dl.lM or \nASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX, with the \nfollowing exceptions or clarifications: \n( 1) The WPS shall be qualified by testing a complete joint \npenetration groove weld or a surface groove weld. \n(2) The geometry of the surface groove weld need not be \ndescribed in other than a general way. \n(3) An AWS Dl.1/Dl.lM prequalified complete joint \npenetration groove weld WPS is acceptable. \n( 4) Any material not listed in the prequalified base \nmetal-filler metal combinations of AWS Dl.1/Dl.lM also is \nconsidered to be prequalified if its chemical composition and \nmechanical properties are comparable to those for one of the \nprequalified base metals listed in AWS Dl.1/Dl.lM. \n9.5.1.8 When so specified in the purchase order, the WPS \nshall include qualification by Charpy V-notch testing, with the \ntest locations, test conditions, and the acceptance criteria \nmeeting the requirements specified for repair welding in the \npurchase order. \n9.5.1.9 When so specified in the purchase order, the welding \nprocedure specification shall be subject to approval by the \npurchaser prior to repair welding. \n9.5.2 Structural Products with a Specified Minimum Tensile \nStrength of 100 ksi [690 MPa] or Higher-Repair welding of \nstructural products with a specified minimum tensile strength \nof 100 ksi [690 MPa] or higher shall be subject to the following \nadditional requirements: \n9.5.2.1 When so specified in the purchase order, prior \napproval for repair by welding shall be obtained from the \npurchaser. \n9.5.2.2 The surface to be welded shall be inspected using a \nmagnetic particle method or a liquid penetrant method to verify \nthat the imperfections intended to be removed have been \ncompletely removed. When magnetic particle inspection is \n11 \nemployed, the surface shall be inspected both parallel and \nperpendicular to the length of the area to be repaired. \n9.5.2.3 When weld repairs are to be post-weld heat-treated, \nspecial care shall be exercised in the selection of electrodes to \navoid those compositions that embrittle as a result of such heat \ntreatment. \n9.5.2.4 Repairs on structural products that are subsequently \nheat-treated at the mill shall be inspected after heat treatment; \nrepairs on structural products that are not subsequently heat\u00ad\ntreated at the mill shall be inspected no sooner than 48 h after \nwelding. Such inspection shall use a magnetic particle method \nor a liquid penetrant method; where magnetic particle inspec\u00ad\ntion is involved, such inspection shall be both parallel to and \nperpendicular to the length of the repair. \n9.5.2.5 The location of the weld repairs shall be marked on \nthe finished piece. \u2022 \n9.5.3 Repair Quality-The welds and adjacent heat-affected \nzone shall be sound and free of cracks, the weld metal being \nthoroughly fused to all surfaces and edges without undercutting \nor overlap. Any visible cracks, porosity, lack of fusion, or \nundercut in any layer shall be removed prior to deposition of \nthe succeeding layer. Weld metal shall project at least 1/J6 in. (2 \nmm) above the rolled surface after welding, and the projecting \nmetal shall be removed by chipping or grinding, or both, to \nmake it flush with the rolled smiace, and to produce a \nworkmanlike finish. \n9.5.4 Inspection of Repair-The manufacturer or processor \nshall maintain an inspection program to inspect the work to see \nthat: \n9.5.4.1 Imperfections have been completely removed. \n9.5.4.2 The limitations specified above have not been ex\u00ad\nceeded. \n9.5.4.3 Established welding procedures have been followed, \nand \n9.5.4.4 Any weld deposit is of acceptable quality as defined \nabove. \n10. Test Methods \n10.1 All tests shall be conducted in accordance with Test \nMethods and Definitions A370. \n10.2 Yield strength shall be determined either by the 0.2 % \noffset method or by the 0.5 % extension under load method, \nunless otherwise stated in the material specification. \n10.3 Rounding Procedures-For purposes of determining \nconformance with the specification, a calculated value shall be \nrounded to the nearest 1 ksi [5 MPa] tensile and yield strength, \nand to the nearest unit in the right-hand place of figures used in \nexpressing the limiting value for other values in accordance \nwith the rounding method given in Practice E29. \n10.4 For full-section test specimens of angles, the cross\u00ad\nsectional area used for calculating the yield and tensile \nstrengths shall be a theoretical area calculated on the basis of \nthe weight of the test specimen (see 12.1). \n11. Tension Tests \n11.1 Condition-Test specimens for non-heat-treated struc\u00ad\ntural products shall be taken from test coupons that are \nrepresentative of the structural products in their delivered ",
