Scope \n1. 1 This specification covers two types of quenched and \ntempered steel heavy hex structural bolts having a minimum \ntensile strength of 120 ksi for sizes 1.0 in. and less and 105 ksi \nfor sizes over 1.0 to 1 \u00bd in., inclusive. \n1.2 The bolts are intended for use in structmal connections. \nThese connections are covered under the requirements of the \nSpecification for Structural Joints Using ASTM A325 or A490 \nBolts, approved by the Research Council on Structural Con\u00ad\nnections, endorsed by the American Institute of Steel Construc\u00ad\ntion and by the Industrial Fastener Institute. \n1.3 The bolts are furnished in sizes \u00bd to 1 \u00bd in., inclusive. \nThey are designated by type, denoting chemical composition as \nfollows: \nType Description \nType 1 Medium carbon, carbon boron, or medium carbon alloy steel. \nType 2 Withdrawn in November 1991. \nType 3 Weathering steel. \nNoTE I-Bolts for general applications, including anchor bolts, are \ncovered by Specification A449. Also refer to Specification A449 for \nquenched and tempered steel bolts and studs with diameters greater than \n1 \u00bd in. but with similar mechanical properties. \n1 .4 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded \nas standard. No other units of measmement are included in this \nstandard. \nNoTE 2-A complete metric companion to Specification A325 has been \ndeveloped, Specification A325M; therefore, no metric equivalents are \npresented in this specification. \n1.5 This specification is applicable to heavy hex structmal \nbolts only. For bolts of other configurations and thread lengths \nwith similar mechanical properties, see Specification A449. \n1.6 Terms used in this specification are defined in Termi\u00ad\nnology Fl 789. \n1.7 The following safety hazard caveat pertains only to the \ntest methods portion, Section 10, of this specification:This \nstandard does not purport to address all of the safety concerns, \nif any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user \nof this standard to establish appropriate safety and health \npractices and determine the applicability of regulatory limita\u00ad\ntions prior to use. \n2.
