Mechanical testing must be performed subsequent to \nthe final heat-treating operation. \n8.5 Liquid quenching followed by tempering shall be per\u00ad\nmitted for all grades when approved by the purchaser. Mini\u00ad\nmum tempering temperature shall be 1100 \u00b0F [595 \u00b0C] for \nWPB, WPC, and WPR, 1150 \u00b0F [620 \u00b0C] for Grades WPl Type \n1 and Type 2, WPll Class 1, WPll Class 2, WP 12 Class 1, \nand WP12 Class 2 and 1250 \u00b0F [675 \u00b0C] for Grades WPS, \nWP9, WP22 Class 1, 1350 \u00b0F [730 \u00b0C] for both Grade WP91 \nType 1 and Type 2 and WP911 and 1380 \u00b0F [750 \u00b0C] for Grade \nWP115. The tempering temperature range for WP24 shall be as \nin 8.3.3. \n8.5.1 Liquid quenching followed by tempering for grades \nWPll Class 3 and WP22 Class 3 shall be permitted at the \nmanufacturer's option unless otherwise provided in the pur\u00ad\nchase order. The minimum tempering temperature for WPll \nClass 3 shall be 1150 \u00b0F [620 \u00b0C] and for WP22 Class 3 shall \nbe 1250 \u00b0F [675 \u00b0C]. \n9. Chemical Composition \n9 .1 The chemical composition of each cast or heat used \nshall be determined and shall conform to the requirements of \nthe chemical composition for the respective materials listed in \nTable 1. The ranges as shown have been expanded to include \nvariations of the chemical analysis requirements that are listed \nin the various specifications for the starting materials (pipe, \ntube, plate, bar, and forgings) normally used in the manufac\u00ad\nturing of fittings to this specification. \n9.2 The steel shall not contain any unspecified elements for \nthe ordered grade to the extent that it conforms to the \nrequirements of another grade for which that element is a \nspecified element having a required minimum content. \n9.3 Weld metal used in the construction of carbon-steel \nfittings shall be mild steel analysis No. Al of Table QW-442, \nSection IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, No. \nA2 may be used for Grade WPCW. \n9.4 The molybdenum and chromium content of the depos\u00ad\nited weld metal of alloy steel fittings shall be within the same \npercentage range as permitted for the base metal. \n9.5 Weld metal used in the construction of WP24 fittings \nshall be of the composition: 2.25 % Cr, 1 % Mo, 0.25 % V. \n10. Tensile Requirements \n10.1 The tensile properties of the fitting material shall \nconform to the requirements listed in Table 2. \n10.1.1 Longitudinal or transverse specimens cut from either \na fitting or from the starting plate or pipe they were manufac-\ntured from shall be acceptable for the tension test. For fittings \nmade from forgings, the test specimen shall meet the require\u00ad\nments of Specification Al05/A105M for the tension test. \n10.1.2 While Table 2 specifies elongation requirements for \nboth longitudinal and transverse specimens, it is not the intent \nthat both requirements apply simultaneously. Instead, it is \nintended that only the elongation requirement that is appropri\u00ad\nate for the specimen used be applicable. \n10.2 One tension test shall be made on each heat of material \nand in the same condition of heat treatment as the finished \nfittings it represents. Where plate or pipe is used for the test \nspecimen, the specimen thickness tested shall represent all \nfittings made from the same heat of material in the same heat \ntreat condition in any thickness up to and including the tested \nthickness. Same heat treatment condition means that the same \ntype of heat treatment (for example, stress relieve, normalize) \nand the same heat treating cycles (temperatures, time at \ntemperature (minimum), temperature uniformity of \u00b125 \u00b0F \n[\u00b114 \u00b0C], cooling method, etc.) are used (see 9.3 of Specifica\u00ad\ntion A960/A960M for furnace uniformity requirement). \n10.3 When cold-formed fittings are furnished, samples of \nthe raw material shall be normalized or stress relieved as \nrequired in 8.2.4. Tension tests conducted on these heat-treated \nsamples shall be considered to be the tensile properties of the \ncold-formed fittings. \n10.4 Records of raw material test report of the tension tests \nshall be certification that the material of the fitting meets the \ntensile requirements of this specification provided the heat \ntreatments of the finished fitting are the same as the raw \nmaterial test report. If the raw material was not tested, or the \nfitting is not in the same condition of heat treatment, the fitting \nmanufacturer shall perform the required test on material \nrepresentative of the finished fitting from each heat of starting \nmaterial. For fittings that are not heat treated in accordance \nwith 8.2.1 or 8.2.3, the raw material test report data can be used \nto represent the fitting properties provided the heat treatments \nare the same. \n10.5 When testing of the finished fittings is requested by the \npurchaser, see Supplementary Requirement S51 in Specifica\u00ad\ntion A960/ A960M. \n333 \n11. Hardness \n11.1 Except when only one fitting is produced, and except \nfor Grade WP91 Type 1 and Type 2, a minimum of two pieces \nper batch or continuous run shall be hardness tested to ensure \nthe fittings are within the following limits for each grade in \nTable 2. The purchaser may verify that the requirement has \nbeen met by testing at any location on the fitting provided such \ntesting does not render the fitting useless. \n11.1.1 Fittings of Grades WPS, WP9, and WPR-217 HBW \nmaximum. \n11.1.2 Fittings of Grade WP24 and WP911-248 HBW \nmaximum. \n11.1.3 Fittings of Grade WP92-269 HBW maximum. \n11.1.4 Fittings of all other grades-197 HBW maximum.
