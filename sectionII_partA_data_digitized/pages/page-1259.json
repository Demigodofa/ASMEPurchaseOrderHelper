Example: Type 630 at 1050\u00b0F [565\u00b0CJ must have \n13% elongation and 45% reduction, same as for age hardening at 1075\u00b0F [580\u00b0CJ. \nE (L) - Longitudinal axis of specimen parallel to direction of grain flow during rolling or forging. (Tl - Transverse axis of specimen perpendicular to direction of grain flow during rolling \nor forging. \nF See 6.2. \nG Either Rockwell C hardness or Brinell is permissible. On sizes 1/2 in. (12.70 mm) and smaller, Rockwell C is preferred. \nH Refer to Table 2 for details on equalize and over temper heat treatment. \n1 Applies to consumable electrode vacuum remelted. \nJ Only tensile strength applicable to sizes up to 1/ 2 in.
