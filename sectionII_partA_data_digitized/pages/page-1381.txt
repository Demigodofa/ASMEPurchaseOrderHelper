13.3.1.1 The reference standards defined in 13.9.1 - 13.9.4 
are convenient standards for calibration of nondestructive 
testing equipment. The dimensions of these standards should 
not be construed as the minimum size imperfection detectable 
by such equipment. 
13.3.1.2 The ultrasonic testing (UT) can be performed to 
detect both longitudinally and circumferentially oriented de­
fects. It should be recognized that different techniques should 
be employed to detect differently oriented imperfections. The 
examination may not detect short, deep, defects. 
13.3.1.3 The eddy-current testing (ET) referenced in this 
specification, (Practice E426), has the capability of detecting 
significant discontinuities, especially the short abrupt type. 
13.3.1.4 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature 
(type, size, location, and orientation) of discontinuities that can 
be detected in the specific application of these examinations 
should discuss this with the manufacturer of the tubular 
product. 
13.4 Time of Examination: 
13.4.1 Nondestructive testing for specification acceptance 
shall be performed after all mechanical processing, heat 
treatments, and straightening operations. This requirement 
does not preclude additional testing at earlier stages in the 
processing. 
13.5 Surface Condition: 
13.5.1 All surfaces shall be free of scale, dirt, grease, paint, 
or other foreign material that could interfere with interpretation 
of test results. The methods used for cleaning and preparing the 
surfaces for examination shall not be detrimental to the base 
metal or the surface finish. 
13.5.2 Excessive surface roughness or deep scratches can 
produce signals that interfere with the test. 
13.6 Extent of Examination: 
13.6.1 The relative motion of the pipe and the transducer(s), 
coil(s), or sensor(s) shall be such that the entire pipe surface is 
scanned, except as in 13.5.2. 
13.6.2 The existence of end effects is recognized, and the 
extent of such effects shall be determined by the manufacturer, 
and, if requested, shall be reported to the purchaser. Other 
nondestructive tests may be applied to the end areas, subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
13.7 Operator Qualifications: 
13. 7 .1 The test unit operator shall be certified in accordance 
with SNT-TC-lA, or an equivalent recognized and documented 
standard. 
13.8 Test Conditions: 
13.8.1 For eddy-current testing, the excitation coil fre­
quency shall be chosen to ensure adequate penetration yet 
provide good signal-to-noise ratio. 
13.8.2 The maximum eddy-current coil frequency used 
shall be as follows: 
On specified walls up to 0.050 in.-100 KHz max 
On specified walls up to 0.150 in.-50 KHz max 
On specified walls above 0.150 in.-10 KHz max 
13.8.3 Ultrasonic-For examination by the ultrasonic 
method, the minimum nominal transducer frequency shall be 
2.00 MHz and the maximum nominal transducer size shall be 
1.5 in. 
( 1) H the equipment contains a reject notice filter setting, 
this shall remain off during calibration and testing unless 
linearity can be demonstrated at that setting. 
13.9 Reference Standards: 
13.9.1 Reference standards of convenient length shall be 
prepared from a length of pipe of the same grade, size (NPS, or 
outside diameter and schedule or wall thickness), surface finish 
and heat treatment condition as the pipe to be examined. 
13.9.2 For Ultrasonic Testing, the reference ID and OD 
notches shall be any one of the three common notch shapes 
shown in Practice E213, at the option of the manufacturer. The 
depth of each notch shall not exceed 12½ % of the specified 
nominal wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in., whichever is 
greater. The width of the notch shall not exceed twice the 
depth. Notches shall be placed on both the OD and ID surfaces. 
13.9.3 For Eddy-Current Testing, the reference standard 
shall contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the 
following discontinuities: 
( 1) Drilled Hole-The reference standard shall contain 
three or more holes, equally spaced circumferentially around 
the pipe and longitudinally separated by a sufficient distance to 
allow distinct identification of the signal from each hole. The 
holes shall be drilled radially and completely through the pipe 
wall, with care being taken to avoid distortion of the pipe while 
drilling. One hole shall be drilled in the weld, if visible. 
Alternately, the producer of welded pipe may choose to drill 
one hole in the weld and run the calibration standard through 
the test coils three times with the weld turned at 120° on each 
pass. The hole diameter shall vary with NPS as follows: 
NPS Designator 
½ 
above½ to 1¼ 
above 1¼to 2 
above 2 to 5 
above 5 
Hole Diameter 
0.039 in. [1 mm] 
0.055 in. [1.4 mm] 
0.071 in. [1.8 mm] 
0.087 in. [2.2 mm] 
0.106 in. [2.7 mm] 
(2) Transverse Tangential Notch-Using a round tool or 
file with a ¼ in. [6.4 mm] diameter, a notch shall be filed or 
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu­
dinal axis of the pipe. Said notch shall have a depth not 
exceeding 12½ % of the specified nominal wall thickness of 
the pipe or 0.004 in. (0.102 mm), whichever is greater. 
( 3) Longitudinal Notch-A notch 0.031 in. or less in width 
shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the tube axis on 
the outside surface of the pipe, to have a depth not exceeding 
12½ % of the specified wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in., 
whichever is greater. The length of the notch shall be compat­
ible with the testing method. 
13.9.4 More or smaller reference discontinuities, or both, 
may be used by agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer. 
13.10 Standardization Procedure: 
13.10.1 The test apparatus shall be standardized at the 
beginning and end of each series of pipes of the same size 
(NPS or diameter and schedule or wall thickness), Grade and
