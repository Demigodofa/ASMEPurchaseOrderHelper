Scope \n1. 1 This specification covers requirements for \nquenched and tempered carbon and alloy steel forgings for \npressure vessel components. \n1.2 All grades are considered weldable under proper \nconditions. Welding technique is of fundamental impor\u00ad\ntance, and it is presupposed that welding procedure and \ninspection will be in accordance with approved methods \nfor the grade of material used. \nNOTE 1 - Grades 1 and lA have different chemistries but the same \nmechanical requirements. \nNOTE 2 - Designations have been changed as follows: \nCurrent \nGrade 1 \nGrade lA \nGrade lC \nGrade 2 Class 1 \nGrade 2 Class 2 \nGrade 3 Class 1 \nGrade 3 Class 2 \nGrade 4N Class 1 \n- - - - - - -Graae-21Nc1ass 2 \nGrade 4N Class 3 \nGrade 5 Class 1 \nGrade 5 Class 2 \nGrade 11 Class 4 \nGrade 22 Class 3 \nGrade 22 Class 4 \nGrade 22 Class 5 \nGrade 22V \nGrade 3V \nFormerly \nClass 1 \nClass lA \nClass 4 \nClass 2 \nClass 2A \nClass 3 \nClass 3A \n_C!_a~ 7_ \nClass 7A \nClass 7B \nClass 8 \nClass 8A \nClass llC \nClass 22B \nClass 22C \nClass 22D \nClass 22V \nClass 3V \n1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI \n(metric) units are to be regarded separately as the standard. \n920 \nWithin the text and tables, the SI units are shown in brack\u00ad\nets. The values stated in each system are not exact equiva\u00ad\nlents; therefore, each system must be used independently \nof the other. Combining values from the two systems may \nresult in nonconformance with the specification. \n1.4 Unless the order specifies the applicable \"M\" speci\u00ad\nfication designation, the material shall be furnished to the \ninch-pound units. \n2.
