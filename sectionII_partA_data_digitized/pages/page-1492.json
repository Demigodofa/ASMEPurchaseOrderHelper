Scope \n1.1 This specification covers a group of common \nrequirements that are mandatory for steel castings produced \nby the investment casting process for pressure-containing \nparts under each of the following ASTM Specifications: \nTitle of Specification \nSteel Castings, Carbon, Suitable for Fusion \nWelding for High-Temperature Service \nSteel Castings, Martensitic Stainless and Alloy, \nfor Pressure-Containing Parts, Suitable for \nHigh-Temperature Service \nCastings, Austenitic, Austenitic-Ferritic \n(Duplex), for Pressure-Containing Parts \nSteel Castings, Ferritic and Martensitic, for \nPressure-Containing Parts Suitable for Low\u00ad\nTemperature Service \nSteel Castings, Alloy, Specially Heat-Treated, \nfor Pressure-Containing Parts, Suitable for \nHigh Temperature Service \nSteel Castings Suitable for Pressure Service \nASTM \nDesignation \nA216/A 216M \nA217/A 217M \nA 351/A 351M \nA 352/A 352M \nA 389/A 389M \nA487/A487M \n1.2 This specification also covers a group of supple\u00ad\nmentary requirements, which may be applied to the above \nspecifications as indicated therein. These requirements are \nprovided for use when additional testing or inspection is \ndesired and apply only when specified individually by the \npurchaser in the order. \n1.3 When investment casting is ordered, the require\u00ad\nments of this specification shall take precedence over the \nindividual material specification requirements. \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as the standard. Within the \ntext, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nmust be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in nonconformance with \nthis specification. Inch-pound units are applicable for mate\u00ad\nrial ordered to Specification A 985 and SI units for material \nordered to Specification A 985M. \n1.5 This standard does not purport to address all of \nthe safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is \nthe responsibility of the user of this standard to establish \nappropriate safety and health practices and determine the \napplicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. \n2.
