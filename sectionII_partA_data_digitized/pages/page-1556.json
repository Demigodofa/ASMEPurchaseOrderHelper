The yield strength tends to increase, the elongation decreases and some of the \nformability values tend to decrease as the sheet thickness decreases. \n8 The typical mechanical property values presented here are nonmandatory. They are provided to assist the purchaser in specifying a suitable steel for a given application. \nValues outside of these ranges are to be expected. \nc Yield Strength and elongation are measured in the longitudinal direction in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. \n0 Average plastic strain ratio (rm value) as determined by Test Method E517. \nEThe strain hardening exponent (n-value) as determined by Test Method E646. \nF No typical properties have been established. \nTABLE 4 Mechanical Property RequirementsA for Cold Rolled \nSteel Sheet Designations SS, HSLAS, and HSLAS-F \nYield Strength, Tensile Elongation \nin \nDesignation min Strength, min 2 in. or \nksi [MPa] ksi [MPa] 50mm, \nmin,% \nSS: \nGrade 25 [170] 25 [170] 42 [290] 26 \nGrade 30 [205] 30 [205] 45 [310] 24 \nGrade 33 [230] Types 1 and 2 33 [230] 48 [330] 22 \nGrade 40 [275] Types 1 and 2 40 [275] 52 [360] 20 \nGrade 45 [310] 45 [310] 60 [410] 20 \nGrade 50 [340] 50 [340] 65 [450] 18 \nGrade 60 [410] 60 [410] 75 [520] 12 \nGrade 70 [480] 70 [480] 85 [585] 6 \nGrade 80 [550] 80 8 [550] 82 [565] C \nHSLAS: \nGrade 45 [310] Class 1 45 [310] 60 [410] 22 \nGrade 45 [310] Class 2 45 [310] 55 [380] 22 \nGrade 50 [340] Class 1 50 [340] 65 [450] 20 \nGrade 50 [340] Class 2 50 [340] 60 [410] 20 \nGrade 55 [380] Class 1 55 [380] 70 [480] 18 \nGrade 55 [380] Class 2 55 [380] 65 [450] 18 \nGrade 60 [41 OJ Class 1 60 [410] 75 [520] 16 \nGrade 60 [410] Class 2 60 [410] 70 [480] 16 \nGrade 65 [450] Class 1 65 [450] 80 [550] 15 \nGrade 65 [450] Class 2 65 [450] 75 [520] 15 \nGrade 70 [480] Class 1 70 [480] 85 [585] 14 \nGrade 70 [480] Class 2 70 [480] 80 [550] 14 \nHSLAS-F: \nGrade 50 [340] 50 [340] 60 [410] 22 \nGrade 60 [410] 60 [410] 70 [480] 18 \nGrade 70 [480] 70 [480] 80 [550] 16 \nGrade 80 [550] 80 [550] 90 [620] 14 \nA For coil products, testing by the producer is limited to the end of the coil. \nMechanical properties throughout the coil shall comply with the minimum values \nspecified. \n8 On this full-hard product, the yield strength approaches the tensile strength and \nsince there is no halt in the gauge or drop in the beam, the yield point shall be \ntaken as the yield stress at 0.5 % extension under load. \n0 There is no requirement for elongation In 2 in. for SS Grade 80. \n8.2.3 Tension Tests: \n8.2.3.1 Requirements-Material as represented by the test \nspecimen shall conform to the mechanical property require\u00ad\nments specified in Table 4.
