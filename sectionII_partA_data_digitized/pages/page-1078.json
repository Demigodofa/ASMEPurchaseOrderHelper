A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department qf Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification covers the general requirements for \nsteel sheet in coils and cut lengths. It applies to the following \nspecifications that describe carbon steel, structural steel, and \nhigh-strength, low-alloy steel (HSLA) furnished as hot-rolled \nsheet and cold-rolled sheet: Specifications A414/A414M, \nA424/A424M, A606/A606M, A659/A659M, A794/A794M, \nA1008/A1008M, AlOll/AlOllM, and Al039/A1039M. \n1.2 This specification is not applicable to hot-rolled heavy\u00ad\nthickness carbon sheet coils (Specification A635/A635M). \n1.3 In case of any conflict in requirements, the requirements \nof the individual material specification shall prevail over those \nof this general specification. \n1.4 For the purposes of determining conformance with this \nand the appropriate product specification referenced in 1. 1, \nmeasured values, calculated values, or observed values shall be \nrounded to the nearest unit in the right hand place of figures \nused in expressing the limiting values in accordance with the \nrounding method of Practice E29. \n1.4. l Ordered values, identified in tables, specified such as \nover 30 through 48 or 30 exclusive to 48 inclusive, covers all \nordered values specified as 30.1, 30.01, 30.001, etc., up to and \nincluding 48.000 etc., but does not cover ordered values \nspecified as3U.O00 etc., or less, nor does it cover ordered \nvalues specified as 48.1, 48.01, 48.001, etc. \n1.5 Annex Al lists permissible variations in dimensions and \nmass (see Note 1) in SI [metric] units. The values listed are not \nexact conversions of the values listed in the inch-pound tables, \nbut instead are rounded or rationalized values. Conformance to \nAnnex Al is mandatory when the \"M\" specification is used. \nNoTE 1-The term weight is used when inch-pound units are the \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee ADI on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.19 on Steel Sheet and Strip. \nCurrent edition approved Nov. I, 2019. Published November 2019. Originally \napproved in 1966. Last previous edition approved in 2019 as A568/A568M- 19. \nDOI: 10.l520/A0568_A0568M-19A. \nstandard. However, under SI the preferred term is mass. \n1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in non-conformance \nwith the standard. \n1. 7 This specification and the applicable material specifica\u00ad\ntions are expressed in both inch-pound units and SI units. \nHowever, unless the order specifies the applicable \"M\" speci\u00ad\nfication designation (SI units), the material shall be furnished \nto inch-pound units. \n1.8 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
