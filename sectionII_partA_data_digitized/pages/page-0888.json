A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \nThis standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers a group of general require\u00ad\nments that, unless otherwise specified in the purchase order or \nin an individual specification, shall apply to rolled steel plate, \nsheet, and strip, under each of the following specifications \nissued by ASTM: Specifications A240/A240M, A263, A264, \nA265, A666, A693, A793, and A895. \n1.2 In the case of conflict between a requirement of a \nproduct specification and a requirement of this specification, \nthe product specification shall prevail. In the case of conflict \nbetween a requirement of the product specification or a \nrequirement of this specification and a more stringent require\u00ad\nment of the purchase order, the purchase order shall prevail. \nThe purchase order requirements shall not take precedence if \nthey, in any way, violate the requirements of the product \nspecification or this specification; for example, by waiving a \ntest requirement or by making a test requirement less stringent. \n1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The SI units are \nshown in brackets, except that when A480M is specified, \nAnnex A3 shall apply for the dimensional tolerances and not \nthe bracketed SI values in Annex A2. The values stated in each \nsystem are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to \nensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be \nused independently of the other, and values from the two \nsystems shall not be combined. \n1.4 This specification and the applicable material specifica\u00ad\ntions are expressed in both inch-pound and SI units. However, \nunless the order specifies the applicable \"M\" specification \ndesignation [SI units], the material shall be furnished in \ninch-pound units. \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AOl on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nAO 1.17 on Flat-Rolled and Wrought Stainless Steel. \nCurrent edition approved Nov. 1, 2023. Published November 2023. Originally \napproved in 1962. Last previous edition approved in 2023 as A480/A480M-23a. \nDOI: 10.1520/A0480_A0480M-23B. \n2 For ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code applications see related Specifi\u00ad\ncation SA-480 in Section II of that Code. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
