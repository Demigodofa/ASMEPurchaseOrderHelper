A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editodal change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers minimum-wall-thickness, \nseamless cold-drawn carbon steel tubes including bending into \nthe form of U-tubes, if specified, for use in tubular feedwater \nheaters. \n1.2 The tubing sizes covered shall be 5/s to 1 \u00bc-in. [15.9 to \n31.8-mm] outside diameter, inclusive, with minimnm wall \nthicknesses equal to or greater than 0.045 in. [l. l mm]. \n1.3 Optional supplementary requirements are provided, and \nwhen desired, shall be stated in the order. \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as the standard. Within the text, \nthe SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must \nbe used independently of the other. Combining values from the \ntwo systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi\u00ad\ncation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \nl .5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n- 2-:-Referenced-Documenfs -\n2.1 ASTM Standards: 3 \nA450/A450M Specification for General Requirements for \nCarbon and Low Alloy Steel Tubes \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0!.09 on Carbon Steel Tubular Products. \nCurrent edition approved Sept. !, 2018. Published September 2018. Originally \napproved in 1965. Last previous edition approved in 2012 as A556/A556M - 96 \n(2012).

Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for material under this specification should \ninclude the following as required to describe the desired \nmaterial adequately: \n3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of pieces), \n3.1.2 Name of material (seamless steel tubing), \n3.1.3 Dimensions (outside diameter and minimum wall \nthickness), \n3.1.4 Length (specific or random), \n3.1.5 Manufacture (cold drawn), \n3.1.6 Grade (chemical composition), \n3.1.7 Optional requirements, \n3.1.8 Bending Requirements-If order specifies tubes to be \nbent, the design of the U-tubes shall accompany the order. \nPurchaser must specify if stress-relief anneal of the U-bends is \nrequired, \n3.1.9 Test report required (see Certification Section of \nSpecification A450/ A450M), \n3 .1.10 Specification number, and \n3 .1.11 Special requirements and any supplementary require\u00ad\nments selected. \n_ 4. General Reqmrement_g_ \n4.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to \nthe applicable requirements of the current edition of the \nSpecification A450/A450M, unless otherwise provided herein. \n5. Manufacture \n5.1 Manufacture-Tubes shall be made by the seamless \nprocess and shall be cold drawn. \n5.2 Heat Treatment: \n5.2.1 Cold-drawn tubes shall be heat treated after the final \ncold-draw pass at a temperature of 1200\u00b0F [640\u00b0C] or higher to \nensure ductility satisfactory for rolling into tube sheets and to \nmeet mechanical properties as specified. \n5.2.2 If stress-relief anneal of the U-bends is specified, the \nanneal shall consist of heating the bent portion within a range \nof 1100 to 1200\u00b0F [585 to 640\u00b0C]. \n* A Summary of Changes section appears at the end of this standard \n944 ",
