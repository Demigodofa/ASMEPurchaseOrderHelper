A The maximum manganese may be increased to 1.60 % on heat analysis and 
1. 72 % on product analysis, provided that the carbon content on heat analysis 
does not exceed 0.18 %. 
8 Columbium and niobium are interchangeable names for the same element and 
both names are acceptable for use in A01 specifications.

A See Specification A20/A20M for elongation adjustment. 
5.2 If approved by the purchaser, cooling rates faster than 
air cooling are permitted for improvement of strength or 
toughness, provided the plates are subsequently tempered in 
the temperature range from 1100 to 1300°F [595 to 705°C]. 
5.3 When the fabricator elects to perform the heat treatment 
in 5.1 and 5.2, the manufacturer shall normalize plates con­
forming to Grade C within the range from 1650 to 1850oF [900 
to 1010oC] prior to shipment for plates exceeding 2 in. [50 
mm] in thickness unless otherwise agreed to. 
6. Chemical Requirements 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition prescribed in Table 1 unless otherwise 
modified in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S 17, 
Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized Steel, in Specification A20/ 
A20M. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7 .1 Tension Tests-The material as represented by the ten­
sion test specimens shall conform to the requirements shown in 
Table 2. 
7.1.1 For nominal plate thicknesses of¾ in. [20 mm] and 
under, when requirements for elongation in 2 in. [50 mm] are 
to be determined, the 1 ½-in. [40-mm] wide rectangular speci­
men may be used for the tension test, and the elongation may 
be determined in a 2-in. [50-mm] gage length that includes the 
fracture and that shows the greatest elongation. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
Supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the purchase order. 
A list of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser is included 
in Specification A20/ A20M. Several of those considered suitable for use with this specification are 
listed below by title. Other tests may be performed by agreement between the supplier and the 
purchaser. 
S 1. Vacuum Treatment, 
S2. Product Analysis, 
S3. Simulated Post-Weld Heat Treatment of Mechanical 
Test Coupons, 
S5. Charpy V-Notch Impact Tests, 
S8. Ultrasonic Examination in accordance with Specifica­
tion A435/A435M, 
S 11. Ultrasonic Examination in accordance with Specifica­
tion A577 / A577M, 
Sl2. Ultrasonic Examination in accordance with Specifica­
tion A578/A578M, and
