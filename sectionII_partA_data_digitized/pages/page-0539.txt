4.2.7.1 Each set of weld metal impact test specimens shall 
be taken across the weld with the notch in the weld metal. Each 
test specimen shall be oriented so that the notch is normal to 
the surface of the material and one face of the specimen shall 
be within 1/16 in. [1.5 mm] of the surface of the material. 
4.2.7.2 Each set of heat affected zone impact test specimens 
shall be taken across the weld and of sufficient length to locate, 
after etching, the notch in the heat affected zone. The notch 
shall be cut approximately normal to the surface of the material 
in such a manner as to include as much heat affected zone 
material as possible in the resulting fracture. 
NoTE 3-The term "lot" applies to all pipe (may include more than one 
heat of steel) within a 3/16 in. [4.7 mm] range of thickness and welded to 
the weld procedure, and when heat treated, clone to the same heat-treating 
procedure and in the same furnace. The maximum lot size shall be 200 
linear ft [60 m] of pipe. 
4.3 Heat Treatment: 
4.3.1 All seamless and welded pipe, other than Grades 8 and 
11, shall be treated to control their microstructure in accor­
dance with one of the following methods: 
4.3.l.1 Normalize by heating to a uniform temperature of 
not less than 1500 °P [815 °C] and cool in air or in the cooling 
chamber of an atmosphere controlled furnace. 
4.3.l.2 Normalize as in 4.3.1.1, and, at the discretion of the 
manufacturer, reheat to a suitable tempering temperature. 
4.3.1.3 For the seamless process only, reheat and control hot 
working and the temperature of the hot-finishing operation to a 
finishing temperature range from 1550 to 1750 °P [845 to 945 
°C] and cool in air or in a controlled atmosphere furnace from 
an initial temperature of not less than 1550 °P [845 °C]. 
4.3.1.4 Treat as in 4.3. l.3 and, at the discretion of the 
manufacturer, reheat to a suitable tempering temperature. 
4.3.1.5 Seamless pipe of Grades 1, 6, and 10 may be heat 
treated by heating to a uniform temperature of not less than 
1500 °P [815 °C], followed by quenching in liquid and 
reheating to a suitable tempering temperature, in place of any 
of the other heat treatments provided for in 4.3.1. 
4.3.2 Grade 8 pipe shall be heat treated by the manufacturer 
by either of the following methods: 
4.3.2.1 Quenched and Tempered-Heat to a uniform tem­
perature of 1475 :±: 25 °P [800 :±: 15 °C]; hold at this 
temperature for a minimum time in the ratio of 1 h/in. [2 
min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 15 min; quench 
by immersion in circulating water. Reheat until the pipe attains 
a unifonn temperature within the range from 1050 to 1125 °P 
[565 to 605 °C]; hold at this temperature for a minimum time 
in the ratio of I h/in. [2 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case 
less than 15 min; cool in air or water quench at a rate no less 
than 300 °P [165 °C]/h. 
4.3.2.2 Double Normalized and Tempered-Heat to a uni­
form temperature of 1650 :±: 25 °P [900 :±: 15 °C]; hold at this 
temperature for a minimum time in the ratio of 1 h/in. [2 
min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 15 min; cool in 
air. Reheat until the pipe attains a unifonn temperature of 1450 
:±: 25 °P [790 :±: 15 °C]; hold at this temperature for a 
minimum time in the ratio of 1 h/in. [2 min/mm] of thickness, 
but in no case less than 15 min; cool in air. Reheat to nmiform 
temperature within the range from 1050 to 1125 °P [565 to 605 
0 C]; hold at this temperature for a minimum time of 1 h/in. [2 
min/mm] of thickness but in no case less than 15 min; cool in 
air or water quench at a rate not less than 300 °P [165 °C]/h. 
4.3.3 Whether to anneal Grade 11 pipe is per agreement 
between purchaser and supplier. When Grade 11 pipe is 
annealed, it shall be normalized in the range of 1400 to 1600 °P 
[760 to 870 °C]. 
4.3.4 Material from which test specimens are obtained shall 
be in the same condition of heat treatment as the pipe 
furnished. Material from which specimens are to be taken shall 
be heat treated prior to preparation of the specimens. 
4.3.5 When specified in the order the test specimens shall be 
taken from full thi.ckness test pieces which have been stress 
relieved after having been removed from the heat-treated pipe. 
The test pieces shall be gradually and uniformly heated to the 
prescribed temperature, held at that temperature for a period of 
time in accordance with Table 5, and then furnace cooled at a 
temperature not exceeding 600 °P [315 °C]. Grade 8 shall be
