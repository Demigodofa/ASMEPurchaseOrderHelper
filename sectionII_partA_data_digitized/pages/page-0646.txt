lengths over 2 in. A percentage scale reading to 0.5 % of the 
gauge length may be used. The elongation is the increase in 
length of the gauge length, expressed as a percentage of the 
01iginal gauge length. In recording elongation values, give both 
the percentage increase and the original gauge length. 
14.4.2 If any part of the fracture takes place outside of the 
middle half of the gauge length or in a punched or scribed mark 
within the reduced section, the elongation value obtained may 
not be representative of the material. If the elongation so 
measured meets the minimum requirements specified, no 
further testing is indicated, but if the elongation is less than the 
minimum requirements, discard the test and retest. 
14.4.3 Automated tensile testing methods using extensom­
eters allow for the measurement of elongation in a method 
described below. Elongation may be measured and reported 
either this way, or as in the method described above, fitting the 
broken ends together. Either result is valid. 
14.4.4 Elongation at fracture is defined as the elongation 
measured just prior to the sudden decrease in force associated 
with fracture. For many ductile materials not exhibiting a 
sudden decrease in force, the elongation at fracture can be 
taken as the strain measured just prior to when the force falls 
below 10 % of the maximum force encountered during the test. 
14.4.4.1 Elongation at fracture shall include elastic and 
plastic elongation and may be determined with autographic or 
automated methods using extensometers verified over the 
strain range of interest. Use a class B2 or better extensometer 
for materials having less than 5 % elongation; a class C or 
better extensometer for materials having elongation greater 
than or equal to 5 % but less than 50 %; and a class D or better 
extensometer for materials having 50 % or greater elongation. 
In all cases, the extensometer gauge length shall be the nominal 
gauge length required for the specimen being tested. Due to the 
lack of precision in fitting fractured ends together, the elonga­
tion after fracture using the manual methods of the preceding 
paragraphs may differ from the elongation at fracture deter­
mined with extensometers. 
14.4.4.2 Percent elongation at fracture may be calculated 
directly from elongation at fracture data and be reported 
instead of percent elongation as calculated in 14.4.1. However, 
these two parameters are not interchangeable. Use of the 
elongation at fracture method generally provides more repeat­
able results. 
14.5 Reduction of Area-Fit the ends of the fractured 
specimen together and measure the mean diameter or the width 
and thickness at the smallest cross section to the same accuracy 
as the original dimensions. The difference between the area 
thus found and the area of the original cross section expressed 
594 
as a percentage of the original area is the reduction of area.
