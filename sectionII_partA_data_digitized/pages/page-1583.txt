A Except as provided in 10.2 and 10.3, these permitted variations include 
out-of-roundness. These permitted variations in outside diameter apply to hot­
finished seamless, welded and cold-finished seamless tubes before other fabri­
cating operations such as upsetting, swaging, expanding, bending, or polishing. 
10.3 For cold-finished seamless austenitic and ferritic/ 
austenitic tubes, an ovality allowance is necessary for all sizes 
less than 2 in. [50.8 mm] outside diameter, because they are 
likely to become out of round during their final heat treatment. 
For such tubes, the maximum and minimum outside diameter 
at any cross section shall not deviate from the nominal 
diameter by more than ±0.010 in. [±0.25 mm]. However, the 
mean diameter at that cross section must still be within the 
given permitted variation given in Table 3. In the event of 
conflict between the provisions of 10.2.1 and those of 10.3, the 
larger value of ovality tolerance shall apply. 
10.4 When the specified wall is 2 % or less of the specified 
OD, the method of measurement is per agreement between 
purchaser and manufacturer (see Note 2). 
Nom 2-Very thin wall tubing may not be stiff enough for the outside 
diameter to be accurately measured with a point contact method, such as 
with the use of a micrometer or caliper. When very thin walls are 
specified, "go" - "no go" ring gauges are commonly used to measure 
diameters of 1 ½ in. [38.1 mm] or less. A 0.002 in. [0.05 mm] additional 
tolerance is usually added on the "go" ring gauge to allow clearance for 
sliding. On larger diameters, measurement is commonly performed with a 
pi tape. Other methods, such as optical methods, may also be considered. 
11. Permitted Variations in Length 
11.1 Variations from the specified length shall not exceed 
the amounts prescribed in Table 4. 
12. Permitted Variations in Height of Flash on Electric­
Resistance-Welded Tubes 
12.1 For tubes over 2 in. [50.8 mm] in outside diameter, or 
over 0.135 in. [3.44 mm] in wall thickness, the flash on the 
inside of the tubes shall be mechanically removed by cutting to 
a maximum height of 0.010 in. [0.25 mm] at any point on the 
tube. 
12.2 For tubes 2 in. [50.8 mm] and under in outside 
diameter and 0.135 in. [3.44 mm] and under in wall thickness, 
the flash on the inside of the tube shall be mechanically 
removed by cutting to a maximum height of 0.006 in. [0.15 
mm] at any point on the tube. 
13. Straightness and Finish 
13.1 Finished tubes shall be reasonably straight and have 
smooth ends free of burrs. They shall have a workmanlike 
finish. It is permitted to remove surface imperfections by 
grinding, provided that a smooth curved surface is maintained, 
and the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that 
permitted by this or the product specification, or the purchase 
order. The outside diameter at the point of grinding may be 
reduced by the amount so removed. 
14. Repair by Welding 
14.1 Repair welding of base metal defects in tubing is 
permitted only with the approval of the purchaser and with the 
further understanding that the tube shall be marked "WR" and 
the composition of the deposited filler metal shall be suitable 
for the composition being welded. Defects shall be thoroughly 
chipped or ground out before welding and each repaired length 
shall be reheat treated or stress relieved as required by the 
applicable specification. Each length of repaired tube shall be 
examined by a nondestructive test as required by the product 
specification. 
14.2 Repair welding shall be performed using procedures 
and welders or welding operators that have been qualified in 
accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, 
Section IX.

to cut lengths up to and including 24 ft [7 .3 m]. For lengths greater than 24 ft [7 .3 
m], the above over-tolerances shall be increased by 1/a in. (3 mm] for each 1 Oft [3 
m] or fraction thereof over 24 ft or ½ in. [13 mm], whichever is the lesser.
