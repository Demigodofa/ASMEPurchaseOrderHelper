SA-250/SA-ZS0M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Electric-Resistance-Welded Ferritic Alloy-Steel Boiler and 
Superheater Tubes 
1. Scope 
1. l This specification covers several grades, designated Tl, 
Tla, Tlb, T2, Tll, Tl2 and T22, of minimum-wall-thickness, 
electric-resistance-welded, carbon-molybdenum and 
chromium-molybdenum alloy-steel, boiler and superheater 
tubes. 
1.2 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are ½ to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside 
diameter and 0.035 to 0.320 in. [0.9 to 8.1 mm], inclusive, in 
minimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may 
be furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than 1/s in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.4 An optional supplementary requirement is provided for 
non-destructive examination for certain ASME applications. 
1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be reaagrded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining 
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance 
with the standard. 
1.5.1 Within the text, the SI units are shown in brackets. 
1.5.2 The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order.

3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for material under this specification should 
include the following, as required, to describe the desired 
material adequately: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material (electric-resistance-welded tubes), 
3.1.3 Grade (Table 1), 
3.1.4 Size (outside diameter or minimum wall thickness), 
3.1.5 Length (specific or random), 
3.1.6 Optional requirement (7.3.6), 
3.1.7 Test report required (see Certification Section of 
Specification Al016/Al016M), 
3.1.8 Specification designation, and . 
3.1.9 Special requirements and any supplementary require­
ments selected. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 Product furnished under this specification shall conform 
to the applicable requirements of Specification Al016/ 
Al016M, including any supplementary requirements that are 
indicated in the purchase order. Failure to comply with the 
general requirements of Specification A1016/A1016M consti­
tutes nonconformance with this specification. In case of con­
flicts with the requirements of this specification and Specifi­
cation Al016/Al016M, this specification shall prevail. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 The steel shall be killed. 
5.2 The tubes shall be made by electric-resistance welding. 
5.3 Heat Treatment 
5.3.1 After welding, or when cold finished, after the final 
cold-drawing pass, all tubes shall be heat treated and, except as 
provided in 5.3.2, furnished in the full annealed, isothermal 
annealed, normalized, or normalized and tempered condition at
