ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-20/SA-20M 
account current production and processing capabilities. To 
qualify any plate to a particular product specification requires 
that all appropriate and necessary tests be performed and that 
the results meet the limits prescribed in that product specifi­
cation. If the necessary tests required by a product specification 
can not be conducted, the plate can not be qualified to that 
specification. This general requirements specification contains 
permitted variations for the commonly available sizes. Permit­
ted variations for other sizes are subject to agreement between 
the purchaser and the manufacturer or processor, whichever is 
applicable. 
3.1.11 precipitation heat treatment-a subcritical tempera­
ture thermal treatment performed to cause precipitation of 
submicroscopic constituents, and so forth, to result in enhance­
ment of some desirable property. 
3.1.12 processor-the organization that directly controls, or 
is responsible for, operations involved in the processing of coil 
into finished plates. Such processing operations include 
decoiling, leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, 
conditioning, heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, 
marking, loading for shipment, and certification. 
3.1.12.1 Discussion-The processing operations need not be 
done by the organization that did the hot rolling of the coil. If 
only one organization is involved in the hot rolling and 
processing operations, that organization is termed the manu­
facturer for the hot rolling operation and the processor for the 
processing operations. If more than one organization is in­
volved in the hot rolling and processing operations, the 
organization that did the hot rolling is termed the manufacturer 
and the organization that does one or more processing opera­
tions is termed a processor. 
3.2 Refer to Terminology A941 for additional terms used in 
this standard. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 Orders should include the following information, as 
necessary, to adequately describe the desired product. 
4.1.1 Quantity (weight [mass] or number of plates), 
4.1.2 Dimensions, 
4.1.3 Name of product (for example, plates, carbon steel; 
plates, alloy steel), 
4.1.4 Specification designation (including type, class, and 
grade as applicable) and year-date, 
4.1.5 Condition (as-rolled, normalized, quenched and 
tempered, etc. If heat treatment of plate is to be performed by 
the fabricator, this is to be stated. Also, if purchaser specifies a 
heat-treatment cycle, this is to be stated), 
4.1.6 Impact test requirements, if any (see Section 12). (For 
Charpy V-notch test, include test specimen orientation, testing 
temperature, and acceptance criteria. For drop-weight test, give 
testing temperature), 
4.1.7 Exclusion of either plates produced from coil or plates 
produced from plate-as-rolled, if applicable. (See 5.4 and 
Appendix XL) 
4.1.8 Limits for grain refining elements other than 
aluminum, if applicable (see 8.3.2), 
4.1.9 Paint marking (see 13.2.1), 
71 
4.1.10 Supplementary requirements, if any (test specimen 
heat treatment, special impact test requirements, etc.), 
4.1.11 Provisions for delivery with mill edges and any 
special permissible variations (see 14.4), and 
4.1.12 Additional requirements, if any. 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 The steel shall be made in an open-hearth, basic-oxygen, 
or electric-arc furnace, possibly followed by additional refining 
in a ladle metallurgy furnace (LMF), or by another method; or 
secondary melting by vacuum-arc remelting (VAR), electro­
slag remelting (ESR), or another method. 
5.2 The steel may be strand cast or cast in stationary molds. 
5.2.1 Strand Cast Slabs: 
5.2.1.1 If heats of the same nominal chemical composition 
are consecutively strand cast at one time, the heat number 
assigned to the cast product (slab) may remain unchanged until 
all of the steel in the slab is from the following heat. 
5.2.1.2 When two consecutively strand cast heats have 
different nominal chemical composition ranges, the manufac­
turer shall remove the transition material by any established 
procedure that positively separates the grades. 
5.3 The ratio of reduction of thickness from a strand-cast 
slab to plate shall be at least 3.0:1, except that reduction ratios 
as low as 2.0: 1 are permitted if all of the following limitations 
are met: 
5.3.1 The purchaser agrees to the use of such reduction 
ratios. 
5.3.2 The applicable product specification is A299/A299M, 
A515/A515M, A516/A516M, A537/A537M, A662/A662M, or 
A737/A737M. 
5.3.3 The specified plate thickness is 3.0 in. [75 mm] or 
more. 
5.3.4 One or more of the following low hydrogen practices 
are used: vacuum degassing during steelmak:ing; controlled 
soaking of the slabs or plates; or controlled slow cooling of the 
slabs or plates. 
5.3.5 The sulfur content is 0.004 % or less, based upon heat 
analysis. 
5.3.6 One or more of the following practices are used: 
electromagnetic stirring during strand casting; soft reduction 
during strand casting; heavy pass reductions or other special 
practices during plate rolling; or combined forging and rolling 
during plate rolling. 
5.3.7 The plates are ultrasonically examined in accordance 
with Specification A578/A578M, Level C based on continuous 
scanning over 100 % of the plate surface. 
5.3.8 The plates are through-thickness tension tested in 
accordance with Specification A770/A770M. 
5.4 Unless otherwise specified in the purchase order, plates 
shall be produced from plate-as-rolled or from coil. 
5.5 Coils are excluded from qualification to the applicable 
product specification until they are decoiled, leveled, cut to 
length, and tested by the processor in accordance with the 
specified requirements (see Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 
16, and 20.)
