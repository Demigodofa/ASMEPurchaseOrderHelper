SlO. Charpy V-Notch Impact Transition Curve Sl9. Restricted Chemical Requirements 
S 10.1 Sufficient impact tests of the same specimen size shall 
be made from the plate test material to establish a transition 
curve. The test temperature range shall be wide enough to 
establish the upper and lower shelf energies, with sufficient 
testing at intermediate temperatures to permit plotting a rea­
sonable smooth curve. A plot of the data is not required. The 
manufacturer shall report the specimen orientation, test 
temperature, and absorbed energy for each specimen tested. 
Lateral expansion and percent shear shall also be reported 
when specified in the purchase order. The number of plates 
tested and the specimen orientation shall be the same as in 12.1 
unless otherwise specified in the purchase order. 
Sll. Ultrasonic Examination in Accordance with A577/ 
A577M 
Sll.1 All plates shall be ultrasonically examined in accor­
dance with the requirements of Specification A577 I A577M. 
S12. Ultrasonic Examination in Accordance with A578/ 
A578M 
Sl2.1 All plates shall be ultrasonically examined in accor­
dance with the requirements of Specification A578/A578M. 
The acceptance level shall be as specified in the RUrchase order. 
S13. NDT Temperature Determination 
S13.1 The NDT temperature shall be established in accor­
dance with Test Method E208 using coupons from a single 
plate. The number of plates to be so tested shall be subject to 
agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer or 
processor. 
Sl5. Reduction of Area Measurement 
S 15 .1 A reduction of area measurement shall be taken while 
making the required tension test. Reduction of area shall be 
determined only-on the 0.500-in. [12.5-mm] round specimen as 
shown in Fig. 5 of Test Methods and Definitions A370. The 
minimum acceptance limit shall be 40 % . 
S16. Thermal Stress Relief of Mechanical Test Coupons 
S16.1 Test coupons representing the plates shall be ther­
mally stress relieved by gradually and uniformly heating them 
to a temperature between 1100 and 1200°F [595 and 650°C], or 
a temperature range otherwise agreed upon between the 
manufacturer or processor and the purchaser, holding at tem­
perature for at least 1 h/in. [2.4 min/mm] of thickness and 
cooling in still air to a temperature not exceeding 600°F 
[315°C]. 
S17. Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized Steel 
S 17 .1 Material shall be vacuum carbon-deoxidized, in 
which case the silicon content at the time of vacuum deoxi­
dizing shall be 0.12 % maximum, and the content of deoxidiz­
ers such as aluminum, zirconium, and titanium should be kept 
low enough to allow deoxidation by carbon. The test report 
shall indicate that the steel was vacuum carbon-deoxidized. 
The minimum heat analysis and product analysis requirements 
for silicon do not apply to vacuum carbon-deoxidized steel.

S 19 .1 Restricted heat analysis and product analysis limits 
are applicable, as specified in the purchase order. 
S20. Maximum Carbon Equivalent for Weldability 
S20.1 Plates shall be supplied with a specific maximum 
carbon equivalent value. This value shall be based upon the 
heat analysis. The required chemical analysis as well as the 
carbon equivalent shall be reported. 
S20.2 The carbon equivalent shall be calculated using the 
following formula: 
CE= C+Mn/6+(Cr+Mo+V)/5+(Ni+Cu)/15 
S20.3 The maximum value of the carbon equivalent for 
carbon steels (including C-Mn, C-Mn-Si, C-Mn-Si-Al steels), 
are given in Table S20.1. 
S21. Restricted Limits on Elements 
For each heat, based upon the heat analysis, the content shall 
not exceed 0.35 % for copper, 0.25 % for nickel, 0.25 % for 
chromium, 0.08 % for molybdenum, or 0.70 % for the sum of 
those four elements. 
S22. Through-Thickness Tension Tests 
S22.l Through-thickness tension tests shall be made in 
accordance with the requirements of Specification A 770/ 
A770M. (See Ordering Information in Specification A770/ 
A770M for the additional information that may be needed.) 
S24. Strain Age Test 
S24.1 Test coupons shall be given a strain age treatment 
designated by the purchaser. Charpy V-notch tests shall be 
conducted on the strain aged specimens. Heat treatment, strain 
aging, test temperature, and acceptance criteria shall be as 
agreed upon between the manufacturer or processor and the 
purchaser. 
S25. Weldability 
S25.l Weldability tests shall 
be conducted. The type of test and the acceptance criteria 
shall be as agreed upon between the manufacturer or processor 
and the purchaser.
