If it is deter\u00ad\nmined that a particular source standard can be of use \nfor BPVC purposes, then it is modified as necessary to \nconform to BPVC requirements, and subsequently pub\u00ad\nlished in Section II as an ASME material specification. A \nlist of all ASME material specifications is in the \"Specifica\u00ad\ntion\" column of Tables 11-200-1 and 11-200-2. \n11-200 SOURCE STANDARDS \nThe source standard from which an ASME material \nspecification was derived is part of the specification's des\u00ad\nignation, as shown below. \nASME Material \nSpecification Designation \nSA-217 /SA-217M \nSA/AS-1548 \nSA/CSA-G40.21 \nSB-166 \nSF-568M \nSA/EN 10028-2 \nSA/GB 713 \nSA/IS 2062 \nSA/JlS G3118 \nSource Standard \nASTM A217 /A217M \nAS 1548 \nCSA G40.21 \nASTM B166 \nASTM F568M \nEN 10028-2 \nGB 713 \nIS 2062 \nJSA-JIS G 3118 \nStandards Organization \nASTM International \nStandards Australia \nCSA Group \nASTM International \nASTM International \nEuropean Committee for \nStandardization \nStandardization \nAdministration of China \nBureau of Indian Standards \nJapanese Industrial \nStandards \nThe \"Latest Adopted\" column of Tables 11-200-1 and \n11-200-2 states which edition (revision) of the source \nstandard is the framework for the current ASME material \nspecification. The \"Description\" column explains any \nchanges made to the source standard when it was \nadopted as an ASME material specification. \n11-300 PERMISSIBILITY OF SUPERSEDED \nEDITIONS FOR ASME CONSTRUCTION \nAt times, the publishing organization will update its \nstandard and supersede the previous edition. When this \noccurs, the BPVC II committee may choose to evaluate \nthe update and adopt it as the framework for the ASME \nmaterial specification. \nThe Section II committee may also choose to continue \nto allow for Code construction a previously accepted \nbut now superseded edition. If allowed, the Statement \nof Policy on the Use of ASME Material Specifications is in\u00ad\nvoked and caveats listed in the \"Description\" column shall \nbe met. Any superseded editions permitted are refer\u00ad\nenced in the column \"All Acceptable Editions\" of Tables \n11-200-1 and 11-200-2. \nIf no superseded editions are currently permitted for \nuse, then ellipses ( ... ) will appear in the \"All Acceptable \nEditions\" column. \n11-400 STRUCTURE OF ASME MATERIAL \nSPECIFICATIONS \nThis paragraph gives examples of deciphering from \nTables 11-200-1 and 11-200-2 the structure of ASME mate\u00ad\nrial specifications as well as which editions of a source \nstandard are permitted for use. These examples are based \non Figure II-400-1. The specifications in the figure are \nbased on editions found in BPVC Section II, Parts A and \nB, 2021 Edition. \n(a) SA-217/SA-217M. The standard adopted was ASTM \nA217 /A217M. The 2007 edition (A217 /A217M-07) is \nthe latest adopted. The word \"Identical\" is listed in the \n\"Description\" column; this means that ASME material \nspecification SA-217 /SA-217M is identical to ASTM \nA217 /A217M-07. The \"All Acceptable Editions\" column \nindicates that revisions 1993 through 2007, inclusive, \nare permitted for construction. \n(b) SA-513. The standard adopted was ASTM A513. The \n2000 edition (A513-00) is the latest adopted. The \"De\u00ad\nscription\" column indicates that for the ASTM specifica\u00ad\ntion to be used as ASME material specification SA-513, \nits Supplementary Requirements S6 and either S7 or SB \nare mandatory. Ellipses ( ... ) are listed under the \"All Ac\u00ad\nceptable Editions\" column. This means that only the edi\u00ad\ntion listed under the \"Latest Adopted\" column - ASTM \nA513-00 - is permitted for Code construction. \n(c) SA/CSA G40.21. The standard adopted was CSA \nG40.21. The latest edition adopted is 2013(R2018). This \nmeans that the 2018 edition is the latest adopted, and that \nit is a reapproval of the 2013 edition [(CSA G40.21-2013 \n(R2018)]. The ASME material specification was modified \nto have additional requirements for marking, chemical \ncomposition, controlled and normalized rolling, and pro\u00ad\nviding a test report. The only CSA G40.21 editions per\u00ad\nmitted for construction are 1992, and 2004 through \n2018, inclusive. \n(d) SB-166. The standard adopted was ASTM B166, \n2011 edition (B166-11). The ASME material specification \nhas been modified to require certification and test report \nbe given to the purchaser; and that the details of \n1610 ",
