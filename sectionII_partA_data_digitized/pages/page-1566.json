Scope \n1.1 This specification covers martensitic stainless steels \nfor various structural, architectural, pressure vessel, and \nheat-resisting applications. The mechanical properties of \nthese steels are customarily, but not necessarily, developed \nby a suitable heat treatment generally referred to as tem\u00ad\npering. \n1.2 Steel products under this specification are available \nin two grades: \nGrade \n40 [275) \n50 [350] \nYield Strength, min, ksi \n[MPa] \n40 [275) \n50 [350) \n1.3 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only \nby the capacity of the composition to meet the specified \nmechanical property requirements; however, current prac\u00ad\ntice normally limits the maximum thickness of plates fur\u00ad\nnished under this specification to 1 in. [25 mm]. \n1.4 The values stated in inch-pound or SI units are to \nbe regarded separately as the standard. Within the text, SI \nunits are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nmust be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in nonconformance with \nthe specification. The inch-pound units shall apply unless \nthe \"M\" designation of this specification is specified in the \npurchase order. \n2.
