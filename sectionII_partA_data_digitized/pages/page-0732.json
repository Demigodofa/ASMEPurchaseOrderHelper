[2.1 mm], no metal impres\u00ad\nsion stamps shall be used. Vibrating pencil marking is accept\u00ad\nable. \n15.1.3 Threaded or socket-welding fittings shall be addi\u00ad\ntionally marked with the pressure class. Plugs and bushings \nfurnished to ASME B 16.11 reqnirements are not required to be \nmarked. The class S marking need not be added to the material \ngrade for threaded or socket-welded fittings. \n15.1.4 When agreed upon between the purchaser and \nproducer, and specified in the order, the markings shall be \npainted or stenciled on the fitting or stamped on a metal or \nplastic tag which shall be securely attached to the fitting. \n15.1.5 Fittings meeting the chemical and mechanical prop\u00ad\nerty requirements of Table 2 and Table 5 for more than one \ngrade designation may be marked with more than one class or \ngrade designation, such as WP304/304H; WP304/304L; \nWP304/304L/304N, WP316/316L, etc. \n15.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 15.1, \nbar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification \nmethod. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar \ncoding system to be used. The bar coding system, if applied at \nthe discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one of \nthe published industry standards for bar coding. If used on \nsmall fittings, the bar code may be applied to the box or a \nsubstantially applied tag. \n16. Keywords \n16.l austenitic stainless steel; corrosive service applica\u00ad\ntions; pipe fittings; steel; piping applications; pressure contain\u00ad\ning parts; stainless steel fittings \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nOne or more of the supplementary requirements described below or appearing in Specification \nA960/ A960M may be included in the order or contract. When so included, a supplementary \nrequirement shall have the same force as if it were in the body of the specification. Supplementary \nrequirement details not fully described shall be agreed upon between the purchaser and the supplier. \nSl. Special Filler Metal \nSl.l Filler metal shall be AWS Type E16-8-2 or ER 16-8-2 \n(AWS Specifications A 5.4 and A 5.9, respectively). Fittings \nwelded with 16-8-2 weld metal shall be marked WP_ HRW \nor CR _ HRW, as appropriate. \nS2. Stabilizing Treatment \nS2.1 Subsequent to the solution anneal required by 6.2, \nGrades 321, 321H, 347, 347H, 348, and 348H shall be given a \nstabilizing treatment at 1500 to 1600 \u00b0F [815 to 870 \u00b0C] for a \nminimum of 2 h/in. [4.7 min/mm] of thickness and then \ncooling in the furnace or in air. In addition to the marking \n682 \nrequired in Section 15, the grade designation symbol shall be \nfollowed by the symbol \"S2.\" \nS3. ASME Section III Construction \nS3.l Products welded with filler metal furnished under this \nspecification that are intended for application under the rules of \nSection III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code shall \nbe manufactured by holders of the appropriate ASME Certifi\u00ad\ncate of Authorization and Certification Mark. The product is \nsubject to all applicable requirements of Section III, including \nwelding, heat treatment, nondestructive examination, autho\u00ad\nrized inspection at the point of manufacture, and application of \nthe Certification Mark.
