Scope \n1.1 This specification covers high-strength quenched and \ntempered alloy steel plates intended for use in fusion welded \nboilers and other pressure vessels. \n1.2 This specification includes a number of grades as \nmanufactured by different producers, but all having the same \nmechanical properties and general characteristics. \n1.3 The maximum thickness of plates furnished under this \nspecification shall be as follows: \nGrade Thickness \nA, B 1.25 in. [32 mm] \nH, S 2 in. [50 mm] \np 4 in. [100 mm] \nF 2.50 in. [65 mm] \nE, Q 6 in. [150 mm] \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system is to \nbe used independently of the other without combining values in \nany way. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \n876 \nA20/A20M Specification for General Requirements for Steel \nPlates for Pressure Vessels \nA435/A435M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic \nExamination of Steel Plates \nA577/A577M Specification for Ultrasonic Angle-Beam Ex\u00ad\namination of Steel Plates \nA578/A578M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic \nExamination of Rolled Steel Plates for Special Applica\u00ad\ntions \n3. General Requirements and Ordering Information \n3.1 Plates furnished to this material specification shall \nconform to Specification A20/ A20M. These requirements out\u00ad\nline the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit\u00ad\nted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of \ndefects, marking, loading, and ordering information. \n3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this \nspecification, certain supplementary requirements are available \nwhen additional control, testing, or examination is required to \nmeet end use requirements. \n3.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require\u00ad\nments of this specification shall prevail. \n4. Manufacture \n4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and \nshall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of \nSpecification A20/ A20M. \n5. Heat Treatment \n5.1 Except as allowed by 5.2, the plates shall be heat treated \nby heating to not less than 1650\u00b0F [900\u00b0C], quenching in water \nor oil and tempering at not less than 1150\u00b0F [620\u00b0C]. \n5.2 Plates ordered without the heat treatment specified in \n5. I shall be stress relieved by the manufacturer, and subsequent \nheat treatment of the plates to conform to 5.1 shall be the \nresponsibility of the purchaser. \n6. Chemical Requirements \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements \nshown in Table l unless otherwise modified in accordance with ",
