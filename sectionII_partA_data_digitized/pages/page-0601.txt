ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-352/SA-352M 
this specification. In case of conflict between the requirements 
of this specification and Specification A 703/ A 703M, this 
specification shall prevail. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 The inquiry and order should include or indicate the 
following: 
4.1.1 A description of the casting by pattern number or 
drawing (dimensional tolerances shall be included on the 
casting drawing), 
4.1.2 Grade of steel, 
4.1.3 Options in the specification, and 
4.1.4 The supplementary requirements desired, including 
the standards of acceptance. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 All castings shall receive a heat treatment proper to their 
design and chemical composition. It should be recognized that 
liquid quenching of the forritic grades is normally required to 
meet the mechanical properties of heavier sections and will 
greatly enhance the low-temperature properties of thinner 
sections. 
5.2 Fe1Titic castings shall be furnished in the normalized and 
tempered or liquid-quenched and tempered condition, except 
for Grade LC9, which shall be liquid-quenched and tempered. 
Castings shall be tempered at a minimum of 1100°F [590°C], 
except Grade LC4, which shall be 1050°F [565°C], and Grade 
LC9, which shall be tempered in the range of 1050 to ll 75°F 
[565 to 635°C], followed by cooling in air or liquid. 
5.3 CA6NM castings shall be heat-treated by heating to 
1850°F [1010°C] minimum, and air cooling to 200°F [95°C] 
maximum before any optional intermediate temper, but shall 
cool to 100°F [40°C] maximum before the final temper, which 
shall be between 1050 and 1150°F [565 and 620°C). 
5.4 Castings shall be allowed to cool below the transforma­
tion range directly after pouring and solidification before they 
are reheated for normalizing or liquid quenching. 
5.5 Temperature Control---Fumace temperature for heat 
treating shall be controlled by use of pyrometers. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition for the grade ordered as specified in 
Table 1. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7.1 Tension Test: 
7 .1.1 Tensile properties of steel used for the castings shall 
confonn to the requirements specified in Table 1. 
7.2 Impact Test: 
7 .2.1 The notched bar impact properties of the material shall 
be determined by testing a set of three Charpy V-notch impact 
specimens for each heat at one of the standard test temperatures 
shown in Table 1, depending on the intended service tempera­
ture (see Appendix XI). The average energy value of the three 
specimens shall not be less than specified, with not more than 
549 
one value permitted below the average minimum specified and 
no value permitted below the minimum specified for a single 
specimen. 
7.2.2 The notched bar impact test shall be made in accor­
dance with Test Methods and Definitions A370. 
7.2.3 Impact test specimens shall be machined to the form 
and dimensions shown in Test Methods and Definitions A370, 
Fig. 11. 
8. Quality 
8.1 The surface of the casting shall be examined visually 
and shall be free of adhering sand, scale, cracks, and hot tears. 
Other surface discontinuities shall meet the visual acceptance 
standards specified in the order. Visual Method SP-55 or other 
visual standards may be used to define acceptable surface 
discontinuities and finish. Unacceptable visual surface discon­
tinuities shall be removed and their removal verified by visual 
examination of the resultant cavities. When methods involving 
high temperature are used in the removal of discontinuities, 
castings shall be preheated to at least the minimum tempera­
tures in Table 2. 
8.2 When additional inspection is desired, Supplementary 
Requirements S4, S5, and SlO, may be ordered. 
8.3 The castings shall not be peened, plugged, or impreg­
nated to stop leaks. 
9. Repair by Welding 
9.1 Repairs shall be made using procedures and welders in 
accordance with Practice A488/ A488M. 
9.2 Welding of Grade LC9 shall be accomplished using 
nonmagnetic filler material of AWS classification ENiCrFe-2, 
and shall require liquid penetrant inspection of the weld 
(Supplementary Requirement S6) when magnetic particle in­
spection (Supplementary Requirement S4) is specified for the 
casting. 
9.3 Weld repairs shall. be inspected to the same quality 
standards that are used to inspect the castings. When castings 
are produced with Supplementary Requirement S4 specified, 
weld repairs shall be inspected by magnetic particle examina­
tion to the same standards that are used to inspect the castings. 
When castings are produced with Supplementary Requirement 
S5 specified, weld repairs on castings that have leaked on 
hydrostatic tests, or on castings in which the depth of any 
cavity prepared for repair welding exceeds 20 % of the wall 
thickness or 1 in. [25 mm] whichever is smaller, or on castings 
in which any cavity prepared for welding is greater than 
approximately 10 in.2 [65 cm 2 shall be radiographed to the 
same standards that are used to inspect the castings. 
9.4 Castings containing any repair weld that exceeds 20 % 
of the wall thickness, or 1 in. [25 mm], whichever is smaller, 
or that exceeds approximately 10 in. 2 [65 cm 2 J in area, or that 
was made to correct hydrostatic test defects shall be stress 
relieved or heat treated after welding. This mandatory stress 
relief or heat treatment shall be in accordance with the 
procedure qualification used. When stress relief is required for 
Grade LC9, cooling shall be in still air.
