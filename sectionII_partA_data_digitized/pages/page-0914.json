Scope \n1.1 This specification covers general requirements that \nshall apply to wrought stainless steel bars, shapes, forgings, \nand billets or other semi-finished material (except wire) for \nforging, under each of the following specifications issued by \nASTM: Specifications A276/A276M, A314, A458, A477, \nA479/A479M, A564/A564M, A565/A565M, A582/A582M, \nA638/A638M, A705/A705M, and A831/A831M. \n1.2 In the case of conflict between a requirement of a \nproduct specification and a requirement of this specification, \nthe product specification shall prevail. In the case of conflict \nbetween a requirement of the product specification or a \nrequirement of this specification and a more stringent require\u00ad\nment of the purchase order, the purchase order shall prevail. \nThe purchase order requirements shall not take precedence if \nthey, in any way, violate the requirements of the product \nspecification or this specification; for example, by waiving a \ntest requirement or by making a test requirement less stringent. \n1.3 The requirements for introduction of new materials in \nspecifications referencing this specification are given in Annex \nAl. \n1.4 General requirements for flat-rolled stainless steel prod\u00ad\nucts other than bar are covered in Specification A480/ A480M. \n1.5 General requirements for wire products in coils are \ncovered in Specification A555/A555M. \n1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to \nensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be \nused independently of the other, and values from the two \nsystems shall not be combined \n1.7 Unless the order specifies an \"M\" designation, the \nmaterial shall be furnished to inch-pound units. \n1.8 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
