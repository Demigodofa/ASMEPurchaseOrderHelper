Scope \n1.1 This specification covers regular and special-quality \nalloy steel bolting materials and bolting components that may \nbe used for nuclear and other special applications. See Speci\u00ad\nfication A962/ A962M for the definition of bolting. \n1.2 The following referenced common requirements are \nindispensable for application of this specification: Specification \nA962/ A962M. \n1.3 Supplementary requirements of an optional nature are \nprovided for use at the option of the purchaser. These supple\u00ad\nmentary requirements only apply when specified individually \nby the purchaser in the purchase order or contract. \n1.4 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound units \nand in SI units; however, unless the purchase order or contract \nspecifies the applicable \"M' specification designation (SI \nunits), inch-pound units shall apply. \n1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. \n1.6 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA962/ A962M Specification for Common Requirements for \nBolting Intended for Use at Any Temperature from Cryo\u00ad\ngenic to the Creep Range \nE45 Test Methods for Determining the Inclusion Content of \nSteel \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 The inquiry and orders for bolting material and bolting \ncomponents under this specification shall include the \nfollowing, as required, to describe the desired items ad\u00ad\nequately: \n3.1.1 Grade and Class \n3.1.2 Condition (Section 5), \n3.1.3 Heat treatment (Section 6), \n3.1.4 Supplementary Requirements (Sl to S9), \n3.1.5 Reports required (Section 16), \n3.1.6 End use, and \n3.1.7 Any special requirements. \n3.2 The purchaser is referred to the listed supplementary \nrequirements. \n4. Common Requirements \n4.1 Bolting materials and bolting components supplied to \nthis specification shall conform to the requirements of Speci\u00ad\nfication A962/ A962M. These requirements include test \nmethods, finish, thread dimensions, macro etch, marking, \ncertification, optional supplementary requirements, and others. \nFailure to comply with the requirements of Specification \n-----------------------------A:,~6211\\~M constitutes nonconformance with this specifica-\n912 \ntion. In case of conflict between this specification and Speci\u00ad\nfication A962/ A962M, this specification shall prevail. ",
