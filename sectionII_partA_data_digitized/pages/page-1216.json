  "text": "SA-691/SA-691M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 \nSpecification for \nCarbon and Alloy Steel Pipe, Electric-Fusion-Welded for \nHigh-Pressure Service at High Temperatures \n1. Scope \n1. 1 This specification covers carbon and alloy steel pipe, \nelectric-fusion-welded with filler metal added, fabricated from \npressure-vessel-quality plate of several analyses and strength \nlevels and suitable for high-pressure service at high tempera\u00ad\ntures. Heat treatment may or may not be required to attain the \ndesired mechanical properties or to comply with applicable \ncode requirements. Supplementary requirements are provided \nfor use when additional testing or examination is desired. \n1.2 The specification nominally . covers pipe 16 in. [ 400 \nmm] in outside diameter and larger with wall thicknesses up to \n3 in. [75 mm] inclusive. Pipe having other dimensions may be \nfurnished provided it complies with all other requirements of \nthis specification. \n1.3 Several grades and classes of pipe are provided. \n1.3.1 Grade designates the type of plate used as listed in \nTable 1. \n1.3.2 Class designates the type of heat treatment performed \nin the manufacture of the pipe, whether the weld is radio\u00ad\ngraphically examined, and whether the pipe has been pressure \ntested as listed in 1.3.3. \n1.3.3 Class designations are as follows (Note 1): \nRadiography, Pressure Test, \nClass Heat Treatment on Pipe see Section see Section \n10 none none none \n11 none 9 none \n12 none 9 8.3 \n13 none none 8.3 \n20 stress relieved, see 5.3.1 none none \n21 stress relieved, see 5.3.1 9 none \n22 stress relieved, see 5.3.1 9 8.3 \n23 stress relieved, see 5.3.1 none 8.3 \n30 normalized, see 5.3.2 none none \n31 normalized, see 5.3.2 9 none \n32 normalized, see 5.3.2 9 8.3 \n33 normalized, see 5.3.2 none 8.3 \n40 normalized and tempered, see 5.3.3 none none \n41 normalized and tempered, see 5.3.3 9 none \n42 normalized and tempered, see 5.3.3 9 8.3 \n43 normalized and tempered, see 5.3.3 none 8.3 \n50 quenched and tempered, see 5.3.4 none none \n51 quenched and tempered, see 5.3.4 9 none \n52 quenched and tempered, see 5.3.4 9 8.3 \n53 quenched and tempered, see 5.3.4 none 8.3 \nNoTE I-Selection of materials should be made with attention to \ntemperature of service. For such guidance, Specification A20/ A20M may \nbe consulted. \n1 .4 Optional requirements of a supplementary nature are \nprovided, calling for additional tests and control of repair \nwelding, when desired. \n1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \n1130 ",
