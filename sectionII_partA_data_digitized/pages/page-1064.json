For smaller quantities A 194 Gr. 2H nuts should be considered. \n(BJ \"Recommended\" denotes a commercially available nut having the most suitable mechanical properties and dimensional configuration (style) \nthat will make it possible to torque the bolt to the required load when used in combination with the nut. \n(Cl \"Suitable\" denotes nuts having mechanical properties that will make it possible to torque the bolt to the required load when used in combination \nwith the nut; but, which require consideration of dimensional configuration (style) suitability and availability. Others are not suitable. \n(DJ The term \"bolt\" includes all externally threaded types of fasteners. \n(El Non-zinc-coated nuts are nuts intended for use with externally threaded fasteners which have a plain (nonplated or noncoated) finish or have \na plating or coating of insufficient thickness to necessitate overlapping the nut thread to provide assemblability. Zinc-coated nuts are nuts \nintended for use with externally threaded fasteners which are hot-dip zinc-coated, mechanically zinc-coated, or have a plating or coating of \nsufficient thickness to necessitate overlapping the nut thread to provide assemblability. \n(Fl Hex nuts in nominal sizes over 1 1/2 to 2 in. inclusive are not covered in the tables of tabulated sizes in ANSI BlB.2.2 but are commercially \navailable. Such nuts are suitable. See 7.2 for dimensions. \n964 ",
