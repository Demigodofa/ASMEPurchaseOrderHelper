Scope \n1. 1 This specification covers high-tensile strength carbon\u00ad\nmanganese steel plates intended for welded pressure vessels. \n1.2 This steel is usually made to a semi-killed or capped \ndeoxidation practice; however, at the purchaser's or the steel \nproducer's option, the steel may be made silicon-killed or \naluminum-killed. \n1.3 The maximum thickness of plates furnished under this \nspecification shall be\u00be in. [20 mm]. \n1.4 For plates produced from coil and furnished without \nheat treatment or with stress relieving only, the additional \nrequirements, including additional testing requirements and the \nreporting of additional test results, of Specification A20/ A20M \napply. \n1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must \nbe used independently of the other. Combining values from the \ntwo systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi\u00ad\ncation. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA20/ A20M Specification for General Requirements for Steel \nPlates for Pressure Vessels \n3. General Requirements and Ordering Information \n3.1 Material supplied to this material specification shall \nconform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out-\nline tl1e testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit\u00ad\nted variations in dimensions, and mass, quality and repair of \ndefects, marking, loading, and ordering information. \n3.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this \nspecification, certain supplementary requirements are available \nwhen additional control, testing, or examination is required to \nmeet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the \nlisted supplementary requirements in this specification and to \nthe detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. \n3.3 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica\u00ad\ntion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates \nproduced from coil means plates that have been cut to \nindividual lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or \nis responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of \ncoils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, \nleveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, \nheat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for \nshipment, and certification. \nNoTE 1-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat \ntreatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are reported for \neach qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plates from coil \nare described in Specification A20/A20M. \n3.4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require\u00ad\nments of this specification shall prevail. \n4. Heat Treatment \n4.1 Plates are normally supplied in the as-rolled condition. \nThe plates may be ordered normalized or stress relieved, or \nboth. \n764 \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements \ngiven in Table 1. \n6. Mechanical Properties \n6.1 Tension Test-The plates, as represented by the tension \ntest specimens, shall conform to the requirements given in \nTable 2. \n7. Keywords \n7.1 carbon steel; high-strength steel plate for pressure pur\u00ad\nposes; welded pressure vessels ",
