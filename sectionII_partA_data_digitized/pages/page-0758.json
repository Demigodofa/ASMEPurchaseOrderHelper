Scope \n1.1 This specification covers minimum-wall-thickness, \nlow-alloy steel tubes for pressure containing parts such as \neconomizers or other applications where corrosion resistance is \nimportant. \n1.2 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to \nthis specification are \u00bd to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside \ndiameter and 0.035 to 0.500 in. [0.9 to 12.7 mm] inclusive, in \nminimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may \nbe furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other \nrequirements of this specification. \n1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to \ntubing smaller than \u00bc in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 \nin. [0.4 mm] in thickness. \n1.4 This specification covers three grades, two types, and \ntwo manufacture finishes: \n1.4.1 Grades 1, 2, and 3 are identified in Table 1 (Chemical \nRequirements), and Table 3 (Tensile Requirements), \n1.4.2 Type (seamless or electric-resistance welded), \n1.4.3 Manufacture (hot finished or cold finished). \n1.5 Optional supplementary requirements S 1 and S2 are \nprovided and, when desired, shall be so stated in the order. \n1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \n1.7 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom-\n708 \nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA450/ A450M Specification for General Requirements for \nCarbon and Low Alloy Steel Tubes \nE213 Practice for Ultrasonic Testing of Metal Pipe and \nTubing \nE273 Practice for Ultrasonic Testing of the Weld Zone of \nWelded Pipe and Tubing \n3. Ordering Information \n3. l Orders for material under this specification shall include \nthe following, as required, to describe the desired material \nadequately: \n3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), \n3.1.2 Type of material (seamless or electric-resistance-\nwelded tubes), \n3.1.3 Grade 1, 2, or 3 (Table 1 and Table 3), \n3.1.4 Manufacture (hot finished or cold finished), \n3.1.5 Size (outside diameter and minimum wall thickness), \n3.1.6 Length (specific or random), \n3.1.7 Required test options (hydrostatic or electric test, \n11.7), \n3 .1. 8 Test report required ( see Certification Section of \nSpecification A450/ A450M), \n3.1.9 Specification designation (including year of issue), \nand \n3.1.10 Special requirements and any supplementary require\u00ad\nments selected. \n4. Manufacture \n4.1 Tubes made by the seamless process may be hot finished \nor cold finished. \nS. Heat Treatment \n5.1 All tubes shall be normalized or given such heat \ntreatment as may be necessary to conform to the requirements \nof this specification. ",
