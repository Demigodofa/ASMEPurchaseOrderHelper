3. Terminology 
3.1 Definitions-For definitions of other terms used in this 
specification, refer to Specification A961/A961M. 
3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.2.1 heaviest cross-section, n-maximum heat treated 
thickness of the production forging. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 See Specification A961/A961M. 
4.1.1 Additional requirements (see 14.2). 
5. General Requirements 
5.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A961/A961M, including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase 
order. Failure to comply with the requirements of Specification 
A961/A961M constitutes nonconformance with this specifica­
tion. In case of a conflict between the requirements of this 
specification and Specification A961/A961M, this specification 
shall prevail. 
5.2 Except as permitted by Section 6 in Specification 
A961/A961M, the finished product shall be a forging as 
defined in the Terminology Section of Specification A788/ 
A788M. 
6. Heat Treatment 
6.1 Heat treatment is not a mandatory requirement of this 
specification except for the following piping components: 
6.1.1 Flanges above Class 300, 
6.1.2 Flanges of special design where the design pressure at 
the design temperature exceeds the pressure-temperature rat­
ings of Class 300, Group 1.1, 
6.1.3 Flanges of special design where the design pressure or 
design temperature are not known,

6.1.4 Piping components other than flanges which meet 
both of the following criteria: (/) over NPS 4 and (2). above 
Class 300, and 
6.1.5 Piping components of Special Class other than 
flanges which meet both of the following criteria: (/) over NPS 
4 and (2) when the working pressure at the operating tempera­
ture exceeds the tabulated values for Special Class 300, Group 
1.1. 
6.2 Heat treatment, when required by 6.1 shall be annealing, 
normalizing, or normalizing and tempering or quenching and 
tempering in accordance with Specification A961/A961M. 
After hot working and before reheating for heat treatment, the 
forging shall be allowed to cool substantially below the 
transformation range. 
6.2.1 Quenching shall consist of either ( 1) fully austenitiz­
ing the forgings followed by quenching in a suitable liquid 
medium or (2) using a multiple stage procedure whereby the 
forgings are first fully austenitized and rapidly cooled, then 
reheated to partially reaustenitize, followed by quenching in a 
suitable liquid medium. All quenched forgings shall be tem­
pered as prescribed in Specification A961/A961M. 
7. Chemical Composition 
7 .1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements 
specified in Table 1. 
7 .2 Steels to which lead has been added shall not be used. 
8. Mechanical Properties 
8.1 The material shall conform to the mechanical property 
requirements prescribed in Table 2 and Table 3. 
8.2 For normalized, normalized and tempered, or quenched 
and tempered forgings, the central axis of the test specimen 
shall be taken at least ¼ T from the nearest surface as-heat­
treated, where Tis the maximum heat-treated thickness of the 
represented forging. In addition, for quenched and tempered 
forgings, the midlength of the test specimen shall be at least T 
from all other surfaces as-heat-treated, exclusive of the T 
dimension surfaces. When section thickness does not permit
