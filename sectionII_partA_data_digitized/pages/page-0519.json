They are not intended as absolute limits beyond which \nbolting materials could no longer be certified to the specification. \n~ 8 To meet the tensile requirements, the Brinell hardness shall not be less than 200 HBW or 93 HRB. \nc Class 1 products are made from solution-treated material. Class 1 A products are solution treated in the finished condition for corrosion resistance; heat treatment is critical for enhancing this physical property and meeting w \nthe mechanical property requirements. Class 2 products are made from solution-treated material that has been strain hardened. Austenitic steels in the strain-hardened condition may not show uniform properties N \n0 \nthroughout the cross section, particularly in sizes over \u00be in. [20 mm] in diameter. \n----\nVl \n\u00b0 For sizes\u00be in. [20 mm] in diameter and smaller, a maximum hardness of 241 HBW (100 HRB) is permitted. > w \nN \n0 \n3: ",
