7. Mechanical Requirements 
7.1 Tension Tests: 
7 .1.1 Requirements-The plates as represented by the 
tension-test specimens shall conform to the requirements given 
in Table 2. 
7.1.2 Test Methods: 
7.1.2.1 The yield strength may be determined by the 0.2 % 
offset method or by the total extension under load of 0.5 % 
method. 
7.1.2.2 For plates 3/'4 in. [20 nun] and under in thickness, the 
test specimen shall be the 1 ½ in. [40 mm] wide rectangular-test 
specimen. 
7.1.2.3 For plates over ¾ in. [20 mm], either the full 
thickness rectangular-test specimen or the ½ in. [12.5 mm] 
round-test specimen may be used. 
Over 2.50 to 6 in. [65 to 150 mm] 
105-135 [725-930] 
90 [620]

45 
7 .1.2.4 When the 1 ½ in. [ 40 mm] wide rectangular-test 
specimen is used, the elongation is measured in a 2 in. or [50 
mm] gage length which includes the fracture. 
7 .2 Impact Properties Requirements: 
7 .2.1 Transverse Charpy V-notch impact test specimens 
shall have a lateral expansion opposite the notch of not less 
than 0,015 in. [0.38 mm]. 
7.2.2 The test temperature shall be agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser, but shall not be higher than 
32°F [0°C]. 
8. Keywords 
8.1 alloy steel; boilers; high-strength; impact tested; plates; 
pressure vessels; quenched; tempered 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
Supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the order. 
A list of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser are included 
in Specification A20/A20M. Several of those considered suitable for use with this specification are 
listed by title. Other tests may be performed by agreement between the supplier and the purchaser.
