General Requirements for Delivery \n7.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con\u00ad\nform to the applicable requirements of the current edition of \nSpecification A568/A568M or Specification A635/A635M un\u00ad\nless otherwise provided herein. \n8. Workmanship \n8.1 The material shall be free from injurious defects (see \nSpecifications A568/A568M or A635/A635M, as appropriate \ndue to thickness). \n9. Finish and Appearance \n9.1 Surface Finish: \n9 .1.1 Unless otherwise specified, the material shall be fur\u00ad\nnished without removing the hot-rolled oxide or scale. \n9.1.2 When required, the material may be specified to be \npickled or blast cleaned. \n9.2 Oiling: \n9.2.1 Unless otherwise specified, the material shall be fur\u00ad\nnished not oiled. \n9.2.2 When specified to be pickled or blast cleaned, the \nmaterial shall be furnished oiled. When required, pickled or \nblast-cleaned material may be specified to be furnished dry. \n9.3 Edges-Unless otherwise specified, mill edges shall be \nfurnished on material that has not had the hot-rolled oxide or \nscale removed and cut edges shall be furnished on material that \nhas had the hot-rolled oxide or scale removed. \n10. Certification and Reports \n10.1 The manufacturer or processor shall furnish copies of a \ntest report showing the results of the heat analysis and \nmechanical property tests made to deternrine compliance with \nthis specification. \n10.2 The report shall include the purchase order number, the \nspecification number and year date, product designation, grade, \nthe heat number, and heat analysis and mechanical properties \nas indicated by the tension test. \n10.2.1 All the mechanical properties from the coil used to \nqualify the lot and the middle test from the particular coil shall \nbe reported along with the coil identification for that coil.
