Plates pro\u00ad\nduced from coil means plates that have been cut to individual \nlengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or is \nresponsible for, the operations involved in the processing of \ncoils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, \nleveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, \nheat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for \nshipment, and certification. \nNoTE 2-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat \ntreatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are rep01ted for \neach qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plate produced \nfrom coil are described in Specification A20/A20M. \n3 .4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require\u00ad\nments of this specification shall prevail. \n4. Heat Treatment \n4.1 Plates are normally supplied in the as-rolled condition. \nThe plates may be ordered normalized or stress relieved, or \nboth. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to \nchemical composition as given in Table l. \n6. Mechanical Properties \n6. l Tension Test-The plates, as represented by the tension \ntest specimens, shall conform to the requirements given in \nTable 2. \n7. Keywords \n7.1 carbon steel plate; low-and-intermediate strength steel \nplate for pressure vessels; steel plate for pressure vessels \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nSupplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the purchase order. \nA list of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser is included \nin Specification A20/A20M.
