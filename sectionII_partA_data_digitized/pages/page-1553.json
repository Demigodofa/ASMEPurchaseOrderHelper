The adverse effects of \ninclusions are minimized by reducing the content of inclusions \nin the steel or by altering the shape of inclusions, or both, \nthrough the use of additions during the steelmaking process \nthat change the elongated shape of the inclusions to less \nharmful small, well dispersed globular inclusions. \n3.2.5 Required Hardness Steel (RHS), n-steel that adheres \nto a specified hardness range, at the time of shipment; may also \nbe referenced as Specified Hardness Steel. \n3.2.5.1 Discussion-Chemical composition shall be deter\u00ad\nmined by the producer unless there is prior agreement between \nproducer and user, or seller and buyer. \n3.2.6 Solid-solution Hardened Steel or Solution Hardened \nSteel (SHS), n-steel strengthened through additions of \nelements, such as Mn, P, or Si, that can be dissolved within the \ncrystalline structure of steels. \n3.2.6.1 Discussion-Alloying elements that form a solid\u00ad\nsolution with iron provide strengthening as a result of local \ndistortions in atomic arrangements, which arise as a result of \nthe mismatch between the atomic sizes of such elements and \nthat of iron. \n3.2.7 Special Forming Steel (SFS), n-steel ordered to 1010 \nchemistry or greater levels of carbon, manganese or both, \nwhich exhibits enhanced formability or mechanical properties. \n3.2.7.1 Discussion-Steel grades such as CS -1010 or CS -\n1020 for example, adhere to chemistry requirements only, \nwhereas SFS - 1010 or SFS - 1020, also provide enhanced \nformability. Due to greater carbon content, SFS - 1020 is not \nas formable as SFS - 1010. \n3.2.8 stabilization, n-addition of one or more nitride- or \ncarbide-forming elements, or both, such as titanium and \ncolumbium, to control the level of the interstitial elements of \ncarbon and nitrogen in the steel. \n3.2.8.1 Discussion-Stabilizing improves formability and \nincreases resistance to aging. \n3.2.9 vacuum degassing, n-process of refining liquid steel \nin which the liquid is exposed to a vacuum as part of a special \ntechnique for removing impurities or for decarburizing the \nsteel. \n4. Classification \n4.1 Cold-rolled steel sheet is available in the following \ndesignations: \n4.1.1 Commercial Steel (CS Types A, B, and C). \n4.1.2 Commercial Steel (CS Types A and B combined with \nchemistry grade in accordance with Specification A568/ \nA568M Table X2.3. \n4.1.3 Drawing Steel (DS Types A and B, as specified in \nTable 1). \n4.1.4 Drawing Steel (DS Type A and B combined with \nchemistry grade in accordance with Specification A568/ \nA568M Table X2.3. \n4.1.5 Commercial Steel Chemistry grade in accordance with \nSpecification A568/A568M Table X2.l, with no type specified \n(CS - 1005, CS - 1008, CS - 1020, and so forth). \n4.1.6 Special Forming Steel (SFS), chemistry as specified in \nTable 1 with carbon and manganese limits in accordance with \nSpecification A568/A568M Tables X2.l or X2.2 (examples: \nSFS - 1010, SFS - 1020, SFS - C 0.12 % to 0.18 % and Mn \n0.50 % to 0.80 % ). \n4.1.7 Deep Drawing Steel (DDS). \n4.1.8 Extra Deep Drawing Steel (EDDS). \n4.1.9 Structural Steel (SS Grades 25 [170], 30 [205], 33 \n[230] Types 1 and 2, 40 [275] Types 1 and 2, 45 [310], 50 \n[340], 60 [410], 70 [480], and 80 [550]). \nTABLE 1 Chemical Composition for Cold Rolled Steel Sheet Designations CS, DS, DDS, EDDS, and SFS \n% Heat Analysis, Element Maximum Unless Otherwise Shown \nDesignation C Mn p s Al Si Cu Ni CrA Mo V Cb/Nb 8 Ti N \ncs Type Ac,o,E,F 0,10 0,60 0,025 0.035 G G 0.20R 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 G \nCS Type sc 0.02-0.15 0.60 0.025 0.035 G G 0.20H 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 G \ncs Type cc,O,E,F 0.08 0.60 0.10 0.035 G G 0.20H 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 G \nDS TypeA 0 \u20221 0.08 0.50 0.020 0.020 0.01 min G 0.20 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 G \nDS Type B 0.02-0.08 0.50 0.020 0.020 0.02 min G 0.20 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 G \noosE,F 0.06 0.50 0.020 0.020 0.01 min G 0.20 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 G \nEDDSJ 0.02 0.40 0.020 0.020 0.01 min G 0.10 0.10 0.15 0.03 0.10 0.10 0.15 G \nSFS K K 0.020 0.020 0.01 min G 0.20 0.20 0.15 0.06 0.008 0.008 0.025 G \nA Chromium is permitted, at the producer's option, to 0.25 % maximum when the carbon content is less than or equal to 0.05 %. \n8 Columbium (Cb) and niobium (Nb) are considered interchangeable names for Element 41 in the periodic table and both names are acceptable for use. \n0 When an aluminum deoxidized steel is required for the application, it is permissible to order Commercial Steel (CS) to a minimum of 0.01 % total aluminum. \n0 Specify Type B to avoid carbon levels below 0.02 %. \nE It is permissible to furnish as a vacuum degassed or chemically stabilized steel, or both, at the producer's option. \nB \nG \nG \nG \nG \nG \nG \nG \nG \nF For carbon levels less than or equal to 0.02 %, it is permissible to use vanadium, columbium or titanium, or a combination thereof, as stabilizing elements at the producer's \noption.
