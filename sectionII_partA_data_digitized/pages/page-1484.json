Scope \n1.1 This specification covers austenitic stainless steel forg\u00ad\nings for boilers, pressure vessels, high temperature parts, and \nassociated equipment. \n1.2 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when \nadditional testing, inspection, or processing is required. In \naddition, supplementary requirements from Specification \nA788/A788M may be specified when appropriate. \n1.3 This specification includes the austenitic steel forgings \nthat were a part of Specification A336/A336M. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to \nensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be \nused independently of the other, and values from the two \nsystems shall not be combined. \n1.5 Unless the order specifies the applicable \"M\" specifica\u00ad\ntion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch\u00ad\npound units. \n1.6 This standard does not purport to address all of the \nsafety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the \nresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro\u00ad\npriate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter\u00ad\nmine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. \n1.7 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
