listed Supplementary requirements in this specification and to 
the detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. 
3.3 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica­
tion until they are processed into finished plate. Plates pro­
duced from coil means plates that have been cut to individual 
lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or is 
responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of 
coils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, 
leveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, 
heat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for 
shipment, and certification. 
NoTE 2-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat 
treatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are rep01ted for 
each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plate produced 
from coil are described in Specification A20/A20M. 
3 .4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict 
with the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require­
ments of this specification shall prevail. 
4. Heat Treatment 
4.1 Plates are normally supplied in the as-rolled condition. 
The plates may be ordered normalized or stress relieved, or 
both. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition as given in Table l. 
6. Mechanical Properties 
6. l Tension Test-The plates, as represented by the tension 
test specimens, shall conform to the requirements given in 
Table 2. 
7. Keywords 
7.1 carbon steel plate; low-and-intermediate strength steel 
plate for pressure vessels; steel plate for pressure vessels 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
Supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the purchase order. 
A list of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser is included 
in Specification A20/A20M. Those that are considered suitable for use with this specification are listed 
below by title.
