mm], whichever is greater. For welded tubing the notch shall 
be placed in the weld, if visible. 
SS.4 For flux leakage testing, each of the longitudinal 
calibration notches shall be a straight sided notch not over 
12½ % of the wall thickness in depth and not over 1.0 in. [25 
mm] in length. Both outside diameter and inside diameter 
notches shall be placed in the tube located sufficiently apart to 
enable separation and identification of the signals. 
S8.5 Tubing producing a signal equal to or greater than the 
calibration defect shall be subject to rejection. The area 
producing the signal may be examined. 
S8.5.1 Test signals produced by imperfections which cannot 
be identified, or produced by cracks or crack-like defects shall 
result in rejection of the tube subject to rework and retest. 
S8.5.2 Test signals produced by imperfections such as those 
listed below may be judged as injurious or noninjurious 
depending on visual observation of their severity or the type of 
signal they produce on the testing equipment used, or both: 
S8.5.2.1 Dings, 
SS.5.2.2 Straightener marks, 
S8.5.2.3 Loose inside diameter bead and cutting chips, 
SS.5.2.4 Scratches, 
S8.5.2.5 Steel die stamps, 
S8.5.2.6 Chattered flash trim, 
S8.5.2.7 Stop marks, or 
S8.5.2.8 Tube reducer ripple. 
ss-.--53 Any miperfection of the above type exceeding 0.0M 
in. [0.101 mm] or 12Y2 % of the specified wall thickness 
(whichever is greater) in depth shall be considered injurious. 
S8.5.3.1 If the imperfection is judged as injurious, tl1e tubes 
shall be rejected but may be reconditioned and retested 
providing the dimensional requirements are met.

S8.5.3.2 If the imperfection is explored to the extent that it 
can be identified as noninjurious, the tubes may be accepted 
without further test providing the imperfection does not en­
croach on the minimum wall thickness, after due allowance for 
cleanup in mandrel drawn tubes. 
S9. Certification for Government Orders 
S9.l A producer's or supplier's certification shall be fur­
nished to the Government that the material was manufactured, 
sampled, tested, and inspected in accordance with this speci­
fication and has been found to meet the requirements. This 
certificate shall include a report of heat analysis (product 
analysis when requested in the purchase order), and when 
specified in the purchase order or contract, a report of test 
results shall be furnished. 
S10. Rejection Provisions for Government Orclers 
S 10.1 Each length of tubing received from the manufacturer 
may be inspected by the purchaser and, if it does not meet the 
requirements of the specification based on the inspection and 
test method as outlined in the specification, the tube may be 
rejected and the manufacturer shall be notified. Disposition of 
rejected tubing shall be a matter of agreement between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser ... ____ _ 
S 10.2 Material that fails in any of the forming operations or 
in the process of installation and is found to be defective shall 
be set aside and the manufacturer shall be notified for mutual 
evaluation of the material's suitability. Disposition of such 
material shall be a matter for agreement.
