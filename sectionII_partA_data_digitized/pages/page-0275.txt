energy absorption value of 40 ft-lbf [54 J] average of three 
specimens. One specimen only in one set may be below 40 
ft-lbf [54 J], and it shall meet a minimum value of 35 ft-lbf [48 
J]. 
9.7.5 The impact test temperature shall be O °F [-18 °C]. 
10. Grain Size for Austenitic Grades 
10.1 All H grades and grade F 63 shall be tested for average 
grain size by Test Methods El 12. 
10.1.1 Grades F 304H, F 309H, F 310H, and F 316H shall 
have a grain size of ASTM No. 6 or coarser. 
10.1.2 Grades F 321H, F 347H, and F 348H shall have a 
grain size of ASTM No. 7 or coarser. 
10.1.3 Grade F 63 shall have a grain size of ASTM No. 3 or 
finer. 
10.1.4 Annealed Alloys UNS N08810 and UNS N08811 
shall conform to an average grain size of ASTM No. 5 or 
coarser. 
11. Corrosion Testing for Austenitic Grades and 
Detrimental Phase Detection in Austenitic/Ferritic 
Stainless Grades 
11.1 Corrosion testing is not required by this specification 
nor is detrimental phase detection. 
11.2 Austenitic grades shall be capable of meeting the 
intergranular corrosion test requirements described in Supple­
mentary Requirement S4. 
11.3 Austenitic/Ferritic Stainless grades shall be capable of 
meeting the requirements described in Supplementary Require­
ment S 12 if the subject grade is included in the specifications 
listed in Supplementary Requirement Sl2. 
12. Retreatment 
12.1 If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform to 
the requirements specified, the manufacturer may reheat treat 
the forgings and repeat the tests specified in Section 9. 
13. Nondestructive Test Requirements 
13.1 Hollow forgings of Grades F 91 Types 1 and 2, F 92, 
F 115, F 122, and F 911, NPS 4 [DIN 100] and larger, whose 
finished internal surfaces are not accessible to magnetic par­
ticle or liquid penetrant examination, shall be examined by an 
ultrasonic test in accordance with Practice A388/A388M, after 
all forging, mechanical processing, and heat treatment opera­
tions have been completed. 
13.2 Hollow forgings of Grades F 91 Types 1 and 2, F 92, 
F 115, F 122, and F 911, NPS 4 [DIN 100] and larger, whose 
finished internal surfaces are accessible to magnetic particle or 
liquid penetrant examination, shall be examined on their 
internal surfaces by either a magnetic particle test in accor­
dance with Practice A275/A275M, or by a liquid penetrant 
examination in accordance with Test Method E165/El65M, as 
applicable, after all heat treatment, machining, and other 
mechanical processing operations are completed. 
13.3 Time of Examination-Examination by one of the 
methods in 13 .1 or 13 .2, for specification acceptance, shall be 
performed as specified in 13.1 or 13.2. This requirement does 
not preclude additional testing at earlier stages in the process­
ing. 
13.4 Evaluation of Impe,fections Found by Ultrasonic' Ex­
amination: 
13 .4.1 Forgings producing a signal equal to or greater than 
the lowest signal produced by the reference discontinuities 
shall be identified and separated from the acceptable forgings. 
The area producing the signal may be reexamined. 
13.4.2 Such forgings shall be rejected if the test signals were 
produced by impetfections that cannot be identified or were 
produced by cracks or crack-like imperfections. Such forgings 
may be repaired. To be accepted, a repaired forging shall pass 
the same nondestructive test by which it was rejected, and it 
shall meet the minimum wall thickness requirements of this 
specification and the purchase order. 
13.4.3 If the test signals were produced by visual imperfec­
tions such as scratches, surface roughness, dings, tooling 
marks, cutting chips, steel die stamps, or stop marks, the 
forging is permitted to be accepted based upon visual exami­
nation provided that the depth of the imperfection is less than 
0.004 in. [0.1 mm] or 12.5 % of the specified wall thickness, 
whichever is the greater. 
13.5 Treatment of Impe,fections Found by Magnetic Par­
ticle or Liquid Penetrant Examination: 
13.5.1 Defects shall be completely removed prior to weld 
repair by chipping or grinding to sound metal. Removal of 
these defects shall be verified by magnetic particle inspection 
in accordance with Test Method A275/A275M or by liquid 
penetrant inspection in accordance with Test Method E165/ 
E165M. 
13.5.2 Rejected forgings may be reconditioned and retested, 
provided that the wall thickness is not decreased to less than 
that required by this specification and the purchase order. The 
outside diameter at the point of grinding may be reduced by the 
amount so removed. To be accepted, retested forgings shall 
meet the test requirement.
