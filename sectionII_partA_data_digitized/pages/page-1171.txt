5. Heat Treatment 
5 .1 All plates of Grade A and plates of Grades B and C over 
1 ½ in. [40 mm] in thickness shall be nonnalized. 
5-2 Plates of Grades Band C, 1 V2 in. [40 mm] and under in 
thickness, are normally supplied in the as-rolled condition. The 
plates may be ordered normalized or stress relieved, or both.

6.1 The steel shall confonn to the requirements as to 
chemical composition given in Table 1 unless otherwise 
modified in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S17, 
Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized Steel, in Specification A20/ 
A20M. 
7. Mechanical Requirements 
7 .1 Tension Test Requirements-The plates, as represented 
by the tension test specimens, shall conform to the require­
ments given in Table 2. 
8. Keywords 
8.1 carbon steel; carbon steel plate; pressure contammg 
parts; pressure vessel steels; steel plates for pressure vessels
