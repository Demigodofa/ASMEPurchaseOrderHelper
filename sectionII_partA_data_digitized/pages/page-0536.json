Scope \n1.1 This specification covers nominal (average) wall seam\u00ad\nless and welded carbon and alloy steel pipe intended for use at \nlow temperatures and in other applications requiting notch \ntoughness. Several grades of fenitic steel are included as listed \nin Table l . Some product sizes may not be available under this \nspecification because heavier wall thicknesses have an adverse \neffect on impact properties. \n1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \nNoTE 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has \nbeen substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as \"nominal \ndiaineter,\" \"size,\" and \"nominal size.\" \n2.
