Retests \n15.1 If the results of the mechanical tests of any group or lot \ndo not conform to the requirements specified in the individual \nspecification, retests may be made on additional tubes of \ndouble the original number from the same group or lot, each of \nwhich shall conform to the requirements specified. \n16. Reheat Treatment \n16.1 If the individual tubes or the tubes selected to represent \nany group or lot fail to conform to the test requirements, the \nindividual tubes or the group or lot represented may be reheat \ntreated and resubmitted for test. Not more than two reheat \ntreatments shall be permitted. \n17. Test Specimens \n17 .1 Test specimens shall be taken from the ends of finished \ntubes prior to upsetting, swaging, expanding, or other fanning \noperations, or being cut to length. They shall be smooth on the \nends and free of bmTs and flaws. \n17 .2 If any test specimen shows flaws or defective \nmachining, it may be discarded and another specimen substi\u00ad\ntuted. \n18. Method of Mechanical Testing \n18. l The specimens and mechanical tests required shall be \nmade in accordance with Test Methods and Definitions A370 \nor Test Methods A1058. \n18.1.1 Unless otherwise specified in the ordering \nrequirements, Test Methods AI058 shall apply when the metric \nversion of the product specification is specified. \n18.2 Specimens shall be tested at room temperature. \n18.3 Small or subsize specimens as described in Test \nMethods and Definitions A370 or Test Methods A1058 may be \nused only when there is insufficient material to prepare one of \nthe standard specimens. When using small or subsize \nspecimens, the largest one possible shall be used. \n19. Flattening Test \n19.1 A section of tube not less than 2\u00bd in. [60 mm] in \nlength for seamless tubes and not less than 4 in. [IO0 mm] in \nlength for welded tubes and for heavily cold-worked tubes \nshall be flattened cold between parallel plates in two steps. For \nwelded tubes, the weld shall be placed 90\u00b0 from the direction \nof the applied force (at a point of maximum bending). During \nthe first step, which is a test for ductility, no cracks or breaks, \nexcept as provided for in 19.4, on the inside, outside, or end \nsmfaces shall occur in seamless tubes, or on the inside or \noutside surfaces of welded tubes and heavily cold-worked \ntubes, until the distance between the plates is less than the \nvalue of H calculated by the following equation: \n(1 +e)t \nH=e+t!D (2) \nwhere: \nH = distance between flattening plates, in. [mm], \n= specified wall thickness of the tube, in. [mm], \nD = specified outside diameter of the tube, in. [mm], and \ne = deformation per unit length ( constant for a given grade \nof steel: 0.07 for medium-carbon steel (maximum \nspecified carbon 0.19 % or greater), 0.08 for ferritic \nalloy steel, 0.09 for austenitic steel, 0.09 for duplex \n(ferritic/austenitic) stainless steels, and 0.09 for low\u00ad\ncarbon steel (maximum specified carbon 0.18 % or \nless)). \nDuring the second step, which is a test for soundness, the \nflattening shall be continued until the specimen breaks or the \nopposite walls of the specimen meet. Evidence of laminated or \nunsound material, or of incomplete weld that is revealed dming \nthe entire flattening test shall be cause for rejection. \n19.2 Surface imperfections in the test specimens before \nflattening, but revealed during the first step of the flattening \ntest, shall be judged in accordance with the finish requirements. \n19.3 Superficial ruptures resulting from surface imperfec\u00ad\ntions shall not be cause for rejection. \n19.4 When low D-to-t ratio tubular products are tested, \nbecause the strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably \nhigh on the inside surface at the six and twelve o'clock \nlocations, cracks at these locations shall not be cause for \nrejection if the D-to-t ratio is less than 10. \n20. Reverse Flattening Test \n20.1 A section 4 in. [100 mm] in length of finished welded \ntubing in sizes down to and including \u00bd in. [12.7 mm] in \noutside diameter shall be split longitudinally 90\u00b0 on each side \nof the weld and the sample opened and flattened with the weld \nat the point of maximum bend. There shall be no evidence of \ncracks or lack of penetration or overlaps resulting from flash \nremoval in the weld. \n21. Reverse Bend Test \n21.1 A section 4 in. [100 mm] minimum in length shall be \nsplit longitudinally 90\u00b0 on each side of the weld. The sanlple \nshall then be opened and bent around a mandrel with a \nmaximum thickness of four times the wall thickness, with the \nmandrel parallel to the weld and against the original outside \nsurface of the tube. The weld shall be at the point of maximum \nbend. There shall be no evidence of cracks or of overlaps \nresulting from the reduction in thickness of the weld area by \ncold working. When the geometry or size of the tubing make it \ndifficult to test the sample as a single piece, the sample may be \nsectioned into smaller pieces provided a minimum of 4 in. of \nweld is subjected to reverse bending. \n21.2 The reverse bend test is not applicable when the wall is \n10 % or more of the specified outside diameter, or the wall \nthickness is 0.134 in. [3.4 mm] or greater, or the outside \ndiameter is less than 0.375 in. [9.5 mm]. Under these \nconditions, the reverse flattening test shall apply. \n22. Flaring Test \n22.1 A section of tube approximately 4 in. [100 mm] in \nlength shall stand being flared with a tool having a 60\u00b0 included \nangle until the tube at the mouth of the flare has been expanded \n1530 ",
