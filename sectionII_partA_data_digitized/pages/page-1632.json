Additional Requirements \n1.1 General Requirements: \nAll \"see EN 10028-1\" shall be read as \"shall be according \nto EN 10028-1.\" \n1.2 Marking: \n(a) In addition to the marking requirements of this \nspecification, all products required to be marked and \nmaterial identification used on all documentation \nrequired by this specification are to be identified by \nthis SA/EN specification designation. \n(b) Plates that have been given the full heat treatment \nrequired by para. 8.2.2 shall be marked by the party \nperforming the heat treatment with the letters designating \nthe applicable heat treatment condition in Table A.1 ofEN \n10028-4 following the stamped steel name or number. \n( c) Plates that are not heat treated but are qualified on \nthe basis of heat treated specimens per para. 8.2.3 shall be \nstamped with letter \"G\" following the stamped specifica\u00ad\ntion designation. \n(d) When such plates are subsequently heat treated, \nthey shall be marked by the party that performed the \nheat treatment, as required by (b) above following the \nrequired stamped specification designation. \n1.3 Chemical Composition: \nThe requirements of paras. 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 on heat \nanalysis, and of paras. 7.2.3 and 7.2.4 on product analysis, \nof SA-20/SA-20M shall apply. \n1.4 Tension Tests: \nFor quenched and tempered plates one tension test \nshall be taken from each end of the heat treated plate. \nThe gage length of the tension test specimens shall be \ntaken at least 1 T from any heat treated edge, where T \nis the thickness of the plate, and shall be at least 1/ 2 in. \n(12.5 mm) from flame cut or heat-affected-zone surfaces. \n1.5 Impact Tests: \n1.5.1 Impact Test Sampling: \nDeviation from the requirement for preparation of test \npieces for impact testing in EN 10028-1 shall not be \npermitted in SA/EN 10028-4. \n1.5.2 The impact test specimens shall be taken from \na location adjacent to the tension test specimens and shall \nbe at least 1 T from any heat treated edge. \n1.6 Steelmaking Process: \nThe ratio of reduction of thickness from a strand-cast \nslab to plate shall be at least 3.0:1. \n1.7 Quality: \n1.7.1 Surface Imperfections \n(a) Shallow imperfections shall be ground to sound \nmetal; the ground area shall be well faired and the thick\u00ad\nness of the ground plate shall not be reduced below the \nminimum thickness permitted. \n1578 \n. ,.---.._ ",
