[2.4 min/mm] of \nthickness, but in no case less than 15 min, and cool in air. \n5.2.2 Second Normalizing Treatment-Reheat the plate to a \nuniform temperature of 1450 \u00b1 25\u00b0F [790 \u00b1 15\u00b0C], hold at \nthat temperature for a minimum of 1 h/in. [2.4 min/mm] of \nthickness, but in no case less than 15 min, and cool in air. \n5.2.3 Tempering Treatment-Reheat the plate to a unifmm \ntemperature within the range from 1050 to 1125\u00b0F [565 to \n605\u00b0C], hold within that temperature range for a minimum of \n1 h/in. [2.4 min/mm] of thickness, but in no case less than 15 \nmin, and cool in air or water quench at a rate not less than \n300\u00b0F/h [165\u00b0C/h]. \n5.2.4 If hot forming is performed after heating to a tempera\u00ad\nture within the range from 1650 to 1750\u00b0F [900 to.955\u00b0C] the \nfirst normalizing treatment (5.2.1) may be omitted. \n5.2.5 When the plates are heat treated by the fabricator, it \nshall be the fabricator's responsibility to apply the proper heat \ntreatment and to conduct tests it deems necessary to ensure that \nthe specified properties are attained. \n6. Chemical Requirements \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical composition \nrequirements shown in Table 1 unless otherwise modified in \naccordance with Supplementary Requirement S 17, Vacuum \nCarbon-Deoxidized Steel, in Specification A20/A20M. \n7. Mechanical Requirements \n7 .1 Tension Test Requirements-The material as represented \nby the tension-test specimens shall conform to the require\u00ad\nments specified in Table 2. \n7.1.1 Upon agreement between the purchaser and the \nmanufacturer, yield strength may be determined by the exten\u00ad\nsion under load method, using 0.005 in.fin. [0.005 mm/mm] \ntotal extension. \n7.1.2 For nominal plate thicknesses of\u00be in. [20 mm] and \nunder, the 1 \u00bd-in. [40-rnrn] wide rectangular specimen may be \nused for the tension test and the elongation may be determined \nin a 2-in. [50-mm] gage length that includes the fracture and \nshows the greatest elongation. \n7 .1.3 One tension test shall be taken from each plate as heat \ntreated. \n7.2 Impact Test Requirements: \n555 \n7 .2.1 Charpy V-notch impact tests shall be made in accor\u00ad\ndance with Specification A20/ A20M. \n7.2.2 The longitudinal axis of the test specimens shall be \ntransverse to the final rolling direction of the plate. \n7.2.3 Unless otherwise agreed, tests shall be conducted at \n-320\u00b0F [-195\u00b0C]. \n7.2.4 Each test specimen shall have a lateral expansion \nopposite the notch of not less than 0.015 in. [0.381 mm]. \n8. Finish \n8.1 Because retained scale may mask surface imperfections, \nas well as mar the plate surface, plates shall be descaled by the \nproducer after heat treatment. In the case of material to be \nheat-treated by the purchaser, the plates shall be descaled by \nthe producer prior to shipment. \n9.
