[1.6 \u00b1 0.8 mm]. Other bevel angles may be \nspecified by agreement between the purchaser and the manu\u00ad\nfacturer. \n20. Sampling \n20.1 For product analysis (see 9.1) and tensile tests (see \n21.1), a lot is the number of lengths of the same size and wall \nthickness from any one heat of steel; of 400 lengths or fraction \nthereof, of each size up to, but not including, NPS 6 [DN 150]; \nand of 200 lengths or fraction thereof of each size NPS 6 [DN \n150] and over. \n20.2 For bend tests (see 21.2), a lot is the number of lengths \nof the same size and wall thickness from any one heat of steel, \nof 400 lengths or fraction thereof, of each size. \n20.3 For flattening tests, a lot is the number of lengths of the \nsame size and wall thickness from any one heat of steel, of 400 \nlengths or fraction thereof of each size over NPS 2 [DN 50], up \nto but not including NPS 6 [DN 150], and of 200 lengths or \nfraction thereof, of each size NPS 6 [DN 150] and over. \n21. Number of Tests \n21.1 The tensile requirements specified in Section 10 shall \nbe determined on one length of pipe from each lot (see 20.1). \n21.2 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] and under, the bend test \nspecified in 11.1 shall be made on one pipe from each lot ( see \n20.2). The bend test, where used as required by 11.2, shall be \nmade on one end of 5 % of the pipe from each lot. For small \nlots, at least one pipe shall be tested. \n21.3 If any test specimen shows flaws or defective \nmachining, it shall be permissible to discard it and substitute \nanother test specimen. \n22. Retests \n22.1 If the percentage of\u00b7 elongation of any tension test \nspecimen is less than that given in Table 1 and any part of the \nfracture is more than \u00be in. [19 mm] from the center of the \ngauge length of a 2-in. [50-mm] specimen as indicated by \nscribe scratches marked on the specimen before testing, a retest \nshall be allowed. If a specimen breaks in an inside or outside \nsurface flaw, a retest shall be allowed. \n23. Test Specimens and Test Methods \n23.1 On NPS 8 [DN 200] and larger, specimens cut either \nlongitudinally or transversely shall be acceptable for the \ntension test. On sizes smaller than NPS 8 [DN 200], the \nlongitudinal test only shall be used. \n23.2 When round tension test specimens are used for pipe \nwall thicknesses over 1.0 in. [25.4 mm], the mid-length of the \nlongitudinal axis of such test specimens shall be from a \nlocation midway between the inside and outside surfaces of the \npipe. \n23 .3 Test specimens for the bend test specified in Section 11 \nand for the flattening tests shall consist of sections cut from a \npipe. Specimens for flattening tests shall be smooth on the ends \nand free from burrs, except when made on crop ends. \n23.4 Test specimens for the bend test specified in 11.2 shall \nbe cut from one end of the pipe and, unless otherwise specified, \nshall be taken in a transverse direction. One test specimen shall \nbe taken as close to the outer surface as possible and another \nfrom as close to the inner surface as possible. The specimens \nshall be either\u00bd by\u00bd in. [12.5 by 12.5 mm] in section or 1 by \n\u00bd in. [25 by 12.5 mm] in section with the corners rounded to \na radius not over 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] and need not exceed 6 in. \n[150 mm] in length. The side of the samples placed in tension \nduring the bend shall be the side closest to the inner and outer \nsurface of the pipe respectively. \n23.5 All routine check tests shall be made at room tempera\u00ad\nture. \n23.6 All tests shall be performed after the heat treatments \npermitted by 5.1 or required by 5.2. \n24. Certification \n24.1 In the required test report(s), in addition to the require\u00ad\nments of Specification A530/A530M, the producer or supplier \nshall furnish to the purchaser a chemical analysis report for the \nelements specified in Table 1. \n25. Product Marking \n25.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification \nA530/A530M, the marking shall include heat number, the \ninformation as per Table 4, an additional symbol \"S\" if one or \nmore of the supplementary requirements apply; the length, OD \n1 %, if ordered as special outside diameter tolerance pipe; ID \n1 %, if ordered as special inside diameter tolerance pipe; the \nschedule number, weight class, or nominal wall thickness; and, \nfor sizes larger than NPS 4 [DN 100], the weight. Length shall \nbe marked in feet and tenths of a foot [metres to two decimal \nplaces], depending on the units to which the material was \nordered, or other marking subject to agreement. For sizes NPS \n1 \u00bd, 1 \u00bc, 1, and\u00be [DN 40, 32, 25, and 20], each length shall \nbe marked as prescribed in Specification A530/A530M. These \nsizes shall be bundled in accordance with standard mill practice \nand the total bundle footage marked on the bundle tag; \nindividual lengths of pipe need not be marked with footage. \nFor sizes less than NPS % [DN 20], all the required markings \nshall be on the bundle tag or on each length of pipe and shall \nTABLE 4 Marking \nHydro NDE Marking \nYes No Test Pressure \nNo Yes NDE \nNo No NH \nYes Yes Test Pressure/NOE \n175 ",
