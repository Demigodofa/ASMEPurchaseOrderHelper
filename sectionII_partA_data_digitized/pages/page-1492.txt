(Identical with ASTM Specification A 985/ A 985M-04a.) 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers a group of common 
requirements that are mandatory for steel castings produced 
by the investment casting process for pressure-containing 
parts under each of the following ASTM Specifications: 
Title of Specification 
Steel Castings, Carbon, Suitable for Fusion 
Welding for High-Temperature Service 
Steel Castings, Martensitic Stainless and Alloy, 
for Pressure-Containing Parts, Suitable for 
High-Temperature Service 
Castings, Austenitic, Austenitic-Ferritic 
(Duplex), for Pressure-Containing Parts 
Steel Castings, Ferritic and Martensitic, for 
Pressure-Containing Parts Suitable for Low­
Temperature Service 
Steel Castings, Alloy, Specially Heat-Treated, 
for Pressure-Containing Parts, Suitable for 
High Temperature Service 
Steel Castings Suitable for Pressure Service

Designation 
A216/A 216M 
A217/A 217M 
A 351/A 351M 
A 352/A 352M 
A 389/A 389M 
A487/A487M 
1.2 This specification also covers a group of supple­
mentary requirements, which may be applied to the above 
specifications as indicated therein. These requirements are 
provided for use when additional testing or inspection is 
desired and apply only when specified individually by the 
purchaser in the order. 
1.3 When investment casting is ordered, the require­
ments of this specification shall take precedence over the 
individual material specification requirements. 
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as the standard. Within the 
text, the SI units are shown in brackets. The values in each 
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
must be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in nonconformance with 
this specification. Inch-pound units are applicable for mate­
rial ordered to Specification A 985 and SI units for material 
ordered to Specification A 985M. 
1.5 This standard does not purport to address all of 
the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is 
the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish 
appropriate safety and health practices and determine the 
applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.
