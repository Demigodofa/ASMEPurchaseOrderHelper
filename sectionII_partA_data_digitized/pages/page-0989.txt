14.2.1 The defect may be removed by grinding provided 
that the remaining wall thickness is within specified limits. 
14.2.2 Repaired in accordance with the repair welding 
provisions of 14.6. 
14.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect may be cut 
off within the limits of requirements on length. 
14.2.4 Rejected. 
14.3 To provide a workmanlike finish and basis for evalu­
ating conformance with 14.2, the pipe manufacturer shall 
remove by grinding the following noninjurious imperfections: 
14.3.1 Mechanical marks, abrasions (Note 5), and pits, any 
of which imperfections are deeper than 1/16 in. (1.58 mm). 
NoTE 5-Marks and abrasions are defined as cable marks, dinges, guide 
marks, roll marks, ball scratches, scores, die marks, and the like. 
14.3.2 Visual imperfections, commonly refetTed to as scabs, 
seams, laps, tears, or slivers, found by exploration in accor­
dance with 14.1 to be deeper than 5 % of the nominal wall 
thickness. 
14.4 At the purchaser's discretion, pipe shall be subject to 
rejection if surface imperfections acceptable under 14.2 are not 
scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is 
considered a workmanlike finish. Disposition of such pipe shall 
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser. 
14.5 When imperfections or defects are removed by 
giinding, a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the 
wall thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by 
this specification. The outside diameter at the point of grinding 
may be reduced by the amount so removed. 
14.5.1 Wall thickness measurements shall be made with a 
mechanical caliper or with a properly calibrated nondestruc­
tive testing device of appropriate accuracy. In case of dispute, 
16. Test Specimens and Methods of Testing 
16.1 Specimens cut either longitudinally or transversely 
shall be acceptable for the tension test. 
16.2 Test specimens for the bend test specified in 9.2 and for 
the flattening tests specified in Section 10 shall consist of 
sections cut from a pipe. Specimens for flattening tests shall be 
smooth on the ends and free from burrs, except when made on 
crop ends. 
16.3 Test specimens for the bend test specified in 9.2.2 shall 
be cut from one end of the pipe and, unless otherwise specified, 
shall be taken in a transverse direction. One test specimen shall 
be taken as close to the outer surface as possible and another 
from as close to the inner surface as possible. The specimens 
shall be either ½ by ½ in. [12.7 mm] in section or 1 by ½ in. 
[25.4 by 12.7 mm] in section with the corners rounded to a 
radius not over 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] and need not exceed 6 in. 
[152 mm] in length. The side of the samples placed in tension 
during the bend shall be the side closest to the inner and outer 
surface of the pipe respectively. 
17. Lengths 
17 .1 Pipe lengths shall be in accordance with the following 
regular practice: 
17 .1.1 The lengths required shall be specified in the order, 
and 
17 .1.2 No jointers are permitted unless otherwise specified. 
17.2 If definite lengths are not required, pipe may be 
ordered in single random lengths of 16 to 22 ft [4.9 to 6.7 m], 
with 5 % 12 to 16 ft [3.7 to 4.9 m], or in double random lengths 
with a minimum average of 35 ft [10.7 m] and a minimum 
length of 22 ft [6.7 m] with 5 % 16 to 22 ft [4.9 to 6.7 m]. 
the measurement determined by use of the mechanical caliper 18. Rejection 
shall govern. 18.1 Each length of pipe that develops injurious defects 
14.6 Weld repair shall be permitted only subject to the during shop working or application operations will be rejected, 
approval of the purchaser and in accordance with Specification and the manufacturer shall be notified. No rejections under this

on one length of pipe from each lot (Note 2). 
15.2 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50) and under, the bend test 
specified in 9.2 shall be made on one pipe from each lot (Note 
2). The bend tests specified in 9.2.2 shall be made on one end 
of each pipe. 
15.3 The flattening test specified in Section 10 shall be 
made on one length of pipe from each lot (Note 2). 
15.4 Retests shall be in accordance with Specification 
A530/A530M and as provided in 15.5 and 15.6. 
15.5 If a specimen breaks in an inside or outside snrface 
flaw, a retest shall be allowed. 
15.6 Should a crop end of a finished pipe fail in the 
flattening test, one retest may be made from the broken end. 
19. Product Marking 
19.1 In addition to the marking prescdbed in Specification 
A530/A530M, the marking shall include the hydrostatic test 
pressure when tested or the letters "NH" when not tested, the 
length and schedule number, and on pipe sizes larger than 
NPS 4 [DN 100] the weight shall be given. Length shall be 
marked in feet and tenths of a foot, or metres to two decimal 
places, depending on the units to which the material was 
ordered, or other marking subject to agreement.

19.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 19.1, 
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification 
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a specific bar 
coding system to be used.
