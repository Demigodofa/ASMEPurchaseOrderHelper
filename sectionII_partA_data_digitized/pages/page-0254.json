Scope \n1. 1 This specification covers minimum-wall-thickness, \nseamless cold-drawn low-carbon steel tubes for tubular heat \nexchangers, condensers, and similar heat transfer apparatus. \n1.2 This specification covers tubes 1/s to 3 in. [3.2 to 76.2 \nmm], inclusive, in outside diameter. \nNoTE I-Tubing smaller in outside diameter and having a thinner wall \nthan indicated in this specification is available. Mechanical property \nrequirements do not apply to tubing smaller than Vs in. [3.2 mm] in outside \ndiameter or with a wall thickness under 0.015 in. [0.4 mm]. \n1.3 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must \nbe used independently of the other. Combining values from the \ntwo systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi\u00ad\ncation. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \n1.4 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA450/A450M Specification for General Requirements for \nCarbon and Low Alloy Steel Tubes \n202 \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for material under this specification should \ninclude the following, as required, to describe the desired \nmaterial adequately: \n3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), \n3.1.2 Name of material (seamless tubes), \n3.1.3 Manufacture (cold-drawn), \n3.1.4 Size (outside diameter and minimum wall thickness), \n3.1.5 Length (specific or random), \n3.1.6 Optional requirements (product analysis, Section 9, \nflange test, 11.3), \n3.1.7 Test report required (Certification Section of Specifi\u00ad\ncation A450/A450M), \n3.1.8 Specification number, and \n3.1.9 Special requirements. \n4. General Requirements \n4.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con\u00ad\nform to the applicable requirements of the current edition of \nSpecification A450/ A450M, unless otherwise provided herein. \n5. Manufacture \n5.1 Tubes shall be made by the seamless process and shall \nbe cold drawn. \n6. Heat Treatment \n6.1 Tubes shall be heat treated after the final cold draw pass \nat a temperature of 1200\u00b0F [650\u00b0C] or higher. \n7. Surface Condition \n7 .1 Finished tubes shall be free of scale. A slight amount of \noxidation will not be considered as scale. \n8. Chemical Composition \n8.1 The steel shall conform to the following requirements as \nto chemical composition: \nCarbon, % 0.06-0.18 \nManganese, % 0.27-0.63 \nPhosphorus, max, % 0.035 \nSulfur, max, % 0.035 \n8.2 Supplying an alloy grade that specifically requires the \naddition of any element other than those listed in 8.1 is not \npermitted.
