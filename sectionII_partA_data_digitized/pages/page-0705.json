Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 The melting method and the nodularizing practice \nshall be optional with the foundry. \n5.2 Except as provided in 5.2.1, all castings Grade \n60-40-18 shall be given a ferritizing heat treatment that \nproduces essentially a ferritic structure that contains no \nmassive carbides. \n5.2.1 When specified in the purchase order, Grade \n60-40-18 castings may be provided in an as-cast condition \nprovided they comply with the requirements of 7 .1 and \n7.2.1. \n5.2.2 Castings supplied in accordance with 5 .2.1 may \nbe stress relieved by agreement between the manufacturer \nand purchaser. \n5.3 Castings Grade 65-45-15 may be provided in as\u00ad\ncast condition or heat treated, provided they comply with \nthe requirements of 7.1, 7.2.2, and 7.3.2. \n6. Chemical Requirements \n6.1 The casting shall conform to the following require\u00ad\nments for chemical composition (Note 2): \nTotal carbon, min, % \nSilicon, max, % \nPhosphorus, max, % \n3.00 \n2.50 \n0.08 \n6.1.1 The chemical analysis for total carbon shall be \nmade on chilled cast pencil type specimens or from thin \nwafers approximately \u00bd 2 in. [0.8 mm] thick cut from test \ncoupons. Drillings are not reliable because of the probable \nloss of graphite. \n6.1.2 For each reduction of 0.01 % below the maxi\u00ad\nmum specified phosphorus content, an increase of 0.08% \nsilicon above the specified maximum will be permitted up \nto a maximum of 2.75%. \nNOTE 2 - Silicon contents above 2.75%, or phosphorus contents above \n0.08 % have a tendency to lower the impact resistance of the material. \nIf the carbon content is below 3.00%, excess cementite may form during \ncooling and if this is not removed during heat treatment, the impact \nresistance of the material may be lowered. \n7. Requirements \n7.1 Tensile Properties: \n7.1.1 The ductile iron as represented by the test \nspecimens shall conform to the mechanical property \nrequirements in Table 1. \n7.2 Hardness: \n7 .2.1 For Grade 60-40-18, the hardness of the cast\u00ad\nings and test specimens shall be within the limits in Table 1. \n655 \n7.2.2 For Grade 65-45-15,the hardness oftest speci\u00ad\nmen and the critical area(s) of the casting, as identified on \nthe casting drawing, shall be within the limits in Table 1. If \nthe grade 65-45-15 casting drawing does not have critical \narea(s) of the casting identified, all areas of the casting \nshall be within the hardness limits in Table 1. \n7.3 Microstructure: \n7.3.1 For Grade 60-40-18, the microstructure of the \nseparately cast test coupon or the casting shall be essen\u00ad\ntially ferritic and contain no massive carbides, and have a \nminimum of 90% Type I and Type II Graphite as in Fig. 1 \nor Plate I of Test Method A 247. \n7.3.2 For Grade 65-45-15, the microstructure of the \ncritical areas of the casting, as identified on the casting \ndrawing, shall be 45% pearlitic, maximum, contain no \nmassive carbides, and have a minimum 90% Type I and \nType II Graphite as in Fig. 1 or Plate I of Test Method \nA247. \n7.4 Pressure Test Requirements: \n7 .4.1 Each pressure retaining Grade 60-40-18 casting \nshall be tested after machining to the test pressure specified \nby the applicable standard of ANSI, ASME Boiler and \nPressure Vessel Code, or other pertinent code, and shall \nshow no leaks. \n7.4.2 Castings Grade 65-45-15 manufactured under \nthis specification shall be capable of passing hydrostatic \ntest(s) compatible with the rating of the finished cast com\u00ad\nponent. Such tests shall be conducted by the casting manu\u00ad\nfacturer only when Supplementary Requirement S2 is \nspecified. ",
