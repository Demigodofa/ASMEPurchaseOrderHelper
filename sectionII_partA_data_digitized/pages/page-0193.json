Ordering Information \n3.1 Information items to be considered, if appropriate, for \ninclusion in the purchase order are as follows: \n3.1.1 Specification designation (A53 or A53M, including \nyear-date), \n3.1.2 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), \n3.1.3 Grade (A or B), \n3.1.4 Type (F, E, or S; see 1.2), \n3.1.5 Finish (black or galvanized), \n3.1.6 Size (either nominal (NPS) [DN] and weight class or \nschedule number, or both; or outside diameter and wall \nthickness, see Table X2.2 and Table X2.3), \n3.1.7 Length (specific or random, see Section 16), \n3.1.8 End finish (plain end or threaded, Section 11), \n3.1.8.1 Tln\u00b7eaded and coupled, if desired, \n3.1.8.2 Threads only (no couplings), if desired, \n3.1.8.3 Plain end, if desired, \n3.1.8.4 Couplings power tight, if desired, \n3.1.8.5 Taper-tapped couplings for NPS 2 [DN 50] and \nsmaller, if desired, \n3.1.9 Close coiling, if desired (see 7 .2.2), \n3.1.10 Nondestructive electric test for seamless pipe (see \n9.2), \n3.1.11 Certification (see Section 20), \n3.1.12 Repmi of the length of the end effect, if desired (see \n9.2.7), \n3.1.13 Marking (see Section 21), \n3.1.14 End use of pipe, \n3.1.15 Special requirements, \n3.1.16 Supplementary requirements, if any, \n3.1.17 Selection of applicable level of preservation and \npackaging and level of packing required, if other than as \nspecified or if MIL-STD-163 applies (see 22.1), and \n3 .1.18 Packaging and package marking, if desired ( see \n23.1). \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 The steel for both seamless and welded pipe shall be \nmade by one or more of the following processes: open-hearth, \nelectric-furnace, or basic-oxygen. \n4.2 If steels of different grades are sequentially strand cast, \nidentification of the resultant transition material is required. \nThe steel producer shall remove the transition material by any \nestablished procedure that positively separates the grades. \n4.3 The weld seam of electric-resistance welded pipe in \nGrade B shall be heat treated after welding to a minimum of \n1000 \u00b0F [540 \u00b0C] so that no untempered martensite remains, or \notherwise processed in such a manner that no untempered \nmartensite remains. \n4.4 When pipe is cold expanded, the amount of expansion \nshall not exceed 1 \u00bd % of the specified outside diameter of the \npipe. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to \nchemical composition given in Table 1 and the chemical \nanalysis shall be in accordance with Test Methods, Practices, \nand Terminology A751. \n141 \n6. Product Analysis \n6.1 The purchaser is permitted to perform an analysis of two \npipes from each lot of 500 lengths, or fraction thereof. Samples \nfor chemical analysis, except for spectrographic analysis, shall \nbe taken in accordance with Practice E1806. The chemical \ncomposition thus deterrnined shall conform to the requirements \ngiven in Table 1. ",
