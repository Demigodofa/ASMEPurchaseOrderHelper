INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Alloy Steel Forgings for Pressure and High-Temperature 
Parts 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A336/ A336M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers ferritic steel forgings for 
boilers, pressure vessels, high-temperature parts, and associ­
ated equipment. 
1.2 Forgings made of steel grades listed in Specification 
A335/A335M may also be ordered under this specification. 
The chemical, tensile, heat treatment, and marking require­
ments of Specification A335/A335M shall apply, except the 
forging shall conform to the chemical requirements of Tables 1 
and 2 of Specification A335/A335M only with respect to heat 
analysis. On product analysis they may deviate from these 
limits to the extent permitted in Table 1 of this specification. 
1.3 Supplementary Requirements S 1 to S 10 are provided for 
use when additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall 
apply only when specified individually by the purchaser in the 
order. 
1.4 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch­
pound units. 
1.5 Specification A336/ A336M formerly included austenitic 
steel forgings, which are now found in Specification A965/ 
A965M. 
1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other, and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, 
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee 
A0J.06 on Steel Forgings and Billets.
