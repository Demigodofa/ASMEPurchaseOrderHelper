ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-568/SA-568M (ASTM AS68/A568M) 
TABLE S1.4 Thickness Tolerances [Metric] for Hot-Rolled Sheet (Carbon and Structural Steel Only)-10-mm (Cut Edge) and 20-mm (Mill 
Edge) Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut Lengths, Including Pickled) 
NoTE I-Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than 10 mm from a cut edge and not less than 20 mm from a mill edge. This 
table does not apply to the uncropped ends of mill edge coils. 
NoTE 2-Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in. 
[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm]. 
Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements. 
NOTE 3-This table was used to construct Table Al.I by multiplying the values in this table by 0.75 and rounding to 2 decimal places using standard 
ASTM practice. 
NOTE 4-The thickness of material <25 mm wide shall be measured at mid-width.
