Quench records of production forgings shall be \nretained for future reference. The quench and temper record of \nthe master forging shall be retained as a permanent record. \nAl0.4.2.3 A copy of the master forging record shall be \nstored with the heat treatment record of the production forging. \nAl0.4.2.4 The essential variables, as set forth on the heat \ntreat record, shall be controlled within the given parameters on \nthe production forging. \nAl0.4.2.5 The temperature of the quenching medium prior \nto quenching each production forging shall be equal to or lower \nthan the temperature of the quenching medium prior to \nquenching the master forging. \nAl0.4.2.6 The time elapsed from opening the furnace door \nto quench for the production forging shall not exceed that \nelapsed for the master forging. \nAl0.4.2.7 If the time parameter is exceeded in opening the \nfurnace door to beginning of quench, the forging shall be \nplaced back into the furnace and brought back up to equaliza\u00ad\ntion temperature. \nAl0.4.2.8 All forgings represented by the same master \nforging shall be quenched with like orientation to the surface of \nthe quench bath. \nAl0.4.2.9 All production forgings shall be quenched in the \nsame quench tank, with the same agitation as the master \nforging. \nAl0.4.2.10 Uniformity of Heat Treat Parameters-(]) The \ndifference in actual heat treating temperature between produc\u00ad\ntion forgings and the master forging used to establish the \nsimulator cycle for them shall not exceed \u00b1 25 \u00b0P ( \u00b1 14 \u00b0C) for \nthe quench cycle. (2) The tempering temperature of the \nproduction forgings shall not fall below the actual tempering \ntemperature of the master forging. (3) At least one contact \nsurface thermocouple shall be placed on each forging in a \nproduction load. Temperature shall be recorded for all surface \nthermocouples on a Time Temperature Recorder and such \nrecords shall be retained as permanent documentation. \nAl0.4.3 Heat-cycle Simulation: \nAl0.4.3.1 Program charts shall be made from the data \nrecorded on the master chart. All test specimens shall be given \nthe same heating rate above, the ACl, the same holding time \nand the same cooling rate as the production forgings. \nAl0.4.3.2 The heating cycle above theACl, a portion of the \nholding cycle, and the cooling portion of the master chart shall \nbe duplicated and the allowable limits on temperature and time, \nas specified in (a) through (c), shall be established for \nverification of the adequacy of the simulated heat treatment. \n( a) Heat Cycle Simulation of Test Coupon Heat Treatment \nfor Quenched and Tempered Forgings and Bars-If cooling \nrate data for the forgings and bars and cooling rate control \ndevices for the test specimens are available, the test specimens \nmay be heat-treated in the device. \n(b) The test coupons shall be heated to substantially the \nsame maximum temperature as the forgings or bars. The test \ncoupons shall be cooled at a rate similar to and no faster than \nthe cooling rate representative of the test locations and shall be \nwithin 25 \u00b0P (14 \u00b0C) and 20 sat all temperatures after cooling \nbegins. The test coupons shall be subsequently heat treated in \naccordance with the thermal treatments below the critical \ntemperature including tempering and simulated post weld heat \ntreatment. \n(c) Simulated Post Weld Heat Treatment of Test Specimens \n(for ferritic steel forgings and bars)-Except for carbon steel (P \nNumber 1, Section IX of the Code) forgings and bars with a \nnominal thickness or diameter of 2 in. (51 mm) or less, the test \nspecimens shall be given a heat treatment to simulate any \nthermal treatments below the critical temperature that the \nTABLE A 10.1 Heat-treat Record-essential Variables \nMaster Production Production Production Production Production \nForging Foraing 1 Foraing 2 Forging 3 Forging 4 Forging 5 \nProqram chart number \nTime at temperature and actual temperature of heat treatment \nMethod of coolinq \nForginQ thickness \nThermocouple immersion \nBeneath buffer {yes/no) \nForaina number \nProduct \nMaterial \nThermocouple location-0 deq \nThermocouple location-180 deg \nQuench tank No. \nDate of heat treatment \nFurnace number \nCycle number \nHeat treater \nStartinQ quench medium temperature \nTime from furnace to auench \nHeatinq rate above 1000 \u00b0F (538 \u00b0C) \nTemoerature upon removal from auench after 5 min \nOrientation of forging in quench \n631 ",
