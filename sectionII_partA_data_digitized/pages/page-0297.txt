ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-193/SA-193M 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
These requirements shall not apply unless specified in the order and in the Ordering Information, 
in which event the specified tests shall be made before shipment of the product. 
Sl. High Temperature Tests 
S 1. 1 Tests to determine high temperature properties shall be 
made in accordance with Test Methods E21, E139, and E292, 
and Practices E150 and E151. 
S2. Charpy Impact Tests 
S2.1 Charpy impact tests based on the requirements of 
Specification A320/ A320M, Sections 6 and 7, shall be made as 
agreed between the manufacturer and the purchaser. When 
testing temperatures are as low as those specified in Specifi­
cation A320/A320M, bolting should be ordered to that speci­
fication in preference to this specification. 
S3. 100 % Hardness Testing of Grade B7M 
S3.1 Each Grade B7M bolt or stud shall be tested for 
hardness by indentation method and shall meet the require­
ments specified in Tables 2 and 3. 
S4. Hardness Testing of Grade B16 
S4.1 For bolts or studs 2½ in. [65 mm] or smaller, the 
hardness for Grade B 16 shall be measured on or near the end 
of each bolt or stud using one of the methods prescribed in 
9.2.1 for the Brinell or Rockwell C test. The hardness shall be 
in the range 253-319 HBW or 25-34 HRC. 
SS. Product Marking 
S5.1 Grade and manufacturer's identification symbols shall 
be applied to one end of studs and to the heads of bolts and 
screws of all sizes. (If the available area is inadequate, the 
grade symbol may be marked on one end and the manufactur­
er's identification symbol marked on the other end.) For bolts 
and screws smaller than¼ in. [6 mm] in diameter and studs 
smaller than 3/s in. [10 mm] in diameter and for ¼ in. [6 mm] 
in diameter studs requiring more than a total of three symbols, 
the marking shall be a matter of agreement between the 
purchaser and the manufacturer. 
S6. Stress Relieving 
S6.1 A stress-relieving operation shall follow straightening 
after heat treatment. 
S6.2 The minimum stress-relieving temperature shall be 
100 °F [55 °C] below the tempering temperature. Tests for 
mechanical properties shall be performed after stress relieving. 
S7. Magnetic Particle Inspection 
S7.1 Bars shall be magnetic particle examined in accor­
dance with Guide E709. Bars with indications of cracks or 
seams are subject to rejection if the indications extend more 
than 3 % of the diameter into the bar. 
SS. Stress-Relaxation Testing 
S8.1 Stress-Relaxation Testing, when required, shall be 
done in accordance with Test Methods E328. The test shall be 
performed at 850 °F [ 454 °C] for a period of 100 h. The initial 
stress shall be 50 M psi [345 MPa]. The residual stress at 100 
h shall be 17 M psi [117 MPa] minimum. 
S9. Grain Size Requirements for Non H Grade Austenitic 
Steels Used Above 1000 °F 
S9.1 For design metal temperatures above 1000 °F [540 
0 C], the material shall have a grain size of No. 7 or coarser as 
determined in accordance with Test Methods Ell2. The grain 
size so determined shall be reported on the Certificate of Test. 
SlO. Hardness Testing of Class 2 Bolting for ASME 
Applications 
S 10.1 The maximum hardness shall be Rockwell C35 im­
mediately under the thread roots. The hardness shall be taken 
on a flat area at least 1/s in. [3 mm] across, prepared by 
removing threads, and no more material than necessary shall be 
removed to prepare the flat areas. Hardness determinations 
shall be made at the same frequency as tensile tests. 
Sll. Thread Forming 
Sll.1 Threads shall be formed after heat treatment. Appli­
cation of this supplemental requirement to grade B7M or the 
grades listed in 6.2.4 is prohibited. 
245 
S12. Stress Rupture Testing of Grade B16 
S12.l One test shall be made for each heat treat lot. Testing 
shall be conducted using a combination test bar in accordance 
with Test Methods E292. Rupture shall occur in the smooth 
section of each test specimen. The test shall be conducted at 
1100 °F [595 °C] and 20 ksi [140 MPa]. The test shall be 
continued until the sample ruptures. Rupture life shall be 25 h 
minimum. Testing is not required on material less than ½ in. 
[12 mm] thick. 
Sl2.2 When a purchase order for bolting components in­
vokes S12, the grade symbol applied shall be "B16R." 
S13. Coatings on Bolting Components 
S13.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order all information required by the coating facility. 
Examples of such information may include but are not limited 
to the following: 
S 13 .1.1 Reference to the appropriate coating specification 
and type, thickness, location, modification to dimensions, and 
hydrogen embrittlement relief. 
Sl3.l.2 Reference to Specifications A153/A153M, B633, 
B695, B696, B766, orF1941/F1941M, F2329/F2329M, or Test 
Method F1940, or other standards.
