A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers electric-fusion-welded steel \npipe with filler metal added, fabricated from pressure vessel \nquality plate of several analyses and strength levels and \nsuitable for high-pressure service at atmospheric and lower \ntemperatures. Heat treatment may or may not be required to \nattain the desired properties or to comply with applicable code \nrequirements. Supplementary requirements are provided for \nuse when additional testing or examination is desired. \n1.2 The specification nominally covers pipe 16 in. [400 \nmm] in outside diameter or larger and of\u00bc in. [6 mm] wall \nthickness or greater. Pipe having other dimensions may be \nfurnished provided it complies with all other requirements of \nthis specification. \n1.3 Several grades and classes of pipe are provided. \n1.3.1 Grade designates the type of plate used as listed in 5.1. \n1.3.2 Class designates the type of heat treatment performed \nduring manufacture of the pipe, whether the weld is radio\u00ad\ngraphically examined, and whether the pipe has been pressure \ntested as listed in 1.3.3. \n1.3.3 Class designations are as follows (Note 1): \nClass Heat Treatment on Pipe Radiography, Pressure Test, \nsee Section see: \n10 none none none \n11 none 9 none \n12 none 9 8.3 \n13 none none 8.3 \n20 stress relieved, see 5.3.1 none none \n21 stress relieved, see 5.3.1 9 none \n22 stress relieved, see 5.3.1 9 8.3 \n23 stress relieved, see 5.3.1 none 8.3 \n30 normalized, see 5.3.2 none none \n31 normalized, see 5.3.2 9 none \n32 normalized, see 5.3.2 9 8.3 \n33 normalized, see 5.3.2 none 8.3 \n40 normalized and tempered, see 5.3.3 none none \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AOl on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nAOl.09 on Carbon Steel Tubular Products. \nCurrent edition approved March I, 2020.

For such guidance, Specification A20/ A20M may \nbe consulted. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
