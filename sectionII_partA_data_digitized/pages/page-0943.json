Additional Charpy Data \nS4.1 The percent shear fracture and mils of lateral \nexpansion, defined in Test Methods and Definitions A370, shall \nbe reported for each Charpy specimen tested. \nS4.2 Acceptance values for percent shear fracture and/or \nlateral expansion values shall be as specified by the purchaser. \nS5. Alternative Impact Test \nS5.1 Charpy impact tests shall be made in accordance with \nthe provisions of 7.2 of the specification except that the test \ntemperature shall be lower than specified in Table 3. This test \nshall be instead of that specified in 7 .2. \nS6. Drop-Weight Test \nS6.1 Drop-weight tests shall be conducted in accordance \nwith the requirements of Test Method B208. The fracture plane \nof the specimens shall coincide with the location required for \nother mechanical test specimens as specified by the purchaser \nin accordance with 7.1.6. However, since the drop weight \nspecimen can be taken in any orientation, the fracture plane of \nthe specimen when tested to Method 1 (7.l.6.1) shall be a \nminimum distance of 7/16 in. [11 mm] from the nearest \nquenched surface, and 1 \u00bd in. [38 mm] from any second \nsurface. The purchaser may specify either duplicate no-break \nperformance when tested 10 \u00b0F [6 \u00b0C] warmer than a specified \ntemperature or request a determination of the NDT tempera\u00ad\nture. \nS7. Restrictive Chemistry for Grades 4N and 5 \nS7 .1 Phosphorus and sulfur limits for Grades 4N and 5 shall \nbe 0.015 % maximum heat and 0.018 % maximum product. \nS8. Additional Vanadium \nS8.1 The vanadium content for Grade 5 forgings shall be \n0.05 to 0.15 %. \nS9. Restrictive Chemistry for Grades 2, 3, or 4N \nS9.1 Grades 2, 3, or 4N shall be specified with restricted \nphosphorus and copper limits, as follows: \nS9.1.1 P 0.012 maximum heat and 0.015 maximum product; \nCu 0.10 maximum heat and product, or \nS9.1.2 P0.015 maximumheatand0.018 maximum product; \nCu 0.15 maximum heat and product. \nS9.2 Grades 2, 3, 4N shall be specified with restricted sulfur \nof 0.D15 heat and 0,018 product. \nSlO. Alternative Fracture Toughness Requirements \nS10.1 The fracture toughness requirements (drop weight \nand Charpy impact tests) for materials oftheASME Boiler and \nPressure Vessel Code, Section III, Articles NB 2300, NC 2300, \nND 2300, NE 2300, NF 2300, or NG 2300, as specified, shall \nbe used instead of the Charpy impact test requirements of this \nspecification. \nSll. Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized Steels \nS11.1 Material made to Grades 1, la, 2, 3, 4N, or 5 shall be \nvacuum carbon-deoxidized, in which case the silicon content \nshall be 0.10 % max. The test report shall indicate that the steel \nwas vacuum carbon-deoxidized. \nS12. Vacuum-Treated Basic Oxygen Furnace Steels \nS12.1 For Grades 1, la, 2, or 3 material, vacuum-treated \nbasic oxygen furnace steel shall be used. \nS13. Minimum Tempering Temperature \nS13.1 For Grades 2 Class 1 and 3 Class 1 the minimum \ntempering temperature shall be 1175 \u00b0F [635 \u00b0C] and the \nsimulated post weld heat treatment temperature shall not \nexceed 1150 \u00b0F [620 \u00b0C] when S1 is required. \nS14. Cooling from -the Tempering Temperature \nS14.1 The purchaser shall provide specific cooling rates \nfrom the tempering temperature. \nS15. Product Analysis \nS15.1 More than one forging per heat shall be subject to \nproduct analysis by either the manufacturer or purchaser. The \npurchaser shall indicate in the ordering information the number \nof forgings to be tested, and whether the manufacturer, \npurchaser, or both shall perform the additional analyses. \nS16. Silicon Content \nS16.1 The silicon content shall be 0.05 to 0.15 % as a result \nof ladle refining with aluminum as the deoxidizer. Use of \nVacuum Ladle Degassing is optional. \n843 ",
