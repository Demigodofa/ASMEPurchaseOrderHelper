General Requirements for Delivery \n3.1 Structural products furnished under this specification \nshall conform to the requirements of the cmrent edition of \nSpecification A6/ A6M, for the specific structural product \nordered, unless a conflict exists in which case this specification \nshall prevail. \n3.2 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica\u00ad\ntion until they are processed into a finished structural product. \nStructural products produced from coil means structural prod\u00ad\nucts that have been cut to individual lengths from a coil. The \nprocessor directly controls, or is responsible for, the operations \ninvolved in the processing of a coil into a finished structural \nproduct. Such operations include decoiling, leveling or \nstraightening, hot-forming or cold-forming (if applicable), \ncutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, heat treat\u00ad\nment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for shipment, \nand certification. \nNoTE 1-For structural products produced from coil and furnished \nwithout heat treatment or with stress relieving only, two test results are to \nbe reported for each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding \nstructural products produced from coil are described in Specification \nA6/A6M. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 The steel shall be killed. \n1011 ",
