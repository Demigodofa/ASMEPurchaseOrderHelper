maximum section thickness. Except when Supplementary Re­
quirement S 13 is specified for Grades 2 and 3, the minimum 
tempering temperatures shall be as follows: 
Grades 1, 1A, 2 Class 2, and 3 Class 2

Grade 22, Class 3 1200 °F [650 °C] 
Grade 22, Classes 4, 5, 6, and 7 1100 °F [593 °C] 
Specific cooling rates from the tempering temperature shall 
be applied if Supplementary Requirement S 14 is specified. 
5.3 For Grades 1, lA, 2, 2A, 3, or 3A, a multiple stage 
austenitizing procedure may be used whereby the forging is 
first fully austenitized and liquid quenched, followed by 
reheating within the intercritical temperature range to partially 
reaustenitize and again liquid quenched. On completion of the 
austenitizing/quenching cycles, the forgings shall be tempered 
at a subcritical temperature as described in 5.2.2. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 Heat Analysis-The heat analysis obtained from sam­
pling in accordance with Specification A788/A788M shall 
comply with Table 1 except that the additional features of 
Supplementary Requirements S7, S8, S9, and SU shall also 
apply as individually specified in the ordering information. 
6.2 Product Analysis-The manufacturer shall use the prod­
uct analysis provision of Specification A788/A788M to obtain 
a product analysis from a forging representing each heat or 
multiple heat. The permissible variations provided in the table 
on Permissible Variations in Product Analysis for Killed Steel 
in Specification A788/A788M apply for manganese, nickel, 
chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium only. Boron is not 
subject to product analysis. The purchaser may also make this 
determination in accordance with Specification A788/A788M. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Tension Test: 
7 .1.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements of Table 2. 
7 .1.2 The location and number of tension test specimens for 
each forging or multiple forging shall be as follows: 
7.1.2.1 Individual Forgings with Weights Not Exceeding 
1000 lb [455 kg] or Multiple Forgings Separated into Identical 
Individual Forgings with Weights not Exceeding 1000 lb [455 
kg] Prior to Quenching and Tempering Treatment-At least 
one individual forging from each heat and each heat-treating 
lot shall be tested using the test specimen locations of 7 .1.5 or 
7.1.6 as specified on the purchase orders, except that test 
specimens located at midlength may be closer to the ends of the 
production forging than the specified distance to the second 
surfaces. All forgings shall be quenched and tempered in the 
same furnace charge. All forgings from the multiple shall be 
Brinell hardness tested after heat treatment and forgings not 
tested for mechanical properties shall have a Brinell Hardness 
within 20 points of the Brinell Hardness of the forging that has 
been tested for mechanical properties. 
7.1.2.2 Forgings or Multiple Forgings (Note 3) with Weight 
at Time of Heat Treatment Not Exceeding 10 000 lb [4540 kg] 
and Having a Heat-Treated Length (Exclusive of Test Prolon­
gation) of 80 in. [2032 mm] or Less-A test prolongation (Note 
4) shall be located at one end. One tension test specimen shall 
be taken from the test prolongation. 
7.1.2.3 Forgings or Multiple Forgings with Weight at Time 
of Heat Treatment Not Exceeding 10 000 lb [4540 kg] and 
Having a Heat-Treated Length (Exclusive of Test Prolonga­
tions) Exceeding 80 in. [2032 mm]-A test prolongation shall 
be located at each end. One tension test specimen shall be 
taken from each test prolongation. An orientation of 180° shall 
be established between the two tension test specimens. 
7.1.2.4 Forgings or Multiple Forgings with Weight at Time 
of Heat Treatment Over 10 000 lb [4540 kg] and Having a 
Heat-Treated Length (Exclusive of Test Prolongation) of 80 in. 
[2032 mm] or Less-A test prolongation shall be located atone 
end. Two tension test specimens shall be taken from the test 
prolongation and shall be oriented 180° apart. 
7.1.2.5 Forgings or Multiple Forgings with Weight at Time 
of Heat Treatment Over 10 000 lb [4540 kg] and Having a 
Heat-Treated Length (Exclusive of Test Prolongations) Exceed­
ing 80 in. [2032 mm]-A test prolongation shall be located at 
each end. The tension test specimens oriented 180° apart from 
each other shall be taken from each test prolongation. The two 
tension specimens located in one test prolongation shall be 
oriented 90° in relation to the two tension specimens located in 
the other test prolongation. 
NoTE 3-Multiple forgings in 7.1.2.2 through 7.1.2.5 are those which 
will be separated after the quench and temper treatment. 
NOTE 4--A test prolongation is defined as that integral test metal 
located at an end of the forging or forging multiples.

7 .1.3 Samples for mechanical test specimen shall be re­
moved from forgings after the quenching and tempering heat 
treatment. The sample material shall be subjected to a simu­
lated post weld heat treatment if Supplementary Requirement 
S 1 is specified. 
7 .1.4 For upset disk forgings, the longitudinal axis of the

parts, the longitudinal axis of the specimens shall be parallel to 
the direction of major working of the forging. 
7.1.5 Each forging shall be manufactured in accordance 
with a purchaser-approved drawing, showing the prequenched 
dimensions, the finished dimensions, the surfaces that will be 
subjected to critical stresses, and the location of mechanical 
test specimens.

the longitudinal axis and mid-length is in accordance with one 
of the following methods: 
7.1.6.1 Method 1-t by 2t, where tis the distance from the 
area of significant loading (see 4.1) to the nearest quenched 
surface. Specimens shall be removed at least 2t from the 
nearest second surface. However, they shall not be nearer to 
one quenched surface than ¾ in. [20 mm] and to the second 
quenched surface than 1 ½ in. [40 mm].
