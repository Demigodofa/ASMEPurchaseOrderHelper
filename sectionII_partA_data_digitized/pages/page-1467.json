Use of E70XX electrodes is recommended, and the \nresulting weld chemistry should meet the same chemistry \ncriteria as the base metal as listed above. \nS62. 7 In addition to the requirements of product marking of \nthe specification, a \"HF\" stamp or marking shall be provided \non each component to identify that component complies with \nthis supplementary requirement. \nS63 Pressure Equipment Directive-Mechanical Testing \nS63.1 Charpy impact testing shall be done at the lowest \nscheduled operating temperature but not higher than 68 \u00b0F [20 \noq. \nS63.2 The frequency of impact testing shall be the same as \nthat specified in the product specification for the tension test, \nwith three individual Charpy test specimens for each required \ntension test. \nS63.3 The minimum impact absorption energy for the \nCharpy test specimen shall be at least 20 ft/lb [27 J]. \nS63.4 The minimum elongation in the tension test shall be \nmeasured on a gauge length of five times the diameter of the \ntest specimen, and it shall not be less than 14 %. \nS63.5 Impact and tension test results shall be included in the \nproduct certification. \nANNEXES \n(Mandatory Information) \nAl. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW MATERIALS \nAl.1 New materials may be proposed for inclusion in \nspecifications referencing this specification of general require\u00ad\nments subject to the following conditions: \nAl.1.1 Application for the addition of a new grade to a \nspecification shall be made to the chair of the subcommittee \nthat has jurisdiction over that specification. \nAl.1.2 The application shall be accompanied by a statement \nfrom at least one user indicating that there is a need for the new \ngrade to be included in the applicable specification. \nAl.1.3 The application shall be accompanied by test data as \nrequired by the applicable specification. Test data from a \nminimum of three test lots, as defined by the specification, each \nfrom a different heat, shall be furnished. \nAl.1.4 The application shall provide recommendations for \nall requirements appearing in the applicable specification. \nAl.LS The application shall state whether or not the new \ngrade is covered by patent. \nA2. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF MATERIALS FROM OTHER A0l OR B02.07 SPECIFICATIONS \nA2.1 Wrought materials that are already covered by another \nA0l or B02.07 specification may be proposed for inclusion in \nspecifications referencing this specification of general require\u00ad\nments subject to the following conditions: \nA2.1.1 Application for the addition of a grade that is already \ncovered in another A0l or B02.07 specification shall be made \nto the chair of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over that \nspecification. \nA2.l.2 The chemical requirements, the specified mechani\u00ad\ncal properties, and the heat treatment requirements of the grade \nbeing added shall be the same as those for the grade in the A0l \nor B02.07 specification in which the grade is presently covered. \nA2.1.3 The application shall provide the recommendations \nfor all requirements appearing in the applicable specification. \nA2.1.4 The application shall state whether or not the grade \nis covered by patent. \n1409 ",
