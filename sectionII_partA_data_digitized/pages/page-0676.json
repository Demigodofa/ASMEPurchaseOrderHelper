A severely notched condition is generally \nnot desirable, and it becomes of real concern in those cases in \nwhich it initiates a sudden and complete failure of the brittle \ntype. Some metals can be deformed in a ductile manner even \ndown to the low temperatures of liquid air, while others may \ncrack. This difference in behavior can be best understood by \nconsidering the cohesive strength of a material (or the property \nthat holds it together) and its relation to the yield point. In cases \nof brittle fracture, the cohesive strength is exceeded before \nsignificant plastic defonnation occurs and the fracture appears \ncrystalline. In cases of the ductile or shear type of failure, \nconsiderable deformation precedes the final fracture and the \nbroken surface appears fibrous instead of crystalline. In inter\u00ad\nmediate cases the fracture comes after a moderate amount of \ndeformation and is part crystalline and part fibrous in appear\u00ad\nance. \nAS.2.2 When a notched bar is loaded, there is a normal \nstress across the base of the notch which tends to initiate \nfracture. The property that keeps it from cleaving, or holds it \ntogether, is the \"cohesive strength.\" The bar fractures when the \nnormal stress exceeds the cohesive strength. When this occurs \nwithout the bar deforming it is the condition for brittle fracture. \nA5.2.3 In testing, though not in service because of side \neffects, it happens more commonly that plastic deformation \nprecedes fracture. In addition to the normal stress, the applied \nload also sets up shear stresses which are about 45\u00b0 to the \nnormal stress. The elastic behavior terminates as soon as the \nshear stress exceeds the shear strength of the material and \ndeformation or plastic yielding sets in. This is the condition for \nductile failure. \nA5.2.4 This behavior, whether brittle or ductile, depends on \nwhether the normal stress exceeds the cohesive strength before \nthe shear stress exceeds the shear strength. Several important \nfacts of notch behavior follow from this. If the notch is made \nsharper or more drastic, the normal stress at the root of the \nnotch will be increased in relation to the shear stress and the \nbar will be more prone to brittle fracture ( see Table AS .1 ). Also, \nas the speed of deformation increases, the shear strength \nincreases and the likelihood of brittle fracture increases. On the \nother hand, by raising the temperature, leaving the notch and \nthe speed of deformation the same, the shear strength is \nlowered and ductile behavior is promoted, leading to shear \nfailure. \nA5.2.5 Variations in notch dimensions will seriously affect \nthe results of the tests. Tests on B4340 s_teel specimens have \nshown the effect of dimensional variations on Charpy results \n(see Table A5.l). \nAS.3 Size Effect \nA5.3.l Increasing either the width or the depth of the \nspecimen tends to increase the volume of metal subject to \ndistortion, and by this factor tends to increase the energy \nabsorption when breaking the specimen. However, any in\u00ad\ncrease in size, particularly in width, also tends to increase the \ndegree of restraint and by tending to induce brittle fracture, \nmay decrease the amount of energy absorbed. Where a \nstandard-size specimen is on the verge of brittle fracture, this is \nparticularly true, and a double-width specimen may actually \nrequire less energy for rupture than one of standard width. \nAS.3.2 In studies of such effects where the size of the \nmaterial precludes the use of the standard specimen, as for \nexample when the material is \u00bc-in. plate, subsize specimens \nare necessarily used. Such specimens (see Fig. 6 of Test \nMethods E23) are based on the Type A specimen of Fig. 4 of \nTest Methods E23. \nAS.3.3 General correlation between the energy values ob\u00ad\ntained with specimens of different size or shape is not feasible, \nbut limited correlations may be established for specification \npurposes on the basis of special studies of particular materials \nand particular specimens. On the other hand, in a study of the \nrelative effect of process variations, evaluation by use of some \narbitrarily selected specimen with some chosen notch will in \nmost instances place the methods in their proper order. \nAS.4 Effects of Testing Conditions \nAS.4.1 The testing conditions also affect the notch behavior. \nSo pronounced is the effect of temperature on the behavior of \nsteel when notched that comparisons are frequently made by \nTABLE A5.1 Effect of Varying Notch Dimensions on Standard Specimens \nSpecimen with standard dimensions \nDepth of notch, 0.084 in.
