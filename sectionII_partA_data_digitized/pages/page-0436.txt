13.3.3 Class 5-No single unbonded area exceeding 9 in.2 
(58 cm 2 ) with total unbonded area not to exceed 5 % of the 
total cladded surface area. 
13.3.4 The class to be supplied should be listed on the 
purchase order. When none has been specified, plates shall be 
furnished as Class 5 at the option of the manufacturer. 
14. Welding 
14.1 All welding which is part of the delivered product, 
including any made in the fabrication of the cladding alloy 
component, shall be performed with a procedure and welders 
or welding operators that are qualified in accordance with 
Section IX of the ASME Code. 
14.2 The material manufacturer may repair defects in clad­
ding by welding provided the following requirements are met: 
14.2.1 When specified in the purchase order, prior approval 
shall be obtained from the purchaser. 
14.2.2 The defective area shall be removed and the area 
prepared for repair shall be examined by a liquid penetrant 
method to ensure that all of the defective area has been 
removed. Method of test and acceptance standard shall be as 
agreed upon between the purchaser and the manufacturer. 
14.2.3 The repair weld shall be deposited in accordance 
with a welding procedure and welding materials suitable for 
the cladding material. The surface condition of the repaired 
area shall be restored to a condition similar to the rest of the 
cladding. 
14.2.4 The repaired area shall be examined by a liquid 
penetrant method. 
14.2.5 The location and extent of the weld repairs together 
with the repair procedure and examination results shall be 
transmitted as a part of the certification. 
15. General Requirements for Delivery 
15.1 Material furnished under this specification shall con­
form to the applicable requirements of Specification A20/ 
A20M. 
16. Certification 
16.1 The chemical analysis of the base metal and the alloy 
cladding shall be certified to the purchaser by the clad plate 
manufacturer. 
16.2 The results of the tests in Section 7 and any other tests 
required by the purchase order shall be reported to the 
purchaser. 
16.3 Compliance with the clad quality level of 13.3 shall be 
certified. Reports shall include the results of ultrasonic inspec­
tion when Supplementary Requirement S12 is specified. 
16.4 Compliance with any applicable construction code 
shall be certified and the appropriate documentation provided 
when appropriate in the case of explosively bonded clad 
produced using welded alloy cladding components (see 4.1.10 
and 4.1.12). 
17. Product Marking 
17 .1 Except as specified in 17 .2, plates shall be marked in 
accordance with the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M 
for the backing steel and the type number of the alloy cladding 
metal and this specification number. 
17.2 For double-clad material or for material under ¼ in. 
(6.35 mm) in thickness, the marking specified in 17.1 shall be 
legibly stenciled instead of stamped. 
18. Keywords 
18.1 alloy cladding; backing steel; bond strength; carbon 
steel; clad steel plate; low-alloy steel; pressure vessel; shear 
strength; stainless chromium-nickel steel 
SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
Supplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified on the order. A list of standardized 
supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser are included in Specification 
A20/ A20M. Several of those considered suitable for use with this specification are listed below by 
title. Other tests may be performed by agreement between the supplier and the purchaser.
