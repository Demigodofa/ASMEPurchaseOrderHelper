Scope \n1.1 This specification covers carbon steel shapes, plates, \nand bars of structural quality for use in riveted, bolted, or \nwelded construction of bridges and buildings, and for general \nstructural purposes. \n1.2 Supplementary requirements are provided for use where \nadditional testing or additional restrictions are required by the \npurchaser. Such requirements apply only when specified in the \npurchase order. \n1.3 When the steel is to be welded, a welding procedure \nsuitable for the grade of steel and intended use or service is to \nbe utilized. See Appendix X3 of Specification A6/A6M for \ninformation on weldability. \n1.4 The text of this specification contains notes or footnotes, \nor both, that provide explanatory material. Such notes and \nfootnotes, excluding those in tables and figures, do not contain \nany mandatory requirements. \n1.5 For structural products produced from coil and fur\u00ad\nnished without heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the \nadditional requirements, including additional testing require\u00ad\nments and the reporting of additional test results, of Specifi\u00ad\ncation A6/ A6M apply. \n1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system is to \nbe used independently of the other, without combining values \nin any way. \n1.7 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
