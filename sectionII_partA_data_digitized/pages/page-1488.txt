SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
One or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the 
purchaser in the inquiry, contract, and order. Details of these supplementary requirements shall be 
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. 
Sl. Rough Turning and Boring 
S 1.1 The position of the rough turning and boring in the 
sequence of manufacturing operations shall be specified. 
S2. Transverse Tension Test 
S2.1 Instead of the test specimen orientation requirements 
in 8.3, the longitudinal axis of the test specimens shall be 
transverse to the direction of major working of the forging. The 
results shall conform with requirements of Table 2, with the 
exception of the ductility limits, which shall be as prescribed in 
Table S2.1. 
S3. Hydrostatic Test 
S3. l A hydrostatic pressure test shall be applied. The details 
of the test, including its position in the sequence of manufac­
turing operations, shall be specified. 
S4. Stabilization Heat Treatment 
S4.1 When specified, Grades F347 and F321 shall receive 
stabilization treatment, which shall consist of holding the 
forging at 1500 to 1600 °F [815 to 870 °C], for not less than 
2 h/2n. of thickness and then cooling in the furnace or in still 
air. 
SS. Marking 
S5.1 Forgings shall be marked at a location indicated by the 
purchaser in the purchase order or drawing. 
S6. Individual Forging 
S6.1 Forgings, whether identical or not identical, shall be 
produced individually. They shall not be forged in multiple and 
separated prior to or after heat treatment. 
S6.2 The shape and size of individual forgings shall be 
agreed between the manufacturer and the purchaser by means 
of a forging drawing or the purchase order. 
S7. Grain Size Requirements for Service Exceeding 
1000 °F [540 °C] 
S7.1 For design metal temperatures above 1000 °F 
[540 °C], the forgings shall have a grain size of 7 or coarser as 
detennined in accordance with Test Methods El12. The actual 
grain size shall be reported on the certificate of test. 
SS. Ultrasonic Inspection 
S8.1 An ultrasonic inspection of the machined forging shall 
be made in accordance with Practice A745/A745M to the 
quality acceptance level specified in the purchase order or 
contract.
