General Precautions \n3.1 The ASTM track is the default track; if other than the \nASTM track is used that track shall be reported. \n3.2 Certain methods of fabrication, such as bending, \nforming, and welding, or operations involving heating, may \naffect the properties of the material under test. Therefore, the \nproduct specifications cover the stage of manufacture at which \nmechanical testing is to be performed. The properties shown by \ntesting prior to fabrication may not necessarily be representa\u00ad\ntive of the product after it has been completely fabricated. \n3.3 Improper machining or preparation of test specimens \nmay give erroneous results. Care should be exercised to assure \ngood workmanship in machining. Improperly machined speci\u00ad\nmens should be discarded and other specimens substituted. \n3.4 Flaws in the specimen may also affect results. If any test \nspecimen develops flaws, the retest provision of the applicable \nproduct specification shall govern. \n3 .5 If any test specimen fails because of mechanical reasons \nsuch as failure of testing equipment or improper specimen \npreparation, it may be discarded and another specimen taken. \n4. Orientation of Test Specimens \n4.1 The terms \"longitudinal test\" and \"transverse test\" are \nused only in material specifications for wrought products and \nare not applicable to castings. When such reference is made to \na test coupon or test specimen, the following definitions apply: \n4.1.1 Longitudinal Test, unless specifically defined \notherwise, signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is \nparallel to the direction of the greatest extension of the steel \nduring rolling or forging. The stress applied to a longitudinal \ntension test specimen is in the direction of the greatest \nextension, and the axis of the fold of a longitudinal bend test \nspecimen is at right angles to the direction of greatest exten\u00ad\nsion. \n4.1.2 Transverse Test, unless specifically defined otherwise, \nsignifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is at right \nangles to the direction of the greatest extension of the steel \nduring rolling or forging. The stress applied to a transverse \ntension test specimen is at right angles to the greatest \nextension, and the axis of the fold of a transverse bend test \nspecimen is parallel to the greatest extension. \n4.2 The terms \"radial test\" and \"tangential test\" are used in \nmaterial specifications for some wrought circular products and \nare not applicable to castings .. When such reference is made to \na test coupon or test specimen, the following definitions apply: \n4.2.1 Radial Test, unless specifically defined otherwise, \nsignifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is perpen\u00ad\ndicular to the axis of the product and coincident with one of the \nradii of a circle drawn with a point on the axis of the product \nas a center. \n4.2.2 Tangential Test, unless specifically defined otherwise, \nsignifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is perpen\u00ad\ndicular to a plane containing the axis of the product and tangent \nto a circle drawn with a point on the axis of the product as a \ncenter. \n1543 ",
