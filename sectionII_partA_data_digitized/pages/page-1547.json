Rejection \n24.1 Each length of pipe received from the manufacturer \nmay be inspected by the purchaser and, if it does not meet the \nrequirements of the specification based upon the inspection and \ntest method as outlined in the applicable product specification, \nthe length may be rejected and the manufacturer shall be \nnotified. Disposition of rejected pipe shall be a matter of \nagreement between the manufacturer and the purchaser. \n24.2 Pipe that fails in any of the forming operations or in the \nprocess of installation and is found to be defective shall be set \naside and the manufacturer shall be notified for mutual \nevaluation of the suitability of the pipe. Disposition of such \npipe shall be matter for agreement. \n25.

Marking shall begin approxi\u00ad\nmately 12 in. [300 mm] from the end of each length of pipe. \nFor pipe less than NPS 2 and pipe under 3 ft [1 m] in length, \nthe required information may be marked on a tag securely \nattached to the bundle or box in which the pipes are shipped. \n26.2 When pipe marked as specified is rejected, the ASTM \ndesignation shall be canceled. \n26.3 For austenitic steel pipe, the marking paint or ink shall \nnot contain detrimental amounts of harmful metals, or metal \nsalts, such as zinc, lead, or copper, which cause conosive \nattack on heating. \n26.4 Pipes that have been weld repaired in accordance with \n17 .1 shall be marked WR. \n26.5 When it is specified that certain requirements of a \nspecification adopted by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel \nCommittee are to be completed by the purchaser upon receipt \nof the material, the manufacturer shall indicate that all require\u00ad\nments of the specification have not been completed by a letter \nsuch as X, Y, or Z, immediately following the specification \nnumber. This letter may be removed after completion of all \nrequirements in accordance with the specification. An expla\u00ad\nnation of specification requirements to be completed is pro\u00ad\nvided in 25. l. \n27.
