MANDATORY APPENDIX II 
ASME MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS 
11-100 GENERAL 
ASME material specifications are derived from pub­
lished standards of standard development organizations 
(herein referred to as source standards). If it is deter­
mined that a particular source standard can be of use 
for BPVC purposes, then it is modified as necessary to 
conform to BPVC requirements, and subsequently pub­
lished in Section II as an ASME material specification. A 
list of all ASME material specifications is in the "Specifica­
tion" column of Tables 11-200-1 and 11-200-2. 
11-200 SOURCE STANDARDS 
The source standard from which an ASME material 
specification was derived is part of the specification's des­
ignation, as shown below.

The "Latest Adopted" column of Tables 11-200-1 and 
11-200-2 states which edition (revision) of the source 
standard is the framework for the current ASME material 
specification. The "Description" column explains any 
changes made to the source standard when it was 
adopted as an ASME material specification. 
11-300 PERMISSIBILITY OF SUPERSEDED 
EDITIONS FOR ASME CONSTRUCTION 
At times, the publishing organization will update its 
standard and supersede the previous edition. When this 
occurs, the BPVC II committee may choose to evaluate 
the update and adopt it as the framework for the ASME 
material specification. 
The Section II committee may also choose to continue 
to allow for Code construction a previously accepted 
but now superseded edition. If allowed, the Statement 
of Policy on the Use of ASME Material Specifications is in­
voked and caveats listed in the "Description" column shall 
be met. Any superseded editions permitted are refer­
enced in the column "All Acceptable Editions" of Tables 
11-200-1 and 11-200-2. 
If no superseded editions are currently permitted for 
use, then ellipses ( ... ) will appear in the "All Acceptable 
Editions" column. 
11-400 STRUCTURE OF ASME MATERIAL 
SPECIFICATIONS 
This paragraph gives examples of deciphering from 
Tables 11-200-1 and 11-200-2 the structure of ASME mate­
rial specifications as well as which editions of a source 
standard are permitted for use. These examples are based 
on Figure II-400-1. The specifications in the figure are 
based on editions found in BPVC Section II, Parts A and 
B, 2021 Edition. 
(a) SA-217/SA-217M. The standard adopted was ASTM 
A217 /A217M. The 2007 edition (A217 /A217M-07) is 
the latest adopted. The word "Identical" is listed in the 
"Description" column; this means that ASME material 
specification SA-217 /SA-217M is identical to ASTM 
A217 /A217M-07. The "All Acceptable Editions" column 
indicates that revisions 1993 through 2007, inclusive, 
are permitted for construction. 
(b) SA-513. The standard adopted was ASTM A513. The 
2000 edition (A513-00) is the latest adopted. The "De­
scription" column indicates that for the ASTM specifica­
tion to be used as ASME material specification SA-513, 
its Supplementary Requirements S6 and either S7 or SB 
are mandatory. Ellipses ( ... ) are listed under the "All Ac­
ceptable Editions" column. This means that only the edi­
tion listed under the "Latest Adopted" column - ASTM 
A513-00 - is permitted for Code construction. 
(c) SA/CSA G40.21. The standard adopted was CSA 
G40.21. The latest edition adopted is 2013(R2018). This 
means that the 2018 edition is the latest adopted, and that 
it is a reapproval of the 2013 edition [(CSA G40.21-2013 
(R2018)]. The ASME material specification was modified 
to have additional requirements for marking, chemical 
composition, controlled and normalized rolling, and pro­
viding a test report. The only CSA G40.21 editions per­
mitted for construction are 1992, and 2004 through 
2018, inclusive. 
(d) SB-166. The standard adopted was ASTM B166, 
2011 edition (B166-11). The ASME material specification 
has been modified to require certification and test report 
be given to the purchaser; and that the details of
