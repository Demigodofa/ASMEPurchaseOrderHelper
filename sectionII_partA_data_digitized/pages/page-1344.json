[1.5 mm] \nin major dimensions that are aligned and separated by 1/16 in. \n[1.5 mm] or less end to end. \nS19.2.3 Ten or more indications exceeding 1/16 in. [1.5 mm] \nin major dimensions contained in any 6 in.2 [40 cm 2 ] of \n\u2022 surface, with the major dimension in this area not to exceed \n6 in. [150 mm]. The area shall be taken in the most unfavorable \nlocation relative to the indications being evaluated. \nS20. Ultrasonic Examination \nS20.1 illtrasonic examination of forgings shall be carried \nout in accordance with Practice A388/A388M. \nS20.2 Unless otherwise agreed upon between the manufac\u00ad\nturer and the purchaser, acceptance levels BR or DA shall be \nspecified for the longitudinal wave examination and level S for \nshear wave examination. \nLevel BR-Longitudinal Wave \n. S20.2.1 The back reflection method of tuning shall be used \n\u2022\u2022\u2022 in accordance with Practice A388/A388M. \nS20.2.2 In addition to the reportable conditions of the \nRecording Section of Practice A388/A388M, indications ex\u00ad\nceeding the resultant back reflection shall be recorded. \nS20.2.3 The following conditions are subject to rejection, or \nrepair if applicable. \nS20.2.3.1 Complete loss of back reflection accompanied by \nan indication of a discontinuity. For this purpose, a back \nreflection less than 5 % of full screen height shall be consid\u00ad\nered complete loss of back reflection. \nS20.2.3.2 An indication equal in amplitude to that of the \nback reflection established in an indication-free portion of the \nforging. \nLevel DA-Longitudinal Wave \nS20.2.4 Reference blocks of acoustically similar metal shall \nbe used for calibration. Blocks shall meet one of the following \nrequirements: \nS20.2.4.1 A comparison of the back reflections between \nequivalent thicknesses of the reference block material and the \nactual forging to be tested, without change in instrument \nsetting shall not show a variation in excess of 25 %. \nS20.2.4.2 The reference blocks shall be manufactured from \nsteel that is similar in chemistry and processing history to the \nproduction forging being tested. The reference blocks shall be \nfabricated in accordance with the procedures of Practice E428. \nS20.2.4.3 For test sections up to and including 12 in. \n[300 mm] thick, the reference blocks shall contain a \u00bc in. \n[6 mm] diameter flat-bottom hole; for over 12 in. [300 mm] up \nto and including 18 in. [300 to 450 mm], the hole diameter \nshall be 3 /s in. [10 mm]; and for over 18 in. [450 mm], it shall \nbe \u00bd in. [13 mm]. \nS20.2.4.4 A distance-amplitude correction curve shall be \nestablished for the proper grade of steel and specified hole size. \nS20.2.4.5 A forging containing one or more indications \nequal in amplitude to that of the applicable reference hole, \nwhen properly corrected for distance, is subject to rejection, or \nrepair if applicable. \nLevel S-Shear Wave \nS20.2.5 Calibration notches, calibration reference, and \nmethod of scanning shall be in accordance with Practice \nA388/A388M. Unless otherwise agreed upon, a 60\u00b0 V-notch \nshall be used. \nS20.2.6 A forging containing a discontinuity that results in \nan indication exceeding the amplitude of the reference line is \nsubject to rejection. \nS20.2.7 The report of the ultrasonic examination shall be in \ncompliance with Practice A388/A388M. \nS20.2.8 Additional nondestructive examination or trepan\u00ad\nning may be employed to resolve questions of interpretation of \nultrasonic indications. The manufacturer shall accept respon\u00ad\nsibility for injurious conditions that will not be removed in final \nmachining. \nS21. Additional Test Coupon Heat Treatment \nS21.1 When subcritical heat treatment, applied to a com\u00ad\npleted forging during subsequent fabrication, may affect the \nmechanical properties of the forging, then coupons for the \nmechanical testing required by the product specification shall \nbe given a laboratory heat treatment, which simulates the \nanticipated subcritical heat treatment. \nS21.2 The purchaser shall specify the required heat treat\u00ad\nment temperature range, minimum time at temperature, and the \nrates of heating and cooling. \nS21.3 The required number of test coupons shall be taken \nfrom the forging location described in the product specifica\u00ad\ntion. \nS21.4 The test specimens shall meet the minimum mechani\u00ad\ncal test requirements of the product specification, as well as \nthose of any additional tests agreed upon between producer and \npurchaser, after completion of the test coupon heat treatment. \nS21.5 The forgings supplied in accordance with this supple\u00ad\nmentary requirement shall be marked in accordance with \n17.1.7. \nS21.6 The material test reports shall include the heat treat\u00ad\nment of the as-delivered material and the results of the \nmechanical tests from the test coupons subjected to the \npurchaser specified heat treatments that represent fabrication. \nS22. Ultrasonic Examination from Bore Surface \nS22.1 Bored cylindrical forgings shall be examined from the \nbored surface in accordance with Practice A939/ A939M. The \nacceptance criteria shall be agreed upon between the purchaser \nand the producer. \nS23. Magnetic Particle Examination Using AC Current \nS23.1 The designated surfaces of ferromagnetic steel forg\u00ad\nings shall be examined at the stage in machining specified by \nthe purchaser in accordance with Practice A966/ A966M. The \nacceptance criteria for the examination shall be specified by the \npurchaser. \nS24. Jractor \nS24.1 The Jfactor\u2022 calculated by means of the following \nequation, shall be established for each heat of steel used in \nforging manufacture: \n1282 ",
