All weld repairs shall \nbe inspected to the same quality standards used to inspect the \npipe. \n11.4 Reheat Treatment-Local or full heat treatment in \naccordance with 5.2 shall follow welding. Local grinding \nfollowing welding and retreating shall be considered as meet\u00ad\ning the requirements of 5 .1. \n12. Product Marking \n12.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification \nA530/A530M, the marking shall include the wall thickness, \npiece mark, length and additional symbol \"S\" if the pipe \nconforms to one or more of the supplementary requirements \nspecified in Sl to S9, and the heat number or manufacturer's \nnumber by which the heat can be identified. Identification \nstamping instead of stenciling will be permitted only with the \nwritten approval of the purchaser. \n12.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 12.1, \nbar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification \nmethod. The purchaser may specifiy in the order a specific bar \ncoding system to be used. \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nOne or more of the following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified in the \npurchase order. The purchaser may specify a different frequency of test or analysis than is provided \nin the supplementary requirement. Subject to agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, \nretest and retreatment provisions of these supplementary requirements may also be modified. \nSl. Product Analysis \nS 1. l Product analysis shall be made on each length of pipe. \nIndividual lengths failing to conform to the chemical compo\u00ad\nsition requirements shall be rejected. \nS2. Additional Tension Tests \nS2. l An additional tension test shall be made on a specimen \nfrom one or each end of each pipe. If this supplementary \nrequirement is specified, the number of tests per pipe required \nshall be specified. If a specimen from any length fails to meet \nthe required tensile properties (tensile, yield, and elongation), \nthat length shall be rejected subject to retreatment in accor\u00ad\ndance with Specification A530/A530M and satisfactory retest. \nS3. Additional Flattening Tests \nS3.1 The flattening test of Specification A530/A530M shall \nbe made on a specimen from one end or both ends of each pipe. \nCrop ends may be used. If this supplementary requirement is \nspecified, the number of tests per pipe shall also be specified. \nIf a specimen from any length fails because of lack of ductility \nprior to satisfactory completion of the first step of the flattening \ntest requirement that pipe shall be rejected subject to retreat\u00ad\nment in accordance with Specification A530/A530M and \nsatisfactory retest. If a specimen from any length. of pipe fails \nbecause of a lack of soundness that length shall be rejected, \nunless subsequent retesting indicates that the remaining length \nis sound. \nS4. Metal Structure and Etching Tests \nS4.1 The steel shall be homogeneous as shown by etching \ntests conducted in accordance with the appropriate portions of \nMethod E381. Etching tests shall be made on a cross section \nfrom one end or both ends of each pipe and shall show sound \nand reasonably uniform material free from injurious lamina\u00ad\ntions, cracks, and similar objectionable defects. If this supple\u00ad\nmentary requirement is specified, the number of tests per pipe \nrequired shall also be specified. If a specimen from any length \nshows objectionable defects, the length shall be rejected, \nsubject to removal of the defective end and subsequent retests \nindicating the remainder of the length to be sound and \nreasonably uniform material. \nSS. Photomicrographs \nS5.1 The manufacturer shall furnish one photomicrograph \nat 100 diam.eters from a specimen of pipe in the as-finished \ncondition representing each heat in each heat-treatment lot. \nSuch photomicrographs shall be suitably identified as to pipe \nsize, wall thickness, and heat. No photomicrographs for the \nindividual pieces purchased shall be required except as speci\u00ad\nfied in Supplementary Requirement S6. Such photomicro\u00ad\ngraphs are for information only, to show the actual metal \nstructure of the pipe as furnished. \nS6. Photographs for Individual Pieces \nS6.1 In addition to the photomicrographs required in accor\u00ad\ndance with Supplementary Requirement S5, the purchaser may \nspecify that photomicrographs shall be furnished from one or \nboth ends of each pipe. All photomicrographs required shall be \nproperly identified as to heat number, size, and wall thickness \nof pipe from which the section was taken. Photomicrographs \nshall be further identified to permit association of each photo\u00ad\nmicrograph with the individual length of pipe it represents. \nS7. Radiographic Inspection \nS7 .1 The pipe shall be examined for internal defects by \nmeans of X rays or gamma rays. The inspection procedure shall \nbe in accordance with Practice E94 or Method E142 and the \ntypes and severity levels of discontinuities considered shall be \njudged by Reference Radiographs E446, or Reference Radio\u00ad\ngraphs E186. The extent of examination and the basis for \nacceptance shall be subject to agreement between the manu\u00ad\nfacturer and the purchaser. A specification which may be used \nas a basis for such agreement is \"Quality Standard for Steel \nCastings for Valves, Flanges and Fittings and Other Piping \n1074 ",
