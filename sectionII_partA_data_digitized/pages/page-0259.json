Chemical Composition \n5.1 An analysis of each heat shall be made by the \nmanufacturer to determine the percentages of the elements \nspecified in Table 1. The chemical composition thus deter\u00ad\nmined shall conform to the requirements in Table 1. \n6. Mechanical Properties \n6.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as \nto tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. \n7. Number of Tests \n7 .1 One tension test shall be made from each heat. \n7.2 If any test specimen is defectively machined, it \nmay be discarded and another specimen substituted. \n8. Retests \n8.1 When one or more representative 'test specimens \ndo not conform to specification requirements for the tested \ncharacteristic, only a single retest for each nonconforming \ncharacteristic may be performed to establish product \nacceptability. Retests shall be performed on twice the num\u00ad\nber of representative specimens that were originally non\u00ad\nconforming. When any retest specimen does not conform \nto specification requirements for the characteristic in ques\u00ad\ntion, the lot represented by that specimen shall be rejected, \nheat-treated or reheat-treated in accordance with 4.5, and \ntested in accordance with Sections 6 and 7. \n9. Reports of Testing \n9.1 Upon request of the purchaser in the contract or \norder, a report of the test results and chemical analyses \nshall be furnished. The specification designation included \non reports of testing shall include year of issue and revision \nletter, if any. \n10. Repair by Welding \n10.1 Repair welding, by the manufacturer, is permissi\u00ad\nble for parts made to dimensional standards such as those \nof ANSI or equivalent standards. \n207 \n10.2 Prior approval of the purchaser shall be required \nto weld repair special parts made to the purchaser's require\u00ad\nments. \n10.3 The composition of the weld deposits shall be \nsimilar to the base metal and in accordance with the proce\u00ad\ndure qualification for the applicable material. Welding shall \nbe accomplished with a weld procedure designed to pro\u00ad\nduce low hydrogen in the weldment. Short-circuit gas metal \narc welding is permissible only with the approval of the \npurchaser. \n11. Marking of Forgings \n11.1 Identification marks consisting of the manufactur\u00ad\ner's symbol or name, designation of service rating, Speci\u00ad\nfication number, class, and size shall be legibly forged or \nstamped on each forging, and in such a position as not to \ninjure the usefulness of the forgings. \n11.2 Bar Coding - In addition to the requirements in \n11.1, bar coding is acceptable as a supplementary identifi\u00ad\ncation method. The purchaser may specify in the order a \nspecific bar coding system to be used. The bar coding \nsystem, if applied at the discretion of the supplier, should \nbe consistent with one of the published industry standards \nfor bar coding. If used on small parts the bar code may be \napplied to the box or a substantially applied tag. \n12. Certificate of Compliance \n12.1 When specified in the purchase order or contract, \na producer's or supplier's certification shall be furnished to \nthe purchaser that the material was manufactured, sampled, \ntested, and inspected in accordance with this specification \nand has been found to meet the requirements. The specifi\u00ad\ncation designation included on certificates of compliance \nshall include year of issue and revision letter, if any. \n12.2 When specified in the purchase order or contract, \na rep01t of the test results shall be furnished. \n13. Keywords \n13.1 pipe fittings, steel; piping applications; pressure \ncontaining parts; steel forgings, carbon; steel valves ",
