SA-387 /SA-387M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Standard Specification for 
Pressure Vessel Plates, Alloy Steel, Chromium­
Molybdenum 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers chromium-molybdenum alloy 
steel plates intended primarily for welded boilers and pressure 
vessels designed for elevated temperature service. 
1.2 Plates are available under this specification in several 
grades having different alloy contents as follows: 
Nominal Nominal 
Chromium Molybdenum 
Grade Content, % Content, % 
2 0~ 0~ 
12 1.00 0.50 
11 1.25 0.50 
22 2.25 1.00 
21 3.00 ·1.00 
5 5.00 0.50 
9 9.00 1.00 
91 9.00 1.00 
1.3 Each grade except Grade 91 is available in two classes 
of tensile strength levels as defined in the Tensile Requirements 
tables. Grade 91 is available only as Class 2. Grade 91 consists 
of two types, with Type 2 differentiated from Type 1 by 
requiring restricted composition for the enhancement of creep 
resistance. 
Norn I-Grade 911, previously covered by this specification, is now 
covered by Specification Al017/Al0l7M. 
1.4 The maximum thickness of plates is limited only by the 
capacity of the composition to meet the specified mechanical 
property requirements. 
1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system are not exact equivalents. Therefore, each system mnst 
648 
be used independently of the other. Combining values from the 
two systems may result in nonconformance with this specifi­
cation. 
1.6 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
