Common Requirements and Ordering Information \n3.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A960/ A960M including any \nsupplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase \norder. Failure to comply with the common requirements of \nSpecification A960/A960M constitutes nonconformance with \nthis specification. In case of conflict between this specification \nand Specification A960/ A960M, this specification shall pre\u00ad\nvail. \n3.2 Specification A960/A960M identifies the ordering infor\u00ad\nmation that should be complied with when purchasing material \nto this specification. \n4. Material \n4.1 The material for fittings shall consist of forgings, bars, \nplates, or seamless or welded tubular products that conform to \nthe chemical requirements in Table 2. See Table 3 for a list of \ncommon names. \n4.2 The steel shall be melted by one of the following \nprocesses: \n4.2.1 Electric furnace (with separate degassing and refining \noptional), \n4.2.2 Vacuum furnace, or \n4.2.3 One of the former followed by vacuum or electroslag\u00ad\nconsumable remelting. \n4.3 If secondary melting is employed, the heat shall be \ndefined as all ingots remelted from a primary heat. \n4.4 Grain Size-Annealed Alloys UNS N08810 and UNS \nN08811 shall conform to an average grain size of ASTM No. \n5 or coarser. \n5. Manufacture \n5.1 Forming-Forging or shaping operations may be per\u00ad\nformed by hammering, pressing, piercing, extruding, upsetting, \nrolling, bending, fusion welding, machining, or by a combina\u00ad\ntion of two or more of these operations. The forming procedure \nshall be so applied that it will not produce injurious defects in \nthe fittings. \n5.2 All fittings shall be heat treated in accordance with \nSection 6. \n5.3 Grade WP fittings ordered as Class S shall be of \nseamless construction and shall meet all requirements of \nASME B16.9, ASME B16.ll, MSS SP-79, MSS SP-83, MSS \nSP-95, or MSS SP-97. \n5.4 Grade WP fittings ordered as Class W shall meet the \nrequirements of ASME B16.9 and: \n5.4.1 Shall have all pipe welds made by mill or the fitting \nmanufacturer with the addition of filler metal radiographically \nexamined throughout the entire length in accordance with the \nCode requirements stated in 5.5, and, \n5.4.2 Radiographic inspection is not required on single \nlongitudinal seam welds made by the starting pipe manufac\u00ad\nturer if made without the addition of filler metal; and \n5.4.3 Radiographic inspection is not required on longitudi\u00ad\nnal seam fusion welds made by the fitting manufacturer when \nall of the following conditions have been met: \n5.4.3.1 No addition of filler metal, \n5.4.3.2 Only one welding pass per weld seam, and, \n5.4.3.3 Fusion welding from one side only. \n5.4.4 In place of radiographic examination, welds made by \nthe fitting manufacturer may be ultrasonically examined in \naccordance with the Code requirements stated in 5.6. \n5.5 Grade WP fittings ordered as Class WX shall meet the \nrequirements of ASME B 16. 9 and shall have all welds, whether \nmade by the fitting manufacturer or the starting material \nmanufacturer, radiographically exf[mined throughout their en\u00ad\ntire length in accordance with Paragraph UW-51 of Section \nVill, Division I, of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. \n5.6 Grade WP fittings ordered as Class WU shall meet the \nrequirements of ASME B16.9 and shall have all welds, whether \nmade by the fitting manufacturer or the starting material \nmanufacturer, ultrasonically examined throughout their entire \nlength in accordance with Appendix 12 of Section VITI, \nDivision 1 of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. \n675 \n5.7 The radiography or ultrasonic examination of welds for \nthis class of fittings may be done at the option of the \nmanufacturer, either prior to or after forming.
