Ordering Information \n3.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the \npurchase order information necessary to purchase the needed \nmaterial. In addition to the ordering information guidelines in \nSpecification A961/A961M, orders should include the follow\u00ad\ning information: \n3.1.1 The number of test reports required (see Section 14). \n3.1.2 Additional requirements (see Table 1 footnotes). \n3.1.3 Options in the specification. See 5.4.2.1. \n4. General Requirements \n4.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A961/A961M, including any \nsupplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase \norder. Failure to comply with the general requirements of \nSpecification A961/A961M constitutes nonconformance with \nthis specification. In case of conflict between the requirements \nof this specification and Specification A961/A961M, this \nspecification shall prevail. \n5. Manufacture \n5.1 Melting Process-The steel shall be produced by any of \nthe following primary processes: open-hearth, basic oxygen, \nelectric-furnace, or vacuum-induction melting (VIM). The \nprimary melting may incorporate separate degassing or \nrefining, and may be followed by secondary melting using \nelectroslag remelting (ESR), or vacuum-arc remelting (VAR). \n5.1.1 The steel shall be fully killed, fine-grain practice. \n5.1.2 The molten steel may be vacuum treated prior to or \nduring pouring of the ingot. \n5.2 Discard-A sufficient discard shall be made to secure \nfreedom from injurious piping and undue segregation. \n5.3 Forging Process: \n5.3.1 Material for forgings shall consist of ingots, or forged, \nrolled, or strandcast blooms, billets, slabs, or bars. \n5.3.2 The finished product shall be a forging as defined in \nthe Terminology section of Specification A788/A788M. \n5.3.3 Hollow parts may be machined from rolled bar or \nseamless tubular materials provided the longitudinal axis of the \npart is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bar. Other parts, \nup to and including NPS4, may be machined from hot-rolled or \nforged bar provided the longitudinal axis of the part is parallel \nto the longitudinal axis of the bar. Flanges, elbows, return \nbends, tees, and header tees shall not be machined directly \nfrom bar stock. \n5.4 Heat Treatment: \n5.4.1 After hot working and before reheating for heat \ntreatment, the forging shall be allowed to cool substantially \nbelow the transformation range. \n5.4.2 Forgings of grades other than Grade LF787 shall be \nfurnished in the normalized, or normalized and tempered, or \nquenched and tempered condition. At the option of the \nmanufacturer, forgings furnished in the quenched and tempered \ncondition may be normalized prior to the austenitize/quench \noperation. \n5.4.2.1 Quenching shall consist of either: \n( 1) fully austenitizing the forgings followed by quenching \nin a suitable liquid medium, or . \n(2) using a multiple stage procedure whereby the forging is \nfirst fully austenitized and rapidly cooled, then reheated to \npartially re-asutenitize, followed by quenching in a suitable \nliquid medium. \n( 3) Unless otherwise specified by the purchaser, the choice \nof (J) or (2) shall be at the option of the manufacturer. \n5.4.2.2 All quenched forgings shall be tempered to 5.4.2.3 \n5.4.2.3 Forgings, when tempered, shall be tempered at \n1100 \u00b0F [590 \u00b0C], minimum, holding at temperature a mini\u00ad\nmum of 30 min/in. [30 min/25 mm] of maximum thickness, but \nin no case less than 30 min. \n5.4.3 Grade LF787 forgings shall be furnished in either the \nnormalized-and-precipitation heat treated condition or in the \nquenched-and-precipitation heat treated condition. The heat \ntreatment procedures shall be as follows: \n5.4.3.1 Normalized-and-Precipitation Heat Treated\u00ad\nAustenitize in the range from 1600 to 1725 \u00b0F [870 to 940 \u00b0C] \nTABLE 1 Chemical Requirements \nElement \nComposition, wt % \nGrade LF1 Grade LF2 Grade LF3 Grade LF5 Grade LF6 \nCarbon, max 0.30 0.30 0.20 0.30 0.22 \nManganese 0.60-1.35 0.60-1.35 0.90 max 0.60-1.35 1.15-1.50 \nPhosphorus, 0.035 0.035 0.035 0.035 0.025 \nmax \nSulfur, max 0.040 0.040 0.040 0.040 0.025 \nSiliconA 0.15-0.30 0.15-0.30 0.20-0.35 0.20-0.35 0.15-0.30 \nNickel 0.40 max 8 0.40 max 8 3.3-3.7 1.0-2.0 0.40 max 8 \n\u00b7Chromium 0.30 max 8 \u00b7c 0.30 max 8 \u2022 0 0.30 max 0 0.30 max 0 0.30 max 8 \u2022 0 \nMolybdenum 0.12 max 8 \u2022 0 0.12 max 8 \u2022 0 0.12 max 0 0.12 maxc 0.12 max 8 \u2022 0 \nCopper 0.40 max 8 0.40 max 8 0.40 max 0.40 max 0.40 max 8 \nNiobiumE 0.02 max 0 0.02 max 0 0.02 max 0.02 max 0.02 max \nVanadium 0.08 max 0.08 max 0.03 max 0.03 max 0.04-Q,11 \nNitrogen 0.01-0.030 \nA When vacuum carbon-deoxidation is required by Supplementary Requirement S4, the silicon content shall be 0.12 % maximum. \n8 The sum of copper, nickel, chromium, vanadium and molybdenum shall not exceed 1.00 % on heat analysis. \n0 The sum of chromium and molybdenum shall not exceed 0.32 % on heat analysis. \nGrade LF9 \n0.20 \n0.40-1.06 \n0.035 \n0.040 \n1,60-2.24 \n0.30 max 0 \n0.12 max 0 \n0.75-1.25 \n0.02 max \n0.03 max \n0 By agreement, the limit for niobium (columbium) may be increased up to 0.05 % on heat analysis and 0.06 % on product analysis. \nE Niobium and columbium are interchangeable names for the same element and both names are acceptable for use in A01.22 specifications. \n529 \nGrade LF787 \n0.07 \n0.40-0.70 \n0.025 \n0.025 \n0.40 max \n0.70-1.00 \n0,60-0.90 \n0.15-0,25 \n1.00-1.30 \n0.02 min \n0.03 max ",
