General Requirements \n4.1 Material furnished to this specification shall conform to \nthe applicable requirements of the current edition of Specifi\u00ad\ncation A530/ A530M unless otherwise provided herein. \n5. Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 Process: \n5.1.1 The steel shall be killed steel made by one or more of \nthe following processes: electric-furnace, basic-oxygen, or any \nother commercially viable process. \n5.1.2 The steel shall be made to fine grain practice. \n5.1.3 Steel may be cast in ingots or may be strand cast. \nWhen steel of different grades are sequentially strand cast, \nidentification of the resultant transition material is required. \nThe producer shall remove the transition material by any \nestablished procedure that positively separates the grades. \n5.1.4 Pipe NPS 1 \u00bd [DN 40] and under may be either hot \nfinished or cold drawn. \n5.1.5 Unless otherwise specified, pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] and \nover shall be furnished hot finished. When agreed upon \nbetween the manufacturer and purchaser, cold-drawn pipe may \nbe furnished. \n5.2 Heat Treatment-All hot-finished and cold-drawn pipe \nshall be reheated to a temperature above 1550\u00b0F [845\u00b0C] and \nfollowed by cooling in air or in the cooling chamber of a \ncontrolled atmosphere furnace. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical requirements \nprescribed in Table 1. \n7. Heat Analysis \n7.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the \nsteel manufacturer to determine the percentages of the ele\u00ad\nments specified in Section 6. The chemical composition thus \ndetermined, or that determined from a product analysis made \nby the manufacturer, if the latter has not manufactured the \nsteel, shall be reported to the purchaser or the purchaser's \nrepresentative, and shall conform to the requirements specified \nin Section 6. \n8. Product Analysis \n8.1 At the request of the purchaser, analyses of two pipes \nfrom each lot (Note 2) shall be made by the manufacturer from \nthe finished pipe. The chemical composition thus determined \nshall conform to the requirements specified in Section 6. \nNorn 2-A lot shall consist of 400 lengths, or fraction thereof, for each \nsize NPS 2 [DN 50] up to but not including NPS 6 [DN 150], and of 200 \nlengths, or fraction thereof, for each size NPS 6 [DN 150] and over. \n8.2 If the analysis of one of the tests specified in 8.1 does \nnot conform to the requirements specified in Section 6, \nanalyses shall be made on additional pipe of double the original \nnumber from the same lot, each of which shall conform to \nrequirements specified. \n9. Physical Properties \n9.l Tensile Properties-The material shall conform to the \nrequirements as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. \n9.2 Bending Properties: \n9.2.1 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] and under, a sufficient length \nof pipe shall stand being bent cold through 90\u00b0 around a \ncylindrical mandrel, the diameter of which is twelve times the \nnominal diameter of the pipe, without developing cracks. \nWhen ordered for close coiling, the pipe shall stand being bent \ncold through 180\u00b0 around a cylindrical mandrel, the diameter \nof which is eight times the nominal diameter of the pipe, \nwithout failure. \n9.2.2 For pipe whose diameter exceeds 25 in. [635 mm] and \nwhose diameter to wall thickness ratio is 7.0 or less, bend test \nspecimens shall be bent at room temperature through 180\u00b0 \nwithout cracking on the outside of the bent portion. The inside \ndiameter of the bend shall be 1 in. [25 .4 mm]. This test shall be \nin place of Section 10. \nNorn 3-Diameter to wall thickness ratio = specified outside diameter/ \nnominal wall thickness. \nExample: For 28 in. [710 mm] diameter 5.000 in. [125 mm] thick pipe the \ndiameter to wall thickness ratio = 28/5 = 5.6. \n10. Flattening Test Requirements \n10.1 For pipe over NPS 2 [DN 50], a section of pipe not less \nthan 2\u00bd in. [63.5 mm] in length shall be flattened cold between \nparallel plates until the opposite walls of the pipe meet. \nFlattening tests shall be in accordance with Specification \nA530/A530M, except that in the equation used to calculate the \nH~valu8,th?-foll~wing~ constants shall be used: \n887 \n0.07 for Grade I \n0.08 for Grade II \n10.2 When low D-to-t ratio tubulars are tested, because the \nstrain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the \ninside smface at the 6 and 12 o'clock locations, cracks at these \nlocations shall not be cause for rejection if the D-to-t ratio is \nless than ten. \n11. Hydrostatic Test Requirements \n11.1 Each length of pipe shall be subjected to the hydro\u00ad\nstatic pressure, except as provided in 11.2. \n11.2 When specified in the order, pipe may be furnished \nwithout hydrostatic testing and each length so furnished shall \ninclude with the mandatory marking the letters \"NH.\" \n11.3 When certification is required by the purchaser and the \nhydrostatic test has been omitted, the certification shall clearly ",
