General Requirements and Ordering Information \n3.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to \nthe requirements of Specification A961/A961M, including any \nsupplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase \norder. Failure to comply with the requirements of Specification \nA961/A961M constitutes nonconformance with this specifica\u00ad\ntion. In case of a conflict between the requirements of this \nspecification and Specification A961/A961M, this specification \nshall prevail. \n3.2 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the \npurchase order all ordering information necessary to purchase \nthe needed material. Examples of such information include but \nare not limited to the following: \n3.2.1 Additional requirements (see 16.1). \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 The steel shall be made by one or more of the following \nprocesses: open-hearth, basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace, and \nshall be fully killed, fine-grain practice. \n4.2 Forgings shall be manufactured froni ingots, blooms, \nbillets, slabs, or bars. These items shall be forged, rolled, or \nstrandcast. \n4.3 A sufficient discard shall be made from the ingot to \nsecure freedom from injurious piping and undue segregation. \n4.4 The finished product shall be a forging as defined by the \nTerminology section of Specification A788/A788M. \n5. Heat Treatment \n5.1 Following plastic working, the forging manufacturer \nshall heat treat the forgings by normalizing, or normalizing and \ntempering, or quenching and tempering. \n5.1.1 Normalizing-The procedure for normalizing shall \nconsist of uniformly heating the forgings to a temperature \nbetween 1550 and 1700 \u00b0F [845 and 925 \u00b0C], holding a \nsufficient time to attain uniform temperature throughout, and \ncooling in still air. The forging shall be at a temperature below \n1000 \u00b0F [540 \u00b0C] before heating for normalizing. \n5.1.2 Quenching-The procedure for quenching shall con\u00ad\nsist of uniformly heating the forging to a temperature between \n1550 and 1700 \u00b0P [845 and 925 \u00b0C], holding a sufficient time \nto attain uniform temperature throughout, and quenching into a \nsuitable liquid medium. The forging shall be at a temperature \nbelow 1000 \u00b0F [540 \u00b0C] before heating for quenching. \n5 .1.3 Tempering-The procedure for tempering shall consist \nof reheating the forging subsequent to normalizing or quench\u00ad\ning to a temperature of at least 1100 \u00b0P [595 \u00b0C], but not above \nthe lower transformation temperature, for 30 min/in. [30 \nmin/25 mm] of maximum section thickness, with minimum \nholding time at tempering temperature not less than 30 min. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to \nchemical composition prescribed in Table 1. \n6.2 Steels to which lead has been added shall not be used. \n7. Mechanical Requirements \n7.1 Tension Tests: \n7. I. I Requirements-The material shall conform to require\u00ad\nments for tensile properties prescribed in Table 2. \n7 .1.1.1 The test specimen shall be obtained from a rough or \nfinished production forging, or prolongation thereof, or it may \nbe obtained from separately forged test blanks from the same \nheat of steel as the production forging. The test blank shall be \nreduced by forging in a manner similar to that for the products \nrepresented, shall receive approximately the same hot working \nand reduction, be of the same nominal thickness, and receive \nthe same heat treatment as the finished products represented. \nThe test material shall be treated in the same furnace at the \nsame time as the forging it represents, subject to the require\u00ad\nments of 7 .1.2.1. \nTABLE 1 Chemical Requirements \nElements Composition, % \nCarbon \nHeat Analysis 0.25 max \nProduct Analysis 0.28 max \nManganese \nHeat Analysis 0.90 to 1.35 \nProduct Analysis 0.84 to 1.41 \nPhosphorus \nHeat Analysis 0.035 max \nProduct Analysis 0.043 max \nSulfur \nHeat Analysis 0.025 max \nProduct Analysis 0.033 max \nSilicon \nHeat Analysis 0.15 to 0.30 \nProduct Analysis 0.13 to 0.32 \nNickel \nHeat Analysis 0.40A \nProduct Analysis 0.43 \nChromium \nHeat Analysis 0.3QA\u2022 8 \nProduct Analysis 0.34 \nMolybdenum \nHeat Analysis 0.12A.B \nProduct Analysis 0.13 \nCopper \nHeat Analysis 0.40A \nProduct Analysis 0.43 \nNiobium (Nb)c \nHeat Analysis 0.02 \nProduct Analysis 0.03 \nVanadium \nHeat Analysis 0.05 \nProduct Analysis 0.055 \nA The sum of copper, nickel, chromium and molybdenum shall not exceed 1.00 % \non heat analysis. \n8 The sum of chromium and molybdenum shall not exceed 0.32 % on heat \nanalysis. \nc Niobium and columbium are interchangeable names for the same element and \nboth names are acceptable for use in A01.22 specifications. \n1189 ",
