ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-106/SA-106M 
19.1.1 NPS l½ [DN 40] and Smaller-All walls shall be 
either plain-end square cut, or plain-end beveled at the option 
of the manufacturer. 
19.1.2 NPS 2 [DN 50] and Larger-Walls through extra 
strong weights, shall be plain-end-beveled. 
19.1.3 NPS 2 [DN 50] and Larger-Walls over extra strong 
weights, shall be plain-end square cut. 
19.2 Plain-end beveled pipe shall be plain-end pipe having 
a bevel angle of 30°, + 5° or - 0°, as measured from a line 
drawn perpendicular to the axis of the pipe with a root face of 
1/16 ± 1/32 in. [1.6 ± 0.8 mm]. Other bevel angles may be 
specified by agreement between the purchaser and the manu­
facturer. 
20. Sampling 
20.1 For product analysis (see 9.1) and tensile tests (see 
21.1), a lot is the number of lengths of the same size and wall 
thickness from any one heat of steel; of 400 lengths or fraction 
thereof, of each size up to, but not including, NPS 6 [DN 150]; 
and of 200 lengths or fraction thereof of each size NPS 6 [DN 
150] and over. 
20.2 For bend tests (see 21.2), a lot is the number of lengths 
of the same size and wall thickness from any one heat of steel, 
of 400 lengths or fraction thereof, of each size. 
20.3 For flattening tests, a lot is the number of lengths of the 
same size and wall thickness from any one heat of steel, of 400 
lengths or fraction thereof of each size over NPS 2 [DN 50], up 
to but not including NPS 6 [DN 150], and of 200 lengths or 
fraction thereof, of each size NPS 6 [DN 150] and over. 
21. Number of Tests 
21.1 The tensile requirements specified in Section 10 shall 
be determined on one length of pipe from each lot (see 20.1). 
21.2 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] and under, the bend test 
specified in 11.1 shall be made on one pipe from each lot ( see 
20.2). The bend test, where used as required by 11.2, shall be 
made on one end of 5 % of the pipe from each lot. For small 
lots, at least one pipe shall be tested. 
21.3 If any test specimen shows flaws or defective 
machining, it shall be permissible to discard it and substitute 
another test specimen. 
22. Retests 
22.1 If the percentage of· elongation of any tension test 
specimen is less than that given in Table 1 and any part of the 
fracture is more than ¾ in. [19 mm] from the center of the 
gauge length of a 2-in. [50-mm] specimen as indicated by 
scribe scratches marked on the specimen before testing, a retest 
shall be allowed. If a specimen breaks in an inside or outside 
surface flaw, a retest shall be allowed. 
23. Test Specimens and Test Methods 
23.1 On NPS 8 [DN 200] and larger, specimens cut either 
longitudinally or transversely shall be acceptable for the 
tension test. On sizes smaller than NPS 8 [DN 200], the 
longitudinal test only shall be used. 
23.2 When round tension test specimens are used for pipe 
wall thicknesses over 1.0 in. [25.4 mm], the mid-length of the 
longitudinal axis of such test specimens shall be from a 
location midway between the inside and outside surfaces of the 
pipe. 
23 .3 Test specimens for the bend test specified in Section 11 
and for the flattening tests shall consist of sections cut from a 
pipe. Specimens for flattening tests shall be smooth on the ends 
and free from burrs, except when made on crop ends. 
23.4 Test specimens for the bend test specified in 11.2 shall 
be cut from one end of the pipe and, unless otherwise specified, 
shall be taken in a transverse direction. One test specimen shall 
be taken as close to the outer surface as possible and another 
from as close to the inner surface as possible. The specimens 
shall be either½ by½ in. [12.5 by 12.5 mm] in section or 1 by 
½ in. [25 by 12.5 mm] in section with the corners rounded to 
a radius not over 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] and need not exceed 6 in. 
[150 mm] in length. The side of the samples placed in tension 
during the bend shall be the side closest to the inner and outer 
surface of the pipe respectively. 
23.5 All routine check tests shall be made at room tempera­
ture. 
23.6 All tests shall be performed after the heat treatments 
permitted by 5.1 or required by 5.2. 
24. Certification 
24.1 In the required test report(s), in addition to the require­
ments of Specification A530/A530M, the producer or supplier 
shall furnish to the purchaser a chemical analysis report for the 
elements specified in Table 1. 
25. Product Marking 
25.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification 
A530/A530M, the marking shall include heat number, the 
information as per Table 4, an additional symbol "S" if one or 
more of the supplementary requirements apply; the length, OD 
1 %, if ordered as special outside diameter tolerance pipe; ID 
1 %, if ordered as special inside diameter tolerance pipe; the 
schedule number, weight class, or nominal wall thickness; and, 
for sizes larger than NPS 4 [DN 100], the weight. Length shall 
be marked in feet and tenths of a foot [metres to two decimal 
places], depending on the units to which the material was 
ordered, or other marking subject to agreement. For sizes NPS 
1 ½, 1 ¼, 1, and¾ [DN 40, 32, 25, and 20], each length shall 
be marked as prescribed in Specification A530/A530M. These 
sizes shall be bundled in accordance with standard mill practice 
and the total bundle footage marked on the bundle tag; 
individual lengths of pipe need not be marked with footage. 
For sizes less than NPS % [DN 20], all the required markings 
shall be on the bundle tag or on each length of pipe and shall
