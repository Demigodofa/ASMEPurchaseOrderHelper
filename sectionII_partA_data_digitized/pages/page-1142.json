A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers killed carbon-manganese\u00ad\nsilicon steel plates intended for welded pressure vessels in \nservice at moderate and lower temperatures. \n1.2 The maximum thiclrness of plates is limited only by the \ncapacity of the material to meet the specified mechanical \nproperty requirements. \n1.3 For plates produced from coil and furnished without \nheat treatment or with stress relieving only, the additional \nrequirements, including additional testing requirements and the \nreporting of additional test results, of Specification A20/ A20M \napply. \n1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must \nbe used independently of the other. Combining values from the \ntwo systems may result in nonconformance with the specifi\u00ad\ncation. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: 3 \nA20/A20M Specification for General Requirements for Steel \nPlates for Pressure Vessels \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO 1 on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.11 on Steel Plates for Boilers and Pressure Vessels. \nCurrent edition approved May 1, 2020. Published May 2020. Originally \napproved in 1970. Last previous edition approved in 2019 as A612/A612M-12 \n(2019). DOI: 10.1520/A0612_A0612M-20. \n2 For ASME Boiler a11d Pressure Vessel Code applications see related Specifi\u00ad\ncation SA-612/SA-612M in Section II of that Code. \n3 For referenced ASTM standards, visit the ASTM website, www.astm.org, or \ncontact ASTM Customer Service at service@astm.org.

General Requirements and Ordering Information \n3.1 Material supplied to this product specification shall \nconform to Specification A20/A20M. These requirements out\u00ad\nline the testing and retesting methods and procedures, permit\u00ad\nted variations in dimensions and mass, quality and repair of \ndefects, marking, loading, and ordering information. \n3 .2 In addition to the basic requirements of this \nspecification, certain supplementary requirements are available \nwhere additional control, testing, or examination is required to \nmeet end use requirements. The purchaser is referred to the \nlisted supplementary requirements in this specification and to \nthe detailed requirements in Specification A20/ A20M. \n3.3 Coils are excluded from qualification to this specifica\u00ad\ntion until they are processed into finished plates. Plates \nproduced from coil means plates that have been cut to \nindividual lengths from coil. The processor directly controls, or \nis responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of \ncoils into finished plates. Such operations include decoiling, \nleveling, cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, \nheat treatment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for \nshipment, and certification. \nNow 1-For plates produced from coil and furnished without heat \ntreatment or with stress relieving only, three test results are reported for \neach qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding plates from coil \nare described in Specification A20/A20M. \n3 .4 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A20/ A20M, the require\u00ad\nments of this specification shall prevail. \n4. Materials and Mannfacture \n4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and \nshall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of \nSpecification A20/A20M. \n* A Summary of Changes section appears at the end of this standard \n1048 ",
