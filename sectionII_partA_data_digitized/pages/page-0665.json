If the properties meet the minimum requirements specified, no further testing is required, but if they are less than the minimum requirements, \ndiscard the test and retest. \nNorn ?-Specimen 5 is intended for testing specimens removed from an in-service product. Specimen 5 shall not be used for conformance testing of \nnew product. Acceptance criteria for elongation values obtained from 1 in. gauge length specimens shall be determined by agreement between the \nresponsible parties. \nFIG.

A2.4 Location of Transverse Tension Test Specimens in \nRing Cut from Tubular Products. \nthrough the pressure line under the control of a suitable valve. \nAn accurately calibrated pressure gauge serves to measure oil \npressure. Any air in the system is removed through the bleeder \nline. As the oil pressure is increased, the rubber gasket expands \nwhich in turn stresses the specimen circumferentially. As the \npressure builds up, the lips of the rubber gasket act as a seal to \nprevent oil leakage. With continued increase in pressure, the \nring specimen is subjected to a tension stress and elongates \naccordingly. The entire outside circumference of the ring \nspecimen is considered as the gauge length and the strain is \nmeasured with a suitable extensometer which will be described \nlater. When the desired total strain or extension under load is \nreached on the extensometer, the oil pressure in pounds per \nsquare inch is read and by employing Barlow's formula, the \nunit yield strength is calculated. The yield strength, thus \ndetermined, is a true result since the test specimen has not been \n613 \n3\"Mln \nRad 1\" Min \nNorn 1-The dimension t is the thickness of the test specimen as \nprovided for in the applicable material specifications. \nNorn 2-The reduced section shall be parallel within 0.010 in. and may \nhave a gradual taper in width from the ends toward the center, with the \nends not more than 0.010 in. wider than the center. \nNorn 3-The ends of the specimen shall be symmetrical with the center \nline of the reduced section within 0.10 in. \nNorn 4-Metric equivalent: 1 in. = 25.6 mm. \nFIG.

Further, \nthe test closely simulates service conditions in pipe lines. One \ntesting machine unit may be used for several different sizes of \npipe by the use of suitable rubber gaskets and adapters. \nNorn A2.3-Barlow's formula may be stated two ways: ",
