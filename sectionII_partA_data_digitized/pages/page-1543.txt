ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-999 /SA-999M 
10.1.1 Minimum Wall-If the wall thickness of the pipe is 
specified as minimum wall in the purchase order, there shall be 
no variation under the specified wall thickness. 
10.2 Forged and Bored-The wall thickness shall not vary 
over that specified by more than Vs in. [3.2 mm]. There shall be 
no variation under the specified wall thickness. 
10.3 Cast-The wall thickness shall not vary over that 
specified by more than V16 in. [1.6 mm]. There shall be no 
variation under the specified wall thickness. 
11. Permissible Variations in Inside Diameter 
11.1 Forged and Bored, and Cast-The inside diameter 
shall not vary under that specified by more than V16 in. [1.6 
mm]. There shall be no variation over the specified inside 
diameter. 
12. Permissible Variation in Outside Diameter 
12.1 Variations in outside diameter, unless otherwise agreed 
upon, shall not exceed the limits given in Table I. The 
tolerances for outside diameter include ovality, except as 
provided for in 12.2 and 12.2.1. (See Note 2.) 
12.2 For thin-wall pipe, defined as pipe having a wall 
thickness of 3 % or less of the specified outside diameter, the 
diameter tolerance of Table 1 is applicable only to the mean of 
the extreme (maximum and minimum) outside diameter read­
ings in any one cross-section. 
12.2.1 For thin-wall pipe, the difference in extreme outside 
readings (ovality) in any one cross-section shall not exceed 
1.5 % of the specified outside diameter. 
Norn 2-Thin-wall pipe usually develops significant ovality (out-of­
roundness) during final annealing, straightening, or both. The diameter 
tolerances given in Table 1 are usually not sufficient to provide for 
additional ovality expected in thin-wall pipe. 
13. Permissible Variations in Length 
13.1 Seamless and Welded (No Filler Metal Added)-If 
specific cut lengths of 24 ft [7.3 m] or less are ordered, no 
length of pipe shall be under the length specified or more than 
¼ in. [6 mm] over that specified. 
13.1.1 Permissible variations in length for lengths greater 
than 24 ft [7.3 m] shall be subject to agreement between the 
manufacturer and purchaser. 
13.2 Forged and Bored, Cast, and Cast Cold-Wrought-If 
specific cut lengths are ordered, no length of pipe shall be 
under the length specified or more than 1/s in. [3 mm] over that 
specified. 
13.3 For pipe ordered to random lengths, the lengths and 
variations shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and 
purchaser. 
13.4 No girth welds are permitted unless agreed upon by the 
manufacturer and purchaser. 
14. Mass per Unit Length 
14.1 A system of standard pipe sizes has been approved by 
the American National Standards Institute as ANSI B36.10 and 
B36.19. The standard sizes do not prohibit the production and 
use of other sizes of pipe produced to the various product 
specifications referenced in 1.1. (See Note 3.) 
14.2 For nonstandard sizes of pipe, the calculated mass per 
unit length shall be determined using the following equation: 
M= C(D - t)t (1) 
where: 
C = 10.69 [0.0246615], 
M = mass per unit length, lbm/ft [kg/m], 
D = specified or calculated (from specified inside diameter 
and wall thickness) outside diameter, in. [mm], and 
t = specified wall thickness, in. (to 3 decimal places) [mm 
to 2 decimal places]. 
14.3 When minimum wall thickness is specified in the 
purchase order, the calculated mass per unit length shall be 
determined using Eq 1, obtaining from Table Xl.l the nominal 
wall thickness, t, corresponding to that minimum wall. 
Norn 3-The mass per unit length values given in the American 
National Standards and the calculated masses per unit length determined 
using Eq 1 are based upon carbon steel pipe. The mass per unit length of 
pipe made of ferritic stainless steels may be up to about 5 % less, and that 
made of austeilitic stainless steel up to about 2 % greater, than the values 
given. 
15. Ends 
15.1 Unless otherwise specified, the pipe shall be furnished 
with plain ends. All burrs at the ends of the pipe shall be 
removed. 
16. Straightness 
16.1 The finished pipe shall be reasonably straight. 
16.2 For metal-arc welded pipe, the maximum deviation 
from a 10-ft [3.0-m] straightedge placed so that both ends are 
in contact with the pipe shall be Vs in. [3.2 mm]. For metal-arc 
welded pipe with lengths shorter than 10 ft [3.0 m], this 
maximum deviation shall be prorated with respect to the ratio 
of the actual length to 10 ft [3.0 m].
