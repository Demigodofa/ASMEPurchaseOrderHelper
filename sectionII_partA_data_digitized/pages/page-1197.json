Terminology \n3 .1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.1.1 A lot shall consist of 200 ft [60 m] or fraction thereof \nof pipe from the same heat of steel. \n3.1.2 The description of a lot may be further restricted by \nuse of Supplementary Requirement S14. \n4. Ordering Information \n4.1 The inquiry and order for material under this specifica-\ntion should include the following information: \n4.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number oflengths), \n4.1.2 Name of material (steel pipe, electric-fusionwelded), \n4.1.3 Specification number, \n4.1.4 Grade and class designations (see 1.3), \n4.1.5 Size (inside or outside diameter, nominal or minimum \nwall thickness), \n4.1.6 Length (specific or random), \n4.1.7 End finish (11.4), \n4.1.8 Purchase options, if any (see 5.2.3, 11.3, 14.1 and \nSections 16, 20.1, 21, 22 of Specification A530/A530M), and \n4.1.9 Supplementary requirements, if any (refer to Sl \nthrough S15). \n5. Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 Materials-The steel plate material shall conform to the \nrequirements of the applicable plate specification for pipe \ngrade ordered as listed in Table 1. \n5.2 Welding: \n5.2.1 The joints shall be double-welded, full-penetration \nwelds made in accordance with procedures and by welders or \nwelding operators qualified in accordance with the ASME \nBoiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX. \n5.2.2 The welds shall be made either manually or automati\u00ad\ncally by an electric process involving the deposition of filler \nmetal. \n5.2.3 The welded joint shall have positive reinforcement at \nthe center of each side of the weld, but not more than 1/s in. [3 \nmm]. This reinforcement may be removed at the manufactur\u00ad\ner's option or by agreement between the manufacturer and \npurchaser. The contour of the reinforcement shall be smooth, \nand the deposited metal shall be fused smoothly and uniformly \ninto the plate surface. \n5.2.4 When radiographic examination in accordance with \n9.1 is to be used, the weld reinfor~ement shall be governed by \nthe more restrictive provisions of UW-51 of Section VIII of \nthe ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code instead of 5.2.3 of \nthis specification. \n5.3 Heat Treatment-All classes other than 10, 11, 12 and \n13 shall be heat treated in furnace controlled to \u00b1 25 \u00b0F [15 \n\u00b0C] and equipped with a recording pyrometer so that heating \nrecords are available. Heat treating after forming and welding \nshall be to one of the following: \u2022 \n5.3.1 Classes 20, 21, 22, and 23 pipe shall be uniformly \nheated within the post-weld heat-treatment temperature range \nindicated in Table 2 for a minimum of 1 h/in. [0.4 hr/cm] of \nthickness or 1 h, whichever is greater. \n5.3.2 Classes 30, 31, 32, and 33 pipe shall be uniformly \nheated to a temperature in the austenitizing range and not \nexceeding the maximum normalizing temperature indicated in \nTable 2 and subsequently cooled in air at room temperature. \n5.3.3 Classes 40, 41, 42, and 43 pipe shall be normalized in \naccordance with 5.3.2. After normalizing, the pipe shall be \nreheated to the tempering temperature indicated in Table 2 as a \nminimum and held at temperature for a minimum of \u00bd h/2n. \n[0.2 hr/cm] of thickness or \u00bd h, whichever is greater, and air \ncooled. \n5.3.4 Classes 50, 51, 52, and 53 pipe shall be uniformly \nheated to a temperature in the austenitizing range, and not \nexceeding\u00b7 the maximum quenching temperature indicated in \nTable 2 and subsequently quenched in water or oil. After \nquenching the pipe shall be reheated to the tempering tempera\u00ad\nture indicated in Table 2 as a minimum and held at temperature \nfor a minimum of \u00bd h/2n. [0.2 hr/cm] of thickness or \u00bd h, \nwhichever is greater, and air cooled. \n1107 ",
