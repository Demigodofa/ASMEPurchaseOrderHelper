Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for externally threaded fasteners (including nuts \nand accessories) under this specification shall include the \nfollowing: \n3.1.1 ASTM designation and year of issue, \n3.1.2 Name of product, bolts or studs; and bolt head style, \nthat is, hex or heavy hex, \n3.1.3 Grade, that is, A, or\u00b7B. If no grade is specified, Grade \nA is furnished. \n3.1.4 Quantities (number of pieces by size including nuts), \n3 .1.5 Fastener size and length, \n3.1.6 Washers-Quantity and size (separate from bolts), \n3.1.7 Zinc Coating-Specify the zinc-coating process re-\nquired, for example, hot-dip, mechanically deposited, or no \npreference (see 4.5). \n3.1.8 Other Finishes-Specify other protective finish, if \nrequired. \n3.1.9 Specify if inspection at point of manufacture is re\u00ad\nquired, \n3.1.10 Specify if certified test report is required (see 8.2), \nand \n3.1.11 Specify additional testing (8.3) or special require\u00ad\nments. \n3.1.12 For establishment of a pait identifying system, see \nASME Bl8.24. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Steel for bolts and studs shall be made by the open\u00ad\nhearth, basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace process. \n4.2 Bolts shall be produced by hot or cold forging of the \nheads or machining from bar stock. \n4.3 Heat Treatment: \n4.3.1 Cold headed fasteners with head configurations other \nthan hex having a minimum head height less than or equal to \n.5 D (D is nominal diameter) shall be stress relief annealed at \na minimum temperature of 875\u00b0F. \n4.3.2 Stress relieving of hex head fasteners and those with \nminimum head heights greater than .5 D shall be at the \nmanufacturer's option. \n4.4 Bolt and stud threads shall be rolled or cut. \n4.5 Zinc Coatings, Hot-Dip and Mechanically Deposited: \n4.5.1 When zinc-coated fasteners are required, the pur-\nchaser shall specify the zinc-coating process, for example hot \ndip, mechanically deposited, or no preference. \n4.5.2 When hot-dip is specified, the fasteners shall be \nzinc-coated by the hot-dip process in accordance with the \nrequirements of Specification F2329. \n4.5.3 When mechanically deposited is specified, the fasten\u00ad\ners shall be zinc-coated by the mechanical-deposition process \nin accordance with the requirements of Class 55 of Specifica\u00ad\ntion B695. \n4.5.4 When no preference is specified, the supplier may \nfurnish either a hot-dip zinc coating in accordance with \nSpecification F2329, or a mechanically deposited zinc coating \nin accordance with Specification B695, Class 55. Threaded \ncomponents (bolts and nuts) shall be coated by the same \nzinc-coating process and the supplier's option is limited to one \nprocess per item with no mixed processes in a lot. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5 .1 Grade A and B bolts and studs shall have a heat analysis \nconforming to the requirements specified in Table 1 based on \nthe steel producer's heat analysis. \n5.2 The purchaser shall have the option of conducting \nproduct analyses on finished bolts in each lot, which shall \nconform to the product analysis specified in Table l. \n5.3 In case of conflict or for referee purposes, the product \nanalysis shall take precedence. \n5.4 Bolts and studs are customarily furnished from stock, in \nwhich case individual heats of steel cannot be identified. \n5.5 Application of heats of steel to which bismuth, sele\u00ad\nnium, tellurium, or lead has been intentionally added shall not \nbe permitted for Grade B bolts and studs. \n5.6 Chemical analyses shall be performed in accordance \nwith Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751. \n6. Mechanical Properties \n6.1 Grades A and B bolts and studs shall conform to the \nhardness specified in Table 2. \n6.2 Grade A and B bolts and studs 1 \u00bd in. in diameter or less, \nother than those excepted in 6.4, shall be tested full size and \nshall conform to the requirements for tensile strength specified \nin Table 3. \n441 \n6.3 Grade A and B bolts and studs larger than 1 \u00bd in. in \ndiameter, other than those excepted in 6.4, shall preferably be \ntested full size and when equipment of sufficient capacity is \navailable and shall conform to the requirements for tensile \nstrength specified in Table 3. When equipment of sufficient \ncapacity for full-size bolt testing is not available, or when the \nlength of the bolt makes full-size testing impractical, machined \nspecimens shall be tested and shall conform to the require\u00ad\nments specified in Table 4. \nTABLE 1 Chemical Requirements for Grades A and B Bolts and \nStuds \nCarbon, max \nManganese, max \nPhosphorus, max \nSulfur, max \nGrade A \nGrade B \nHeat Analysis \n0.29 \n1.20 \n0.04 \n0.15 \n0.05 \nProduct Analysis \n0.33 \n1.25 \n0.041 \nA \n0.051 \nA Resulfurized steel is not subject to rejection based on product analysis for \nsulfur.
