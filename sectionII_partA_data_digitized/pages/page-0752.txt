as shown in Table 2, unless the purchaser has otherwise 
specified in the order. 
8. Chemical Composition 
8 .1 The steel shall conform to requirements of chemical 
composition for the respective material prescribed in Table 1. 
8.2 The steel shall not contain any unspecified elements for 
the ordered grade to the extent that it then conforms to the 
requirements of another grade for which that element is a 
specified element having a required minimum content. 
8.3 The chemical composition of weld metal is not required 
to meet the same limits of the base materials however, the 
composition of the weld deposit shall be such that it meets the 
minimum mechanical and impact requirements of this specifi­
cation. In general, the alloy content shall be similar to that of 
the base metal but shall not exceed 6 % except in the case of 
fittings of 9 % nickel steel. 
8.4 A product analysis is optional. 
9. Tensile Properties 
9 .1 The tensile properties of the fittings material shall 
conform to the requirements for the applicable grade of 
material as listed in Table 3. 
9 .1.1 Longitudinal or transverse specimens cut from either 
a fitting or from starting plate or pipe they were manufactured 
from shall be acceptable for the tension test. For fittings made 
from forgings, the test specimen shall meet the requirements of 
Specification A350/ A350M for the tension test. 
9.1.2 While Table 3 specifies elongation requirements for 
both longitudinal and transverse specimens, it is not the intent 
that both requirements apply simultaneously. Instead, it is 
intended that only the elongation requirement that is appropri­
ate for the specimen used be applicable. Unless specified by the 
customer, tensile test orientation is at the discretion of the 
manufacturer. 
9.2 At least one tension test shall be made on each heat of 
material and in the same condition of heat treatment as the 
finished fittings it represents provided that the wall thickness of 
the fitting and the representative sample thickness do not vary 
more than ¼ in. [6 mm]. At least one tension test per heat of 
weld metal shall be made after heat treatment in the same 
manner as the base metal. Results of the tension test of the 
weld metal need not be reported unless Supplementary Re­
quirement S51 of Specification A960/A960M is specified.

9 .3 Records of the tension tests shall be certification that the 
material of the fitting meets the tensile requirements of this 
specification. 
10. Impact Test Properties 
10. I Properties: 
10.1.1 The notched bar impact properties of the base metal 
and weld metal shall conform to the requirements of Table 4 or 
Table 5 for the applicable grade of material. 
10.1.2 Retest-When the average value of the three speci­
mens equals or exceeds the minimum value permitted for a 
single specimen and the value for more than one specimen is 
below the required average value, or when the value for one 
specimen is below the minimum value permitted for a single 
specimen, a retest of three additional specimens shall be made. 
The value for each of these retest specimens shall equal or 
exceed the required average value. When an erratic result is 
caused by a defective specimen, or there is uncertainty in test 
procedure, a retest shall be allowed. 
10.2 Procedures: 
10.2.1 All material furnished under this specification shall 
be tested for impact resistance at the temperature for the 
respective grade in Table 6. Exceptions to these requirements 
are permissible when agreed upon between the purchaser and 
producer and specified in the order, in that the impact test is 
acceptable when made at temperatures different from those 
shown in Table 6, provided the test temperature is at least as 
low as the intended service temperature, and fittings are 
suitably marked in accordance with Section 19 to identify the 
reported test temperature. 
10.2.2 The notched-bar impact test shall be made in accor­
dance with the procedure for the simple-beam, Charpy-type 
test of Test Methods and Definitions A370 if the inch-pound 
units are specified or Test Methods Al058 if the M suffix (SI 
units) standard is specified. Each impact test shall consist of 
breaking three specimens. 
10.3 Specimens: 
10.3.1 Notched-bar impact specimens shall be simple-beam, 
Charpy-type A with a V-notch in accordance with Test Methods 
and Definitions A370 if the inch-pound units are specified or 
Test Methods Al058 if the M suffix (SI Units) standard is 
specified. Standard specimens 10 by 10 mm in cross section 
shall be used unless the material to be tested is of insufficient 
thickness, in which case the largest obtainable standard subsize 
impact specimens shall be used. When the size or shape of the 
finished fittings is insufficient to permit obtaining the smallest 
standard subsize impact specimens, an impact test by the fitting 
manufacturer will not be required. The material from which the 
specimens are taken shall be heat treated with a furnace charge 
in accordance with 10.4.2 or 10.4.3. Impact tests shall be made 
from either the raw material from which the fittings are made 
or from a finished fitting at the option of the manufacturer. 
10.3.2 Test specimens shall be obtained so that the longitu­
dinal axis of the specimen is parallel to the longitudinal axis of 
the fitting while the axis of the "V" shall be perpendicular to 
the surface. On wall thickness over 1 in. [25 mm] the 
specimens shall be obtained with their longitudinal axis located 
½ in. [13 mm] from the outer surface.
