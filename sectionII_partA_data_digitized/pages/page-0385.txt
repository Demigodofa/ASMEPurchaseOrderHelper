ASME BPVC.11.A-2025 SA-234/SA-234M (ASTM A234/A234M) 
the temperature range of 1350 °F [730 °C] to 1470 °F [800 °C] 
as a final heat treatment. 
8.3.8 Grade WP115 shall be normalized in the temperature 
range of 1920 °F [1050 °C] to 2010 °F [1100 °C]. 
8.4 WPB and WPC Fittings Made from Bar-Cold-finished 
bars reduced in cross-sectional area more than 10 % by cold 
drawing or cold rolling are not acceptable for use in the 
manufacture of these fittings unless the bars have been either 
stress relieved in the temperature range of 1100 to 1250 °F 
[595 to 675 °C], normalized, normalized and tempered, or 
annealed. Mechanical testing must be performed subsequent to 
the final heat-treating operation. 
8.5 Liquid quenching followed by tempering shall be per­
mitted for all grades when approved by the purchaser. Mini­
mum tempering temperature shall be 1100 °F [595 °C] for 
WPB, WPC, and WPR, 1150 °F [620 °C] for Grades WPl Type 
1 and Type 2, WPll Class 1, WPll Class 2, WP 12 Class 1, 
and WP12 Class 2 and 1250 °F [675 °C] for Grades WPS, 
WP9, WP22 Class 1, 1350 °F [730 °C] for both Grade WP91 
Type 1 and Type 2 and WP911 and 1380 °F [750 °C] for Grade 
WP115. The tempering temperature range for WP24 shall be as 
in 8.3.3. 
8.5.1 Liquid quenching followed by tempering for grades 
WPll Class 3 and WP22 Class 3 shall be permitted at the 
manufacturer's option unless otherwise provided in the pur­
chase order. The minimum tempering temperature for WPll 
Class 3 shall be 1150 °F [620 °C] and for WP22 Class 3 shall 
be 1250 °F [675 °C]. 
9. Chemical Composition 
9 .1 The chemical composition of each cast or heat used 
shall be determined and shall conform to the requirements of 
the chemical composition for the respective materials listed in 
Table 1. The ranges as shown have been expanded to include 
variations of the chemical analysis requirements that are listed 
in the various specifications for the starting materials (pipe, 
tube, plate, bar, and forgings) normally used in the manufac­
turing of fittings to this specification. 
9.2 The steel shall not contain any unspecified elements for 
the ordered grade to the extent that it conforms to the 
requirements of another grade for which that element is a 
specified element having a required minimum content. 
9.3 Weld metal used in the construction of carbon-steel 
fittings shall be mild steel analysis No. Al of Table QW-442, 
Section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, No. 
A2 may be used for Grade WPCW. 
9.4 The molybdenum and chromium content of the depos­
ited weld metal of alloy steel fittings shall be within the same 
percentage range as permitted for the base metal. 
9.5 Weld metal used in the construction of WP24 fittings 
shall be of the composition: 2.25 % Cr, 1 % Mo, 0.25 % V. 
10. Tensile Requirements 
10.1 The tensile properties of the fitting material shall 
conform to the requirements listed in Table 2. 
10.1.1 Longitudinal or transverse specimens cut from either 
a fitting or from the starting plate or pipe they were manufac-
tured from shall be acceptable for the tension test. For fittings 
made from forgings, the test specimen shall meet the require­
ments of Specification Al05/A105M for the tension test. 
10.1.2 While Table 2 specifies elongation requirements for 
both longitudinal and transverse specimens, it is not the intent 
that both requirements apply simultaneously. Instead, it is 
intended that only the elongation requirement that is appropri­
ate for the specimen used be applicable. 
10.2 One tension test shall be made on each heat of material 
and in the same condition of heat treatment as the finished 
fittings it represents. Where plate or pipe is used for the test 
specimen, the specimen thickness tested shall represent all 
fittings made from the same heat of material in the same heat 
treat condition in any thickness up to and including the tested 
thickness. Same heat treatment condition means that the same 
type of heat treatment (for example, stress relieve, normalize) 
and the same heat treating cycles (temperatures, time at 
temperature (minimum), temperature uniformity of ±25 °F 
[±14 °C], cooling method, etc.) are used (see 9.3 of Specifica­
tion A960/A960M for furnace uniformity requirement). 
10.3 When cold-formed fittings are furnished, samples of 
the raw material shall be normalized or stress relieved as 
required in 8.2.4. Tension tests conducted on these heat-treated 
samples shall be considered to be the tensile properties of the 
cold-formed fittings. 
10.4 Records of raw material test report of the tension tests 
shall be certification that the material of the fitting meets the 
tensile requirements of this specification provided the heat 
treatments of the finished fitting are the same as the raw 
material test report. If the raw material was not tested, or the 
fitting is not in the same condition of heat treatment, the fitting 
manufacturer shall perform the required test on material 
representative of the finished fitting from each heat of starting 
material. For fittings that are not heat treated in accordance 
with 8.2.1 or 8.2.3, the raw material test report data can be used 
to represent the fitting properties provided the heat treatments 
are the same. 
10.5 When testing of the finished fittings is requested by the 
purchaser, see Supplementary Requirement S51 in Specifica­
tion A960/ A960M.

11. Hardness 
11.1 Except when only one fitting is produced, and except 
for Grade WP91 Type 1 and Type 2, a minimum of two pieces 
per batch or continuous run shall be hardness tested to ensure 
the fittings are within the following limits for each grade in 
Table 2. The purchaser may verify that the requirement has 
been met by testing at any location on the fitting provided such 
testing does not render the fitting useless. 
11.1.1 Fittings of Grades WPS, WP9, and WPR-217 HBW 
maximum. 
11.1.2 Fittings of Grade WP24 and WP911-248 HBW 
maximum. 
11.1.3 Fittings of Grade WP92-269 HBW maximum. 
11.1.4 Fittings of all other grades-197 HBW maximum.
