Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 The steel may be made by any commercially accepted \nsteel making process. The steel may be either ingot cast or \nstrand cast. \n5.2 The finished wire shall be free from detrimental pipe \nand undue segregation. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements of Grade \n9254 for chemical composition specified in Table 2. \n6.2 Heat Analysis-Each heat of steel shall be analyzed to \ndetermine the percentage of elements prescribed in Table 2. \nThis analysis shall be made from a test specimen preferably \ntaken during the pouring of the heat. When requested, this shall \nbe reported to the purchaser and shall conform to the require\u00ad\nments of Table 2. \n6.3 Product Analysis-An analysis may be made by the \npurchaser from finished wire representing each heat of steel. \nThe chemical composition thus determined, as to elements \nrequired or restricted, shall conform to the product analysis \nrequirements in Table 4 of Specification A510/A510M. \n669 \n6.4 For referee purposes, Test Methods, Practices, and \nTerminology A751 shall be used. \n7. Mechanical Properties \n7.1 Annealed and Cold Drawn-When purchased in the \nannealed and cold-drawn condition, the wire shall have been \ngiven a sufficient amount of cold working to meet the purchas\u00ad\ner's coiling requirements and shall be in a suitable condition to \nrespond properly to heat treatment. In special cases the \nhardness or tensile strength, if desired, shall be stated in the \npurchase order. \n7.2 Quench and Tempered-When purchased in the quench \nand tempered condition, the tensile strength and minimum \npercent reduction of area shall conform to the requirements \nprescribed in Table 1. Tensile strength of shaped wires shall \nconfonn to this table based on the conversion to equivalent \nround dimensions. \n7 .2.1 Number of Tests-One test specimen shall be taken for \neach ten coils, or fraction thereof, in a lot. Each heat in a given \nlot shall be tested. \nTABLE 2 Chemical Requirements \nUNS Designation G92540 Grade No. 9254 \nRanges and Limits, % \nCarbon Manga- Phosphorus, Sulfur, Silicon Chro-\nnese max max mium \n0.51-0.59 0.60-0.80 0.035 0.040 1.20-1.60 0.60-0.80 ",
