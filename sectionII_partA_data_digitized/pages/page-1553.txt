ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 SA-1008/SA-1008M (ASTM A1008/A1008M} 
3.2.4 inclusion control, n-the process of reducing the 
volume fraction of inclusions or modifying the shape of 
inclusions to improve formability, weldability, and machinabil­
ity. 
3.2.4.1 Discussion-Inclusions, especially those elongated 
during the rolling process, create the conditions for initiating or 
propagating cracks, or both, when the material is stretched or 
bent during the manufacture of a part. The adverse effects of 
inclusions are minimized by reducing the content of inclusions 
in the steel or by altering the shape of inclusions, or both, 
through the use of additions during the steelmaking process 
that change the elongated shape of the inclusions to less 
harmful small, well dispersed globular inclusions. 
3.2.5 Required Hardness Steel (RHS), n-steel that adheres 
to a specified hardness range, at the time of shipment; may also 
be referenced as Specified Hardness Steel. 
3.2.5.1 Discussion-Chemical composition shall be deter­
mined by the producer unless there is prior agreement between 
producer and user, or seller and buyer. 
3.2.6 Solid-solution Hardened Steel or Solution Hardened 
Steel (SHS), n-steel strengthened through additions of 
elements, such as Mn, P, or Si, that can be dissolved within the 
crystalline structure of steels. 
3.2.6.1 Discussion-Alloying elements that form a solid­
solution with iron provide strengthening as a result of local 
distortions in atomic arrangements, which arise as a result of 
the mismatch between the atomic sizes of such elements and 
that of iron. 
3.2.7 Special Forming Steel (SFS), n-steel ordered to 1010 
chemistry or greater levels of carbon, manganese or both, 
which exhibits enhanced formability or mechanical properties. 
3.2.7.1 Discussion-Steel grades such as CS -1010 or CS -
1020 for example, adhere to chemistry requirements only, 
whereas SFS - 1010 or SFS - 1020, also provide enhanced 
formability. Due to greater carbon content, SFS - 1020 is not 
as formable as SFS - 1010. 
3.2.8 stabilization, n-addition of one or more nitride- or 
carbide-forming elements, or both, such as titanium and 
columbium, to control the level of the interstitial elements of 
carbon and nitrogen in the steel. 
3.2.8.1 Discussion-Stabilizing improves formability and 
increases resistance to aging. 
3.2.9 vacuum degassing, n-process of refining liquid steel 
in which the liquid is exposed to a vacuum as part of a special 
technique for removing impurities or for decarburizing the 
steel.
