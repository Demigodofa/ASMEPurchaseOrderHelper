Steel Castings, Martensitic Stainless and Alloy, for 
Pressure-Containing Parts, Suitable for High-Temperature 
Service 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A217/A217M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon ( e) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense . 
1. Scope* 
L 1 This specification 2 covers martensitic stainless steel and 
alloy steel castings for valves, flanges, fittings, and other 
pressure-containing parts (Note 1) intended primarily for 
high-temperature and corrosive service (Note 2). 
1.2 One grade of martensitic stainless steel and nine grades 
of ferritic alloy steel are covered. Selection will depend on 
design and service conditions, mechanical properties, and the 
high-temperature and corrosion-resistant characteristics (Note 
3). 
NoTB I-Carbon steel castings for pressure-containing parts are cov­
ered by Specification A216/A216M. Low alloy quench-and-tempered 
grades equivalent to Specification A217/A217M grades may be found in 
both Specifications A352/A352M and A487/A487M. 
NoTB 2-The grades covered by this specification represent materials 
that are generally suitable for assembly with other castings or wrought 
steel parts by fusion welding. It is not intended to imply that these grades 
possess equal degrees of weldability; therefore, it is the responsibility of 
the purchaser to establish for himself a suitable welding technique. Since 
these grades possess varying degrees of suitability for high-temperature 
and corrosion-resistant service, it is also the responsibility of the purchaser 
to determine which grade shall be furnished, due consideration being 
given to the requirements of the applicable construction codes. 
NoTB 3-The committee formulating this specification has included 
nine grades of materials that are considered to represent basic types of 
ferritic alloy steels suitable for valves, flanges, fittings, and other pressure­
containing parts. Additional alloy steels that may better fulfill certain types 
of service will he considered for inclusion in this specification by the 
committee as the need becomes apparent. 
1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each 
' This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee A0l on Steel, 
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee 
A0l.18 on Castings.

values from the two systems may result in nonconformance 
with the standard. 
1.4 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
