(Identical with ASTM Specification A513/A513M-20a except that Supplementary Requirements SS, S6, and either S7 or 
SB at the manufacturer's option and certification have been made mandatory, and for editorial corrections in 3.1.7 and 
SS.1.) 
ASME SA-513/SA-513M replaces paras. 3.1.7, 6.1, 7.1, and S5.1 of ASTM A513/A513M with the followirl!J: 
3.1.7 Report chemical analysis (see Section 6), product analysis (See Section 7), and results of tests performed to 
Supplementary Requirements SS, S6, and either S7 or SB. 
6.1 An analysis of each heat of steel shall be made by the steel manufacturer to determine the percentages of the ele-

except that where the heat identity has not been maintained or where the analysis is not sufficiently complete to permit 
conformance to be determined, the chemical composition determined from a product analysis made by the tubular 
manufacturer shall conform to the requirements specified for heat analysis. A report of such analysis shall be furnished to 
the purchaser. 
7.1 A product analysis shall be made by the supplier. The number and source of samples for such product analysis shall 
be based on the individual heat or lot identity of one of the following forms of material: 
SS.1 Round tubing shall conform to the tensile requirements and not necessarily the hardness limits shown in Table 
SS.1. For grades of round tubing not shown in Table SS.1, and for all square and rectangular tubing, tensile or hardness 
limits shall be upon agreement between the manufacturer and the purchaser.
