9.6.2 Hot-rolled pickled or descaled sheet is customarily 
furnished oiled. If the product is not to be oiled, it must be so 
specified since the cleaned surface is prone to rusting. 
9.6.3 Cold-rolled products covered by this specification can 
be furnished oiled or not oiled as specified. 
9.7 Sheet steel in coils or cut lengths may contain surface 
imperfections that can be removed with a reasonable amount of 
metal finishing by the purchaser. 
10. Workmanship 
10.1 Cut lengths shall have a workmanlike appearance and 
shall not have imperfections of a nature or degree for the 
product, the grade, class, and the quality ordered that will be 
detrimental to the fabrication of the finished part. 
10.2 Coils may contain some abnormal imperfections that 
render a portion of the coil unusable since the inspection of 
coils does not afford the producer the same opportunity to 
remove portions containing imperfections, as in the case with 
cut lengths. 
10.3 Surface Conditions: 
10.3.1 Exposed cold-rolled sheet is intended for applica­
tions where surface appearance is of primary importance, that 
is, exposed applications. Unexposed or annealed cold-rolled 
sheet is intended for applications where surface appearance is 
not of primary importance, that is, unexposed applications. 
10.3.2 Cut lengths for exposed applications shall not in­
clude individual sheets having major surface imperfections 
(holes, loose slivers, and pipe) and repetitive minor surface 
imperfections. Cut lengths may contain random minor surface 
imperfections that can be removed with a reasonable amount of 
metal finishing by the purchaser. These imperfections shall be 
acceptable to the purchaser within the manufacturer's pub­
lished standards. 
10.3.3 For coils for exposed applications, it is not possible 
to remove the surface imperfections listed in 10.3.2. Coils will 
contain such imperfections which shall be acceptable to the 
purchaser within the manufacturer's published standards. Coils 
contain more surface imperfections than cut lengths because 
the producer does not have the same opportunity to sort 
portions containing such imperfections, as is possible with cut 
lengths. 
10.3.4 Cut lengths for unexposed applications shall not 
include individual sheets having major surface imperfections 
such as holes, loose slivers, and pipe. In addition, unexposed 
cut lengths can be expected to contain more minor imperfec­
tions such as pits, scratches, sticker breaks, edge breaks, 
pinchers, cross breaks, roll marks, and other surface imperfec­
tions than exposed. These imperfections shall be acceptable to 
the purchaser without limitation. 
10.3.5 For coils for unexposed applications, it is not pos­
sible to remove the surface imperfections listed in 10.3.4. Coils

able. Minor imperfections shall be acceptable to the purchaser 
within the manufacturer's published standards. Unexposed 
coils contain more surface imperfections than exposed coils. 
11. Retests and Disposition of Non-Conforming Material 
11.1 Retests: 
11.1.1 Unless otherwise prohibited by the product 
specification, retests are permitted under the following circum­
stances: 
11.1.1.1 If any tension test specimen shows defective ma­
chining or develops flaws, it must be discarded and another 
specimen substituted. 
11.1.1.2 If the percent elongation of any tension test speci­
men is less than that specified and any part of the fracture is 
more than ¾ in. [20 mm] from the center of the gauge length 
of a 2-in. [50-mm] specimen, or is outside the middle half of
