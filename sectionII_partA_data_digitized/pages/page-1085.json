It is also obtained by measuring \nthe difference between the diagonals of the cut length. The out-of-square \ndeviation is one half of that difference. The tolerance for all thicknesses and all \nsizes is 1/16 in./6 in. of width or fraction thereof. \nTABLE 12 Restricted Squareness Tolerances of Hot-Rolled \n(Including Pickled) and Cold-Rolled Sheet (All Designations) \n(Cut Lengths) \nWhen cut lengths are specified restricted squareness, the width and the length \nare not less than the dimensions specified.

Oiling must be specified, when required. ",
