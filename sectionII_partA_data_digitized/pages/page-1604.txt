17.1.2.2 When hardness values converted from the Leeb 
number are reported, the portable instrument used shall be 
reported in parentheses, for example: 
(1) 350 HB (HLD) where the original hardness test was 
performed using the portable Leeb hardness test method with 
the HLD impact device and converted to the Brinell hardness 
value (HB). 
17 .1.3 Test Method Al 038-The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
appended with UCI in parenthesis to indicate that it was 
determined by a portable hardness tester, as in the following 
example: 
17.1.3.1 446 HV (UC/) 10 where 446 is the hardness test 
result using the portable UCI test method under a force of 10 
kgf. 
17.1.4 Test Method EJJ0: The measured hardness number 
shall be reported in accordance with the standard methods and 
appended with a IP to indicate that it was determined by a 
portable hardness tester, as follows: 
17.1.4.1 Rockwell Hardness Examples: 
( 1) 40 HRCIP where 40 is the hardness test result using the 
Rockwell C portable test method. 
(2) 72 HRBW/P where 72 is the hardness test result using 
the Rockwell B portable test method using a tungsten carbide 
ball indenter. 
17.1.4.2 Brinell Hardness Examples: 
(1) 220 HBWIP 10/3000 where 220 is the hardness test 
result using the Brinell portable test method with a ball of 
10 mm diameter and with a test force of 3000 kgf (29.42 kN) 
applied for 10 s to 15 s. 
(2) 350 HBWIP 51750 where 350 is the hardness test result 
using the Brinell portable test method with a ball of 5 mm 
diameter and with a test force of750 kgf (7.355 kN) applied for 
10 s to 15 s. 
CHARPY IMPACT TESTING 
18. Description 
18.1 The equipment, test specimen and testing procedures 
shall comply with the requirements of Test Methods E23, ISO 
148-1, or JIS Z 2242. 
19. Testing Machines 
19.1 Charpy machines used for testing steel generally have 
capacities in the 300 to 400 J energy range. Sometimes 
machines of lesser capacity are used; however, the capacity of 
the machine should be substantially in excess of the absorbed 
energy of the specimens (see Test Methods E23). The linear 
velocity at the point of impact should be in the range of 4.9 to 
5.8 mis or in accordance with ISO 148-1, or JIS Z 2242. 
20. Sampling and Number of Specimens 
20.1 Sampling: 
20.1.1 Test location and orientation should be addressed by 
the product specifications. If not, for wrought products, the test 
location shall be the same as that for the tensile specimen and 
the orientation shall be longitudinal with the notch perpendicu­
lar to the major surface of the product being tested. 
20.1.2 Number of Specimens: 
20.1.2.1 All specimens used for a Charpy impact test shall 
be taken from a single test coupon or test location. 
20.1.2.2 When the specification calls for a minimum aver­
age test result, three specimens shall be tested. 
20.1.2.3 When the specification requires determination of a 
transition temperature, eight to twelve specimens are usually 
needed. 
20.2 Type and Size: 
20.2.1 A standard full size Charpy V-notch specimen as 
shown in Test Methods E23, ISO 148-1, or JIS Z 2242 shall be 
used except as provided in the following sub-paragraphs. 
20.2.2 If a standard full-size specimen cannot be prepared, 
the largest feasible standard subsize specimen shall be pre­
pared. The specimens shall be machined so that the specimen 
does not include material nearer to the surface than 0.5 mm. 
20.2.3 Tolerances for standard subsize specimens are shown 
in Test Methods E23, ISO 148-1, or JIS Z 2242. 
20.3 Notch Preparation-The machining of the notch is 
critical, as it has been demonstrated that extremely minor 
variations in notch radius and profile, or tool marks at the 
bottom of the notch may result in erratic test data. 
21. Calibration 
21.1 Accuracy and Sensitivity-Calibrate and adjust Charpy 
impact machines in accordance with the requirements of the 
test methods used Test Methods E23, ISO 148-2, or JIS B 
7722. 
22. Conditioning-Temperature Control 
22.1 When a specific test temperature is required by the 
specification or purchaser, control the temperature of the 
heating or cooling medium within ±2 °F (1 °C). 
23. Procedure 
23.1 Individual Test Values: 
23.1.1 Impact Energy-Record the impact energy absorbed 
to the nearest J. 
23.1.2 Fracture Appearance: 
23.1.2.1 Determine the percentage of shear fracture area by 
any of the methods described in Test Methods E23, ISO 148-1, 
or JIS Z 2242. 
23.1.2.2 Determine the individual fracture appearance val­
ues to the nearest 5 % shear fracture and record the value. 
23.1.3 Lateral Expansion: 
23.1.3.1 Methods of measurement and precautions are de­
scribed in Test Methods E23. 
23.1.3.2 Measure the individual lateral expansion values to 
the nearest 0.025 mm and record the values. 
23.1.3.3 With the exception described as follows, any speci­
men that does not separate into two pieces when struck by a 
single blow may be reported as unbroken. If the specimen can 
be separated by force applied by bare hands, the specimen may 
be considered as having been separated by the blow. 
24. Interpretation of Test Result 
24.1 When the acceptance criterion of any impact test is 
specified to be a minimum average value at a given
