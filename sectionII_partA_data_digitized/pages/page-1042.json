[0.381 mm]. \n8. Finish \n8.1 Because retained scale may mask surface imperfections, \nas well as mar the plate surface, plates shall be descaled by the \nproducer after heat treatment. In the case of material to be \nheat-treated by the purchaser, the plates shall be descaled by \nthe producer prior to shipment. \n9. Marking \n9.1 In addition to the marking required in Specification \nA20/ A20M, each plate shall be legibly stamped or stenciled, \ndepending upon the ordered thickness, with the letters QT, \nexcept as otherwise specified in 9 .1.1. \n9.1.1 When the optional heat treatment in 5.2.2.1 is \nperformed, the plates shall be marked with the letters QTT \ninstead of QT. \n10. Keywords \n10.1 alloy steel; alloy steel plate; pressure containing parts; \npressure vessel steels; steel plates; steel plates for pressure \nvessel applications \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nSupplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the order. \nA list of standard supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser are included \nin Specification A20/A20M. Several of those considered suitable for use with this specification are \nlisted below. by title. Other tests may be performed by agreement between the supplier and the \npurchaser. \nS 1. Vacuum Treatment, \nS2. Product Analysis, \nS3. Simulated Post-Weld Heat Treatment of Mechanical \nTest Coupons, \nS6. Drop Weight Test (for Material 0.625 in. [16 mm] and \nover in Thickness), \nS8. Ultrasonic Examination in accordance with Specifica\u00ad\ntion A435/A435M, \nS9. Magnetic Particle Examination, \nS 11. Ultrasonic Examination in accordance with Specifica\u00ad\ntion A577/A577M, \nSl2. Ultrasonic Examination in accordance with Specifica\u00ad\ntion A578/A578M, and \nS 17. Vacuum Carbon-Deoxidized Steel. \nADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nAlso listed below are additional optional Supplementary Requirements S55 and S56, which are \nsuitable for this specification. \nS55. Longitudinal Charpy Impact Energy Absorption Re\u00ad\nquirement \nS55.1 The longitudinal Charpy V-notch impact properties \nshall not be less than 25 ft\u2022lbf [34 J] at the specified tempera\u00ad\nture. \nS55.2 Each impact test value shall constitute the average \nvalue of three specimens, with not more than one value below \nthe specified minimum value of 25 ft\u00b7lbf [34 J] but in no case \nbelow 20 ft\u00b7lbf [27 J] for full size specimens. \n942 \nS56. Transverse Charpy Impact Energy Absorption Re\u00ad\nquirement \nS56.1 The transverse Charpy V-notch impact properties \nshall not be less than 20 ft\u00b7lbf [27 J] at the specified tempera\u00ad\nture. \nS56.2 Each impact test value shall constitute the average \nvalue of three specimens, with not more than one value below \nthe specified minimum value of 20 ft\u2022lbf [27 J] but in no case \nbelow 15 ft\u2022lbf [20 J] for full size specimens.
