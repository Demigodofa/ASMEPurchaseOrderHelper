[100 mm] in length shall be flattened cold between parallel \nplates in two steps. The weld shall be placed 90\u00b0 from the \ndirection of the applied force (at the point of maximum \nbending). During the first step, which is a test for ductility, no \ncracks or breaks on the inside or outside surfaces, except as \nprovided for in 21.3.4, shall occur until the distance between \nthe plates is less than the value of H calculated by Eq 2. During \nthe second step, which is a test for soundness, the flattening \nshall be continued until the specimen breaks or the opposite \nwalls of the pipe meet. \n21.3 Seamless, Centrifugally Cast, and Welded Pipe: \n21.3.1 Evidence of laminated or defective material or weld \nthat is revealed during the entire flattening test shall be cause \nfor rejection. \n21.3.2 Surface imperfections not evident in the test speci\u00ad\nmen before flattening, but revealed during the first step of the \nflattening test, shall be judged in accordance with the finish \nrequirements. \n21.3.3 Superficial ruptures resulting from surface imperfec\u00ad\ntions shall not be a cause for rejection. \n21.3.4 When low D-to-t ratio tubular products are tested, \nbecause the strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably \nhigh on the inside surface at the six and twelve o'clock \nlocations, cracks at these locations shall not be cause for \nrejection if the D to t ratio is less than 10. \n22. Hydrostatic Test Requirements \n22.1 Except as provided in 22.2 and 22.3, each length of \npipe shall be tested by the manufacturer to a hydrostatic \npressure which will produce in the pipe wall a stress not less \nthan 60 % of the minimum specified yield strength for carbon \nand ferritic alloy steel pipe, or 50 % of the specified minimum \nyield strength for austenitic alloy steel pipe. The test pressure \nor stress shall be determined by the following equation: \nP = 2St/D or S = PD/2t (3) \n22.2 Regardless of pipe-wall stress-level determined by Eq \n3, the minimum hydrostatic test pressure required to satisfy \nthese requirements need not exceed 2500 psi [17.0 MPa] for \noutside diameters (see Din 22.1) of 3.5 in. [88.9 mm] or less, \nnor 2800 psi [19.0 MPa] for outside diameters over 3.5 in. \n[88.9 mm]. This does not prohibit testing at higher pressures at \nthe manufacturer's option or as provided in 22.3. \n22.3 With concurrence of the manufacturer, a minimum \nhydrostatic test pressure in excess of the requirements of 22.2 \nor 22.1, or both, may be stated on the order. \n22.4 The test pressure shall be held for a minimum of 5 s, \nwithout resultant leakage through the pipe wall. For welded \npipe, the test pressure shall be held for a time sufficient to \npermit the inspector to examine the entire length of the welded \nseam. \n22.5 The hydrostatic test may not be capable of inspecting \nthe end portion of the pipe. The length of pipe that cannot be \ntested shall be determined by the manufacturer and, when \nspecified in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser. \n23. Material Test Report \n23.1 The producer or supplier shall furnish a material test \nreport certifying that the material was manufactured, sampled, \ntested and inspected in accordance with the specification, \nincluding year date, the supplementary requirements, and any \nother requirements designated in the purchase order or \ncontract, and that the results met the requirements of that \nspecification, the supplementary requirements and the other \nrequirements. A signature or notarization is not required on the \nmaterial test report, but the document shall be dated and shall \nclearly identify the organization submitting the report. Not\u00ad\nwithstanding the absence of a signature or notarization, the \norganization submitting the report is responsible for the con\u00ad\ntents of the report. \n23.2 In addition, the material test report shall include the \nfollowing information and test results, when applicable: \n23.2.1 Heat Number, \n23.2.2 Heat Analysis, \n23.2.3 Product Analysis, if specified or required, where: -------=-=--------------------------';ttL. ~sile-Properties, \nP = hydrostatic test pressure in psi or MPa, 23.2.5 Width of the gage length, when longitudinal strip \nS = pipe wall stress in psi or MPa, tension test specimens are used, \nt = specified nominal wall thickness, nominal wall thick- 23 _2 _6 Bend Test acceptable, \nness corresponding to specified ANSI schedule number, 23 _2 _ 7 Flattening Test acceptable, \nor 1.143 times the specified minimal wall thickness, in. 23.2.8 Hydrostatic Test pressure \n[mm], and 23.2.9 Non-destructive Electric Test method, D = specified outside diameter, outside diameter correspond-\ning to specified ANSI pipe size, or outside diameter 23 -2 .lO Impact TeS t results, and \ncalculated by adding 2t (as defined above) to the 23.2.11 Other test results or information required to be \nspecified inside diameter, in.
