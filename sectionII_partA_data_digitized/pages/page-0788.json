Scope \n1.1 This specification covers a group of requirements \nwhich, with the exceptions of 6.3 and Sections 7, 8, 19, 20, 21, \n22, 23, 24, and 25, are mandatory requirements to the follow\u00ad\ning ASTM tubular product specifications: \nTitle of Specification ASTM DesignationA \nElectric-Resistance-Welded Carbon Steel and Carbon- A 178/ A 178M \nManganese Steel Boiler Tubes \nSeamless Cold-Drawn Low-Carbon Steel Heat- A179/A179M \nExchanger and Condenser Tubes \nSeamless Carbon Steel Boiler Tubes for High-Pressure A 192/A 192M \nService \nSeamless Medium-Carbon Steel Boiler and Super- A210/A210M \nheater Tubes \nElectric-Resistance-Welded Carbon Steel Heat- A214/A214M \nExchanger and Condenser Tubes \nSeamless and Electric-Welded Low-Alloy Steel Tubes A423/A423M \nSpecification for Seamless and Welded Carbon Steel A498/A498M \nHeat-Exchanger Tubes with Integral Fins \nSeamless Cold-Drawn Carbon Steel Feedwater Heater A556/A556M \nTubes \nSeamless, Cold-Drawn Carbon Steel Tubing for Hy\u00ad\ndraulic System Service \nA822/A822M \nA These designations refer to the latest issue of the respective specifications. \n1.2 One or more of Sections 6.3, 7, 8, 19, 20, 21, 22, 22.1, \n24, and 25 apply when the product specification or purchase \norder has a requirement for the test or analysis described by \nthese sections. \n1.3 In case of conflict between a requirement of the product \nspecification and a requirement of this general requirement \nspecification only the requirement of the product specification \nneed be satisfied. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \n738 \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation (SI) of the product specification is specified in the \norder. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
