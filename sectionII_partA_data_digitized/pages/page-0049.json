  "text": "SPECIFICATION REMOVAL \nFrom time to time, it becomes necessary to remove specifications from this Part of Section II. This occurs because the \nsponsoring society (e.g., ASTM, AWS, CEN) has notified ASME that the specification has either been replaced with an\u00ad\nother specification, or that there is no known use and production of a material. Removal of a specification from this Sec\u00ad\ntion also results in concurrent removal of the same specification from Section IX and from all of the ASME Boiler and \nPressure Vessel Construction Codes that reference the material. This action effectively prohibits further use of the ma\u00ad\nterial in ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel construction. \nThe following specifications will be dropped from this Section in the next Edition, unless information concerning cur\u00ad\nrent production and use of the material is received before December 1 of this year: \nSF-568M \nIf you are currently using and purchasing new material to this specification for ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code \nconstruction, and if discontinuance of this specification would present a hardship, please notify the Secretary of the \nASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee, at the address shown below: \nSecretary \nASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee \nTwo Park Avenue \nNew York, NY 10016-5990 \nxlix \n(25) ",
