INTERNATIONAL 
Standard Specification for 
Seamless, Welded, and Heavily Cold Worked Austenitic 
Stainless Steel Pipes 1 
This standard is issued under the fixed designation A312/ A312M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year 
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. 
A superscript epsilon (s) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. 
1. Scope* 
1.1 This specification 2 covers seamless, straight-seam 
welded, and heavily cold worked welded austenitic stainless 
steel pipe intended for high-temperature and general corrosive 
service. 
1.2 Grades TP304H, TP309H, TP309HCb, TP310H, 
TP310HCb, TP316H, TP321H, TP347H, and TP348H are 
modifications of Grades TP304, TP309Cb, TP309S, TP310Cb, 
TP310S, TP316, TP321, TP347, and TP348, and are intended 
for service at temperatures where creep and stress rupture 
properties are important. 
1.3 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for 
pipe where a greater degree of testing is desired. These 
supplementary requirements call for additional tests to be made 
and, when desired, it is permitted to specify in the order one or 
more of these supplementary requirements. 
1.4 Table Xl.l lists the standardized dimensions of welded 
and seamless stainless steel pipe as shown in ASME B36.19. 
These dimensions are also applicable to heavily cold worked 
pipe. Pipe having other dimensions is permitted to be ordered 
and furnished provided such pipe complies with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.5 Grades TP321 and TP321H have lower strength require­
ments for pipe manufactured by the seamless process in 
nominal wall thicknesses greater than 3/s in. [9.5 mm]. 
1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-confonnance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, 
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee 
A0!.10 on Stainless and Alloy Steel Tubular Products.

Norn 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has 
been substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as "nominal 
diameter," "size," and "nominal size." 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
