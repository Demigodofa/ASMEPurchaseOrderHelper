The sub\u00ad\nmerged arc process with neutral flux, the gas metal-arc welding \nand gas tungsten-arc welding processes are permitted. \n13.1.3 Defects shall be completely removed prior to weld\u00ad\ning by chipping or grinding to sound metal as verified by \nmagnetic particle inspection in accordance with Test Method \nA275/A275M for the alloy steels in this specification, or by \nliquid penetrant inspection in accordance with Test Method \nE165/El65M for all grades. \n13.1.4 After repair welding, the welded area shall be ground \nsmooth to the original contour and shall be free of defects as \nverified by magnetic-particle or liquid-penetrant inspection, as \napplicable. \n13.l.5 The preheat, interpass temperature, and post-weld \nheat treatment, requirements given in Table 6 shall be met. \n13.1.6 Repair by welding shall not exceed 10 % of the \nsurface area of the part. Repair by welding shall not exceed \n33Y3 % of the wall thickness of the finished part or 3/s in. [9.5 \nmm], whichever is less. \n14. Inspection \n14.1 The manufacturer shall afford the purchaser's inspector \nall reasonable facilities necessary to satisfy the inspector that \nthe material is being furnished in accordance with the purchase \norder. Inspection by the purchaser shall not interfere unneces\u00ad\nsarily with the manufacturer's operations. All tests and inspec\u00ad\ntions shall be made at the place of manufacture unless \notherwise agreed upon. \n15. Rejection \n15.l Each part that develops defects during shop working \noperations or in service shall be rejected and the manufacturer \nnotified. \n15.2 Samples representing material rejected by the pur\u00ad\nchaser shall be preserved until disposition of the claim has been \nagreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser. \n16. Certification \n16.1 In addition to the certification requirements of Speci\u00ad\nfication A961/A961M, test reports shall be furnished to the \npurchaser or his representative. Test reports shall provide the \nfollowing as applicable: \n16.1.1 Type of heat treatment, Section 7, (Table 2), \n16.1.2 Chemical analysis results, Section 6 (Table 1), re\u00ad\nported results shall be to the same number of significant figures \nas the limits specified in Table 1 for that element, \n16.1.3 Product analysis results, Section 10 (Table 4 or Table \n5), \n16.1.4 Tensile property results, Section 9 (Table 3), report \nthe yield strength and tensile strength, in ksi [MPa], elongation \nand reduction in area, in percent, \n16.1.5 Hardness results, 9.6 (Table 3), \n16.1.6 Structural integrity test results, Section 8, and \n16.1.7 Any supplementary testing required by the purchase \norder. \n17. Product Marking \n17 .1 In addition to marking requirements of Specification \nA961/A961M, the following additional marking requirements \nshall apply: \n17 .1.1 Quenched and tempered alloy steel parts shall be \nmarked with the letters \"QT\" following the specification \ndesignation. \n17.1.2 Hot isostatically-pressed parts repaired by welding \nshall be marked with the letter \"W\" following the specification \ndesignation. \n17 .1.3 Hot isostatically-pressed parts meeting all require\u00ad\nments for more than one class or grade are permitted at the \noption of the producer to be marked with more than one class \nor grade designation. \n17.2 Bar Coding-In addition to the requirements in 17.1, \nbar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification \nmethod. The purchaser may specify in the order that a specific \nbar coding system be used. The bar coding system, if applied \nat the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one \nof the published industry standards for bar coding. If used on \nsmall parts, the bar code may be applied to the box or a \nsubstantially applied tag. \n18.
