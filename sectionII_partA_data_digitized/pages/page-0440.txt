SA-265 ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
(2) The specified minimum tensile strength of the base 
steel is less than or equal to 70 000 psi (485 MPa). 
( 3) The specified minimum yield strength of the base steel 
is less than or equal to 40 000 psi (275 MPa). 
( 4) The tensile properties thus determined shall not be less 
than the minimum and not more than 5000 psi (35 MPa) over 
the maximum prescribed in the specification for the base steel 
used. All other tensile test requirements of the specification for 
the base steel shall be met. 
7.1.2 The tensile properties shall be determined by a 
tension test of the base steel only for clad plates that meet one 
of the following conditions. The properties thus determined 
shall meet all of the tensile test requirements for the base steel. 
(1) The composite gage is greater than 1 ½ in. (38 mm). 
(2) The specified minimum tensile strength of the base 
steel is greater than 70 000 psi (485 MPa). 
( 3) The specified minimum yield strength of the base steel 
is greater than 40 000 psi (275 MPa). 
7 .1.3 If the cladding is for corrosion allowance only, the 
cladding need not be included in the tensile test. The tensile 
properties thus determined shall meet the base steel require­
ments. 
7.2 Test for strength of the bond, when required, must be 
specified by the purchaser and shall consist of one of the 
following. 
7.2.1 Shear Strength-When required by the purchaser, the 
minimum shear strength of the alloy cladding and base metals 
shall be 20 000 psi (140 MPa). The shear test, when specified, 
shall be made in the manner indicated in 1. The minimum 
cladding thickness for shear testing shall be 0.075 in. (1.9 mm) 
exclusive as ordered. Testing for shear strength for clad plates 
with minimum cladding thickness of 0.075 in (1.9 mm) or less 
shall be permitted upon agreement between the purchaser and 
the manufacturer.

7 .2.2 Bond Strength-As an alternative to the shear strength 
test provided in 7.2. l or when agreed upon by the purchaser 
and the manufacturer, or both, three bend tests shall be made 
with the alloy cladding in compression to determine the quality 
of the bond. These bend tests shall be made in the manner of 
the tension tests indicated in Fig. 2 and shall be bent through an 
angle of 180° to the bend diameters provided for in either 
Specification A6/ A6M or Specification A20/ A20M (Appendix 
X4, or equivalent), as applicable. At least two of the three tests 
shall show not more than 50 % separation on both edges of the 
bent portion. Greater separation shall be cause for rejection. 
7.3 Methods and practices relating to mechanical testing 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with the 
Test Methods and Definitions of A370. 
8. Number of Tests and Retests 
8.1 One or more tension tests, as required by the specifica­
tions for the base metal and when specified, one shear test or 
three bond bend tests shall be made, representing each plate as 
rolled. Each specimen shall be in the final condition of heat 
treatment required for the plate, including any SPWHT if 
required. 
8.2 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws, it may be discarded and another specimen 
substituted. 
9. Test Specimens 
9 .1 The tension test specimens shall conform to the require­
ments prescribed in the specifications for the base metal. 
9.2 Bend test specimens for the alternative bond strength 
tests shall be taken at right angles to its longitudinal axis.

Norn 1-When necessary, it is permissible to use a narrower specimen, 
but in such a case the reduced portion shall be not less than 1 in. in width. 
Norn 2-Punch marks for measuring elongation after fracture shall be 
made on the flat or on the edge of the specimen and within the parallel 
section; either a set of nine punch marks 1 in. apart, or one or more sets 
of 8-in. punch marks may be used. 
Norn 3-The dimension t is the thickness of the test specimen as
