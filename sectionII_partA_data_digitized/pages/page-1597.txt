3. General Precautions 
3.1 The ASTM track is the default track; if other than the 
ASTM track is used that track shall be reported. 
3.2 Certain methods of fabrication, such as bending, 
forming, and welding, or operations involving heating, may 
affect the properties of the material under test. Therefore, the 
product specifications cover the stage of manufacture at which 
mechanical testing is to be performed. The properties shown by 
testing prior to fabrication may not necessarily be representa­
tive of the product after it has been completely fabricated. 
3.3 Improper machining or preparation of test specimens 
may give erroneous results. Care should be exercised to assure 
good workmanship in machining. Improperly machined speci­
mens should be discarded and other specimens substituted. 
3.4 Flaws in the specimen may also affect results. If any test 
specimen develops flaws, the retest provision of the applicable 
product specification shall govern. 
3 .5 If any test specimen fails because of mechanical reasons 
such as failure of testing equipment or improper specimen 
preparation, it may be discarded and another specimen taken. 
4. Orientation of Test Specimens 
4.1 The terms "longitudinal test" and "transverse test" are 
used only in material specifications for wrought products and 
are not applicable to castings. When such reference is made to 
a test coupon or test specimen, the following definitions apply: 
4.1.1 Longitudinal Test, unless specifically defined 
otherwise, signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is 
parallel to the direction of the greatest extension of the steel 
during rolling or forging. The stress applied to a longitudinal 
tension test specimen is in the direction of the greatest 
extension, and the axis of the fold of a longitudinal bend test 
specimen is at right angles to the direction of greatest exten­
sion. 
4.1.2 Transverse Test, unless specifically defined otherwise, 
signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is at right 
angles to the direction of the greatest extension of the steel 
during rolling or forging. The stress applied to a transverse 
tension test specimen is at right angles to the greatest 
extension, and the axis of the fold of a transverse bend test 
specimen is parallel to the greatest extension. 
4.2 The terms "radial test" and "tangential test" are used in 
material specifications for some wrought circular products and 
are not applicable to castings .. When such reference is made to 
a test coupon or test specimen, the following definitions apply: 
4.2.1 Radial Test, unless specifically defined otherwise, 
signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is perpen­
dicular to the axis of the product and coincident with one of the 
radii of a circle drawn with a point on the axis of the product 
as a center. 
4.2.2 Tangential Test, unless specifically defined otherwise, 
signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is perpen­
dicular to a plane containing the axis of the product and tangent 
to a circle drawn with a point on the axis of the product as a 
center.
