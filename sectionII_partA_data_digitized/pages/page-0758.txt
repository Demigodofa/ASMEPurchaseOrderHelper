SA-423 /SA-423M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Seamless and Electric-Welded Low-Alloy Steel Tubes 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers minimum-wall-thickness, 
low-alloy steel tubes for pressure containing parts such as 
economizers or other applications where corrosion resistance is 
important. 
1.2 The tubing sizes and thicknesses usually furnished to 
this specification are ½ to 5 in. [12.7 to 127 mm] in outside 
diameter and 0.035 to 0.500 in. [0.9 to 12.7 mm] inclusive, in 
minimum wall thickness. Tubing having other dimensions may 
be furnished, provided such tubes comply with all other 
requirements of this specification. 
1.3 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to 
tubing smaller than ¼ in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or 0.015 
in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. 
1.4 This specification covers three grades, two types, and 
two manufacture finishes: 
1.4.1 Grades 1, 2, and 3 are identified in Table 1 (Chemical 
Requirements), and Table 3 (Tensile Requirements), 
1.4.2 Type (seamless or electric-resistance welded), 
1.4.3 Manufacture (hot finished or cold finished). 
1.5 Optional supplementary requirements S 1 and S2 are 
provided and, when desired, shall be so stated in the order. 
1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the 
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each 
system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system 
shall be used independently of the other. Combining values 
from the two systems may result in non-conformance with the 
standard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the "M" 
designation of this specification is specified in the order. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
708 
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.

3. Ordering Information 
3. l Orders for material under this specification shall include 
the following, as required, to describe the desired material 
adequately: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Type of material (seamless or electric-resistance-
welded tubes), 
3.1.3 Grade 1, 2, or 3 (Table 1 and Table 3), 
3.1.4 Manufacture (hot finished or cold finished), 
3.1.5 Size (outside diameter and minimum wall thickness), 
3.1.6 Length (specific or random), 
3.1.7 Required test options (hydrostatic or electric test, 
11.7), 
3 .1. 8 Test report required ( see Certification Section of 
Specification A450/ A450M), 
3.1.9 Specification designation (including year of issue), 
and 
3.1.10 Special requirements and any supplementary require­
ments selected. 
4. Manufacture 
4.1 Tubes made by the seamless process may be hot finished 
or cold finished. 
S. Heat Treatment 
5.1 All tubes shall be normalized or given such heat 
treatment as may be necessary to conform to the requirements 
of this specification.
