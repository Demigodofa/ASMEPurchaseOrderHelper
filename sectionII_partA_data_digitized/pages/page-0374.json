Scope \n1.1 This specification covers the highest quality of \nround chromium-vanadium alloy steel valve spring wire, \nuniform in quality and temper, intended for the manufac\u00ad\nture of valve springs and other springs requiring high\u00ad\nfatigue properties when used at moderately elevated tem\u00ad\nperatures. This wire shall be either in the annealed and \ncold-drawn or oil-tempered condition as specified by the \npurchaser. \n1.2 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound \nunits are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the \ntext, the inch-pound units are shown in brackets. The values \nstated in each system are not exact equivalents; therefore, \neach system must be used independent of the other. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA 370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Test\u00ad\ning of Steel Products \nA 700 Practices for Packaging, Marking, and Loading \nMethods for Steel Products for Domestic Shipment \nA 751 Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology for \nChemical Analysis of Steel Products \nE 29 Practice for Using Significant Digits in Test Data to \nDetermine Conformance with Specifications \n2.2 ANSI Standard: \nB32.4 Preferred Metric Sizes for Round, Square, Rectan\u00ad\ngle, and Hexagon Metal Products \n2.3 Federal Standard: \nFed. Std. No. 123 Marking for Shipment (Civil Agencies) \n2.4 Military Standard: \nMIL-STD-163 Steel Mill Products, Preparation for Ship\u00ad\nment and Storage \n322 \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for material under this specification should \ninclude the following information for each ordered item: \n3.1.1 Quantity (mass), \n3.1.2 Name of material (chromium-vanadium alloy \nsteel valve spring quality wire), \n3.1.3 Dimensions (Table 1 and Section 8), \n3.1.4 Condition (Section 6), \n3.1.5 Packaging (Section 14), \n3.1.6 Heat analysis report, if requested (Section 5.2), \n3.1. 7 Certification or test report, or both, if specified \n(Section 13), and \n3.1.8 ASTM designation and year of issue. \nNOTE 1 - A typical ordering description is as follows: 20 000 kg oil\u00ad\ntempered chromium-vanadium alloy steel valve spring quality wire, size \n6.00 mm in 150 kg coils to ASTM A 232/A 232M dated \n------~ or for inch-pound units, 40 000 lb oil-tempered \nchromium-vanadium alloy steel valve spring quality wire, size \n0.250 in. in 350-lb coils to ASTM A 232/A 232M \ndated ________ _ \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 The steel may be made by any commercially, \naccepted steel making process. The steel may be either \ningot cast or strand cast. \n4.2 The finished wire shall be free from detrimental \npipe and undue segregation. \n5. Chemical Requirements \n5.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements for \nchemical composition specified in Table 2. \n5.2 Heat Analysis - Each heat of steel shall be analyzed \nby the manufacturer to determine the percentage of ele\u00ad\nments prescribed in Table 2. This analysis shall be made ",
