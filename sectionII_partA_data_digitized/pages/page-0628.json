A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscdpt epsilon (e) indicates an editodal change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope* \n1.1 This specification 2 covers heavy-wall carbon and alloy \nsteel pipe (Note 1) made from turned and bored forgings and is \nintended for high-temperature service. Pipe ordered under this \nspecification shall be suitable for bending and other forming \noperations and for fusion welding. Selection will depend on \ndesign, service conditions, mechanical properties and high\u00ad\ntemperature characteristics. \nNoTE 1-The use of the word \"pipe\" throughout the several sections of \nthis specification is used in the broad sense and intended to mean pipe \nheaders, or leads. \nNoTE 2-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has \nbeen substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as \"nominal \ndiameter,\" \"size,\" and '\"nominal size.\" \n1.2 Several grades of ferritic steels are covered. Their \ncompositions are given in Table 1. \n1.3 Supplementary requirements (S 1 to S7) of an optional \nnature are provided. Supplementary requirements S 1 to S5 call \nfor additional tests to be made, and when desired shall be so \nstated in the order, together with the number of such tests \nrequired as applicable. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom-\n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nA0l.10 on Stainless and Alloy Steel Tubular Products. \nCurrent edition approved May 1, 2023.
