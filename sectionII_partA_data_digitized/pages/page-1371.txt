treated shall be tested in the heat treated condition in accor­
dance with the appropriate practice in Practices A 763 for the 
specified grade, or as agreed upon for TP409. 
11.2 One full-section sample l in. [25 mm] long from each 
lot of straight tubes shall be tested in the finished condition in 
accordance with the appropriate practice in Practices A 763 for 
the specified grade, or as agreed upon for TP409. 
11.3 The appearance of any fissures or cracks in the test 
specimen, when evaluated in accordance with the Evaluation 
Sections of Practices A 763 indicating the presence of inter­
granular attack, shall be cause for rejection of that lot. 
11.4 For corrosion test requirements, the term "lot" applies 
to all tubes, p1ior to cutting to length, of the same nominal 
diameter and wall thickness, produced from the same heat of 
steel and annealed in a continuous furnace at the same 
temperature, time at temperature, and furnace speed. 
12. Permissible Variations in Dimensions (Fig. I) 
12.1 Permissible variations from the specified outside diam­
eter shall be in accordance with Specification A1016/A1016M. 
Those tolerances do not apply to the bent portion of the 
U-tubes. At the bent portion of a U-tube for R = 2 x D or 
greater, neither the major nor minor diameter of the tube shall 
deviate from the nominal diameter prior to bending by more 
than 10 %. If less than 2 x D is specified, tolerances could be 
greater.

12.2 Permissible Variations from the Specified Wall Thick­
ness: 
12.2.1 Permissible variations from the specified minimum 
wall thickness shall not exceed +20 - 0 %. 
12.2.2 Permissible variations from the specified average 
wall thickness are ± 10 % of the nominal wall thickness. 
12.2.3 The wall thickness of the tube in the U-bent section 
shall not be less than value determined by the equation: 
4RT 
t1= 4R+D 
where: 
fr = wall thickness after bending, in. [mm], 
T = specified minimum tube wall thickness, in. [mm], 
R = centerline bend radius, in. [mm], and 
D = nominal outside tube diameter, in. [mm]. 
12.3 Permissible Variations from the Specified Length: 
12.3.1 Straight Lengths-The maximum permissible varia­
tions for lengths 24 ft [7.3 m] and shorter shall be + 1/s in. [+3 
mm], -0; for lengths longer than 24 ft [7.3 m], an additional 
over tolerance of +\Is in. [+3 mm] for each 10 ft [3 m], or 
fraction thereof, shall be permitted up to a maximum of +\/2 in. 
[+13 mm]. 
12.3.2 U-Bends-In the case of U-tubes, the length of the 
tube legs, as measured from the point of tangency of the bend 
and the tube leg to the end of the tube leg, shall not be less than 
specified, but may exceed the specified values by the amount 
given in Table 5. The difference in lengths of the tube legs shall 
not be greater than 1/s in. [3 mm] unless otherwise specified. 
12.4 The end of any tube may depart from square by not 
more than the amount given in Table 6. 
12.5 The leg spacing measured between the points of 
tangency of the bend to the legs shall not vary from the value 
(2R-specified tube outside diameter) by more than 1/16 in. [1.5 
mm] where R is the center-line bend radius. 
12.6 The bent portion of the U-tube shall be substantially 
uniform in curvature, and not to exceed ± 1/1.6 in. [ ±: 1.5 mm] of 
the nominal center-line radius. 
12.7 Permissible deviation from the plane of bend (see Fig. 
1) shall not exceed \/16 in. [1.5 mm] as measured from the 
points of tangency. 
13. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance 
13 .1 Tubing purchased to this specification is intended for 
use in heat exchangers and will be inse1ted through close­
fitting holes in baffles or support plates, or both, spaced along 
the tube length. The tube ends will also be inserted into very 
close-fitting holes in a tubesheet and expanded and may be 
welded therein. The tubes shall be able to stand roll expanding 
(See Note 1) and bending without showing cracks and flaws, 
and shall be finished reasonably straight and suitable for the
