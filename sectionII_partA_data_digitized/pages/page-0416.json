Stress-Relieved Annealed Tubes \nS 1.1 For use in certain corrosives, particularly chlorides \nwhere stres~ corrosion may occur, tubes in Grades TP304L, \nTP316L, TP321, TP347, and TP348 may be specified in the \nstress-relieved annealed condition. Details of these supplemen\u00ad\ntal requirements shall be agreed upon by the manufacturer and \nthe purchaser. \nS 1.2 When stress-relieved tubes are specified, tubes shall be \ngiven a heat treatment at 1550 to 1650 \u00b0F [845 to 900 \u00b0C] after \nroll straightening. Cooling from this temperature range may be \neither in air or by slow cooling. No mechanical straightening is \npermitted after the stress-relief treatment. \nS 1.3 Straightness of the tubes shall be a matter of negotiation \nbetween the purchaser and manufacturer. \nS2. Minimum Wall Tubes \nS2.1 When specified by the purchaser, tubes shall be fur\u00ad\nnished on a minimum wall basis. Such tubes shall satisfy the \nminimum wall thickness requirements of Specification A1016/ \nAl016M rather than the nominal wall requirements of this \nspecification. In ~ddition to the marking required by Section \n18, the tubing shall be marked S2. \nS3. Pneumatic Test \nS3.1 The tubing shall be examined by a pneumatic test \n(either air under water or pneumatic leak test) in accordance \nwith Specification A1016/Al016M. \nS4. Stabilizing Heat Treatment \nS4.1 Subsequent to the solution anneal required in Section \n6, Grades TP309HCb, TP310HCb, TP321, TP321H, TP347, \nTP347H, TP348, and TP348H shall be given a stabilization \nheat treatment at a temperature lower than that used for the \ninitial solution annealing heat treatment. The temperature of \nstabilization heat treatment shall be at a temperature as agreed \nupon between the purchaser and vendor. \nSS. DELETED \nS6. Intergranular Corrosion Test \nS6.l When specified, material shall pass intergranular cor\u00ad\nrosion tests conducted by the manufacturer in accordance with \nPractices A262, Practice E. \nNoTE S6.1-Practice E requires testing on the sensitized condition for \nlow carbon or stabilized grades, and on the as-shipped condition for other \ngrades. \nS6.2 A stabilization heat treatment in accordance with \nSupplementary Requirement S4 may be necessary and is \npermitted in order to meet this requirement for the grades \ncontaining titanium or columbium, particularly in their H \nversions. \n364 \n87. Weld Decay Test \nS7.1 This test is not applicable to alloys with a nickel \ncontent 2:: 19.0 % or a molybdenum content 2:: 4.00 %, or both. \nNorn S7.1-Toe weld decay test is sensitive for the presence of delta \nferrite in the weld material. Increasing amounts of delta ferrite will result \nin a higher ratio as defined in S7 .10. Alloys with the high nickel or \nmolybdenum content of S7 .1 may not form delta fenite and therefore may \nnot be sensitive to this test. \nS7.2 When specified by the purchase order, one sample \nfrom each lot of tubing (See 13.9.2) shall be subjected to \ntesting in a boiling mixture of 50 % reagent grade hydrochloric \nacid and 50 % water. \nS7 .3 Approximately 2-in. long samples shall be prepared \nfrom a production length of tubing. Shorter, 1-in. samples may \nbe used for small diameter (\u00bd-in. and below) tubing. Split the \nsample longitudinally to allow for easy micrometer measure\u00ad\nments. The sample may be one piece which contains the weld \nand at least 90\u00b0 of base-metal to one side of the weld. \nAlternately, the sample may be two separate pieces with one \ncontaining the weld and a similar size section from the balance \nof the tube opposite the weld consisting of 100 % base metal. \nRemove all burrs and sharp edges by lightly grinding. Remove \ndust and grease by cleaning with soap and water or other \nsuitable solvents. Then, place sample(s) in the flask. It is not \nrecommended to test more than four samples together, or to \nmix alloy types. \nS7.4 Prepare the hydrochloric acid solution by slowly add\u00ad\ning reagent grade (approximately 37 %) hydrochloric acid to \nan equal volume of distilled water. (Warning-Protect eyes \nand use rubber gloves when handling acid. Mixing shall be \ndone under a hood and testing shall be run under a hood.) \nS7.5 The test container shall be a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask \nequipped with ground-glass joints and an Ahlin condenser. The \nvolume of the solution shall be approximately 700 mL. \nS7 .6 Measure the thickness of the tube at five locations \nalong the weld area and at five locations along the base-metal \nsection. In both cases, take measurements at approximately \nequal longitudinal intervals along the section lengths. Make \nthese measurements with a sharp pointed micrometer accurate \nto at least 0.001 in. The micrometer must be suitable for \nmeasuring the small features in the surface after testing. \nTypical pin micrometers have tapered anvils with a tip radius \nof less than 0.015 in. \nS7.7 Immerse the samples into the solution. Add boiling \nchips and bring to a boil. Allow the chips to remain boiling \nthroughout the test. The time of testing shall be that which is \nrequired to remove 40 to 60 % of the original base-metal ",
