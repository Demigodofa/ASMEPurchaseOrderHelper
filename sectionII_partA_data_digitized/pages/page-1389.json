Small \noutside diameter tubes are defined as those less than 0.500 in. (12.7 mm] in outside diameter and light wall tubes as those less than 0.049 In. (1.2 mm] in average wall \nthickness (0.044 in. (1 mm] in minimum wall thickness). \n\"The titanium content shall be not less than five times the carbon content and not more than 0.70 %. \nF-fhe titanium content shall be not less than four times the carbon content and not more than 0.70 %. \n\"'The columbium plus tantalum content shall be not less than ten times the carbon content and not more than 1.1 0 %. \n1-tfhe columblum plus tantalum content shall be not less than eight times the carbon content and not more than 1.1 0 %. \n3.1.10 Specification designation, and \n3 .1.11 Special requirements or exceptions to the specifica\u00ad\ntion. \n4. Materials and Manufacture \n4.1 Manufacture: \n4.1.1 The pipe shall be made by a machine-welding or an \nautomatic-welding process, welding from one or both sides and \nproducing full penetration welds with no addition of filler \nmetal in the welding operation. \n4.1.2 Weld repairs, with the addition of compatible filler \nmetal, may be made to the weld joint in accordance with the \nrequirements of the section on Repair by Welding of Specifi\u00ad\ncation A999/A999M. \n4.1.3 Prior to final heat treatment of the pipe, the weld bead \nmust be cold-worked by methods such as forging, planishing, \ndrawing, swaging or bead rolling so as to obtain a flush \ncondition on the inside and outside of the pipe. Undercuts shall \nbe limited to shallow rounded depressions ofless than 0.005 in. \n[0.127 mm] deep on either the inside or outside surface of the \npipe with no encroachment of the minimum permitted wall \nthickness. \n4.1.4 The pipe shall be pickled free of scale. When bright \nannealing is used, pickling is not necessary. \n4.2 Heat Treatment: \n4.2.1 All pipe shall be furnished in the heat-treated condi\u00ad\ntion. The heat-treatment procedure, except for H grades, \nS30815, N08367 and S31254, shall consist of heating the pipe \nto a minimum temperature of 1900 \u00b0P [1040 \u00b0C] and quench\u00ad\ning in water or rapidly cooling by other means. \n4.2.2 All H grades and S30815 shall be furnished in the \nsolution-treated condition. The minimum solution treating \ntemperature for Grades TP321H, TP347H, and TP348H shall \nbe 2000 \u00b0P [1100 \u00b0C] and for Grades TP304H and TP316H, \n1900 \u00b0P [1040 \u00b0C]. The minimum temperature for S30815 \nshall be 1920 \u00b0P [1050 \u00b0C]. \n4.2.3 The heat-treatment procedure for S31254 shall consist \nof heating the pipe to a minimum temperature of 2100 \u00b0P [1150 \n0 C] and quenching in water or rapidly cooling by other means. \n4.2.4 The heat-treatment procedure for S31727 and S32053 \nshall consist of heating the pipe to a minimum temperature of \n1975 to 2155 \u00b0P [1080 to 1180 \u00b0C] and quenching in water or \nrapidly cooling by other means. \n4.2.5 UNS N08367 shall be solution annealed from 2025 \u00b0P \n[1110 \u00b0C] minimum followed by rapid quenching. \n4.3 H grades and S30815 shall have a minimum grain size \nof 7 or coarser when measured in accordance with Test \nMethods El12. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical composition \nprescribed in Table 2. \n5.2 When specified on the purchase order, a product analy\u00ad\nsis shall be supplied from one tube or coil of steel per heat. The \nproduct analysis tolerance of Specification A480/A480M shall \napply. \n6. Tensile Requirements \n6.1 The tensile properties of the material shall conform to \nthe requirements prescribed in Table 3. \n7. Permissible Variations in Dimensions \n7 .1 Specified Diameter-The diameter at any point in each \nlength of pipe shall be within the tolerance specified in Table 1. \nTABLE 3 Tensile Requirements \nGrade UNS Tensile Yield \nDesignation Strength, Strength, \nmin min \nksi [MPa] ksi [MPa] \nTP201 S20100 75 [515] 38 [260] \nTP201LN S20153 95 [665] 45 [310] \nTP304L S30403 70 (485] 25 (170] \nTP316L S31603 70 [485] 25 [170] \nTP304 S30400 75 (515] 30 [205] \nTP304H S30409 75 [515] 30 (205] \nTP309CB S30940 75 [515] 30 (205] \nTP309S S30908 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP310Cb S31040 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP310S S31008 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP316 S31600 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP316H S31609 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP317 S31700 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP317L S31703 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP321 S32100 75 [515] 30 (205] \nTP321H S32109 75 [515] 30 (205] \nTP347 S34700 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP347H S34709 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP348 S34800 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP348H S34809 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTPXM-10 S21900 90 [620] 50 [345] \nTPXM-11 S21903 90 [620] 50 [345] \nTPXM-15 S38100 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTPXM-29 S24000 100 (690] 55 [380] \nTPXM-19 S20910 100 (690] 55 [380] \nTP304N S30451 80 (550] 35 [240] \nTP316N S31651 80 [550] 35 [240] \nTP304LN S30453 75 [515] 30 [205] \nTP316LN S31653 75 [515] 30 [205] \nS31254 94 [650] 44 [300] \nS31727 80 [550] 36 [245] \nS32053 93 [640] 43 [295] \nS30815 87 [600] 45 [310] \nN08367 \nts0.187 100 [690] 45 [310] \n1>0.187 95 [655] 45 [310] \n1327 ",
