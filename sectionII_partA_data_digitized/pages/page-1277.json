[50 \nmm] in thickness unless otherwise agreed to. \n6. Chemical Requirements \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to \nchemical composition prescribed in Table 1 unless otherwise \nmodified in accordance with Supplementary Requirement S 17, \nVacuum Carbon-Deoxidized Steel, in Specification A20/ \nA20M. \n7. Mechanical Requirements \n7 .1 Tension Tests-The material as represented by the ten\u00ad\nsion test specimens shall conform to the requirements shown in \nTable 2. \n7.1.1 For nominal plate thicknesses of\u00be in. [20 mm] and \nunder, when requirements for elongation in 2 in. [50 mm] are \nto be determined, the 1 \u00bd-in. [40-mm] wide rectangular speci\u00ad\nmen may be used for the tension test, and the elongation may \nbe determined in a 2-in. [50-mm] gage length that includes the \nfracture and that shows the greatest elongation. \nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS \nSupplementary requirements shall not apply unless specified in the purchase order. \nA list of standardized supplementary requirements for use at the option of the purchaser is included \nin Specification A20/ A20M. Several of those considered suitable for use with this specification are \nlisted below by title. Other tests may be performed by agreement between the supplier and the \npurchaser. \nS 1. Vacuum Treatment, \nS2. Product Analysis, \nS3. Simulated Post-Weld Heat Treatment of Mechanical \nTest Coupons, \nS5. Charpy V-Notch Impact Tests, \nS8.
