Scope \n1. 1 This specification covers steel plates produced by the \nthermo-mechanical control process (TMCP). The plates are \nintended primarily for use in welded pressure vessels. A \ndescription of the TMCP method is given in Appendix XL \n1.2 Due to the inherent characteristics of the TMCP method, \nthe plates cannot be formed at elevated temperatures without \nsustaining significant losses in strength and toughness. Except \nfor Grade G, the plates may be formed and post-weld heat\u00ad\ntreated at temperatures not exceeding 1200\u00b0F [650\u00b0C], provid\u00ad\ning the requirements of 6.1 are met. Grade G plates may be \nformed at temperatures not exceeding 985\u00b0F [530\u00b0C] provided \nthe requirements of 6.1 are met. \n1.3 The maximum permitted nominal thickness of plates \nfurnished to this specification is 4 in. [100 mm] for Grades A, \nB, and C; 1.5 in. [40 mm] for Grades D, E, and F; and 2 in. \n[50 mm] for Grade G. \n1.4 Grade G is susceptible to magnetization. Use of magnets \nin handling after heat treatment should be avoided if residual \nmagnetism would be detrimental to subsequent fabrication or \nservice. \n1.5 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem are not exact equivalents. Therefore, each system must \nbe used independently of the other. Combining values from the \ntwo systems may result in nonconformance with this specifi\u00ad\ncation. \n1.6 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA20/ A20M Specification for General Requirements for Steel \nPlates for Pressure Vessels \nA435/A435M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic \nExamination of Steel Plates \nA577/A577M Specification for Ultrasonic Angle-Beam Ex\u00ad\namination of Steel Plates \nA578/A578M Specification for Straight-Beam Ultrasonic \nExamination of Rolled Steel Plates for Special Applica\u00ad\ntions \n3. General Requirements and Ordering Information \n3.1 Plates supplied to this product specification shall con\u00ad\nform to Specification A20/A20M, which outlines the testing \nand retesting methods and procedures, permissible variations \nin dimensions, quality and repair of defects, marking, loading, \netc. \n3.2 Specification A20/A20M also establishes the rules for \nordering information that should be complied with when \npurchasing plates to this specification. \n3.2.1 If the plates are to be subjected to warm forming or \npost-weld heat treatment, the order must indicate the tempera\u00ad\ntures and times-at-temperature that will be utilized in such \noperations. (See 6.1 and Specification A20/A20M, Supplemen\u00ad\ntary Requirement S3.) \n3.3 In addition to the basic requirements of this \nspecification, certain supplementary requirements are available \nwhen additional control, testing, or examination is required to \nmeet end use requirements.
