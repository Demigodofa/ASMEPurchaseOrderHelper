A ASME B18.2.2 in the size range over 1 ½ in. provides dimensions only for heavy hex nuts. Refer to 8.3.1. 
8 Proof loads for nuts of larger dimensions or other thread series may be calculated by multiplying the thread stress area times the proof stress in the notes to Table 3 
or Table S1, 1, The proof load for jam nuts shall be 46 % of the tabulated load.

A ASME B 18.2.4.6M in the size range over M36 provides dimensions only for heavy hex nuts. Refer to 7.3.1. 
8 Proof loads for nuts of larger dimensions or other thread series may be calculated by multiplying the thread stress area times the proof stress in the notes to Table 4 
or Table S1 .2. The proof load for jam nuts shall be 46 % of the tabulated load. 
SS. Control of Product by Heat Number 
S5.1 When control of nuts by actual heat analysis is 
required and this supplementary requirement is specified, the 
manufacturer shall identify the completed nuts in each ship­
ment by the actual heat number. When this supplementary 
requirement is specified, a certificate including the results of 
the actual production tests of each test lot together with the heat 
chemical analysis shall be furnished by the manufacturer. 
S6. Grain Size Requirements for Non H Grade Austenitic 
Steels Used Above 1000 °F 
S6.l For design metal temperatures above 1000 °F [540 
°C], the material shall have a grain size of No. 7 or coarser as 
determined in accordance with Test Methods Ell2. The grain 
size so determined shall be reported on the Certificate of Test. 
S7. Coating on Nuts 
S7.1 It is the purchaser's responsibility to specify in the 
purchase order all information required by the coating facility. 
Examples of such information may include but are not limited 
to the following: 
S7.l.1 Reference to the appropriate coating specification 
and type, thickness, location, modification to dimensions, and 
hydrogen embrittlement relief. 
258 
Norn S7.1-Modification of thread dimensions may result in loss of 
load carrying ability. 
S7.l.2 Reference to Specifications A153/A153M, B633, 
B695, B696, B766, F1941/F1941M, F2329/F2329M, or Test 
Method F1940, or other standards. 
S8. Marking Coated Nuts 
S8.1 Nuts coated with zinc shall have ZN marked after the 
grade symbol. Nuts coated with cadmium shall have CD 
marked after the grade symbol. 
Norn SS.1-As an example, tbe marking for zinc-coated 2H bolting 
components will now be 2HZN rather than 2H*. 
S9. Proof Load Testing 
S9.1 Proof load tests of nuts made to dimensions, thread 
pitch, and configurations other than those covered in Table 3 or 
Table 4 shall be made using loads agreed upon between the 
manufacturer and the purchaser. 
S10. 100 % Hardness Testing of Grade 2HM and 7M 
S 10.1 Each nut shall be tested for hardness by indentation 
method and shall meet the requirements specified in Table 2.
