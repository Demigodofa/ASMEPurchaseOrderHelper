A See Specification A20/A20M for elongation adjustments. 
B Measured on round specimen. 
c Measured on flat specimen. 
4.2 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and 
shall conform to the fine grain size requirement of Specifica­
tion A20/ A20M. 
5. Heat Treatment 
5.1 All plates shall be normalized and tempered except as 
allowed by 5.2. The minimwn normalizing temperature for 
Grade 22V shall be 1650°F [900°C]. The minimum normaliz­
ing temperature for Grade 23V shall be 1850°F [1010°C]. The 
minimwn tempering temperature shall be 1250°F [675°C]. 
5.2 Plates ordered without the heat treatment required by 
5.1 shall be furnished in either the stress-relieved or the 
annealed condition. Heat treatment of plates so ordered, to 
conform to 5.1 and to Table 1, shall be the responsibility of the 
purchaser. 
6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 The steel shall conform to the requirements as to 
chemical composition shown in Table 2. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Tension Test Requirements: 
7.1.1 The material as represented by the tension test speci­
mens shall conform to the requirements of Table 1. 
7.2 Notch Toughness Requirements: 
7.2.1 A transverse Charpy V-notch test from each plate as 
heat-treated shall have a minimum energy absorption value of 
40 ft•lbf [54 J] average of three specimens and 35 ft·lbf [48 J] 
for one specimen only in the set. 
7 .2.2 The notch toughness test temperature shall be 0°F 
[-l8°C]. 
8. Keywords
