Terminology \n3.l Definitions: \n3.1.1 For definitions of terms pertaining to mechanical \ntesting of steel products not otherwise listed in this section, \nreference should be made to Terminology E6 and Terminology \nA941. \n3.2 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.2. l longitudinal test, n-unless specifically defined \notherwise, signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is \nparallel to the direction of the greatest extension of the steel \nduring rolling or forging. \n3.2.1.1 Discussion-The stress applied to a longitudinal \ntension test specimen is in the direction of the greatest \nextension, and the axis of the fold of a longitudinal bend test \nspecimen is at right angles to the direction of greatest extension \n(see Fig. 1, Fig. 2a, and Fig. 2b). \n3.2.2 radial test, n-unless specifically defined otherwise, \nsignifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen is perpen\u00ad\ndicular to the axis of the product and coincident with one of the \nradii of a circle drawn with a point on the axis of the product \nas a center (see Fig. 2a). \n3.2.3 tangential test, n-unless specifically defined \notherwise, signifies that the lengthwise axis of the specimen \nperpendicular to a plane containing the axis of the product and \ntangent to a circle drawn with a point on the axis of the \nproductas a center (see Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b, Fig. 2c, and Fig. 2d). \n3.2.4 transition temperature, n-for specification purposes, \nthe transition temperature is the temperature at which the \ndesignated material test value equals or exceeds a specified \nminimum test value. \n3.2.4.1 Discussion-Some of the many definitions of tran\u00ad\nsition temperature currently being used are: ( 1) the lowest \ntemperature at which the specimen exhibits 100 % fibrous \nfracture, (2) the tei;nperature where the fracture shows a 50 % \ncrystalline and a 50 % fibrous appearance, ( 3) the temperature \ncorresponding to the energy value 50 % of the difference \n585 \nFIG. 1 Relation of Test Coupons and Test Specimens to Rolling \nDirection or Extension (Applicable to General Wrought Products) ",
