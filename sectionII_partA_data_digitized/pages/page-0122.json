Terminology \n3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.1.1 as-rolled-for plates, the condition of a plate that has \nbeen hot-rolled and will not be or has not yet been heat treated. \n3.1.1.1 Discussion-The term as-rolled by itself is not \nmeant to refer to plates that have been hot-rolled using control\u00ad\nrolling (CR), direct quench (DQT), thermo-mechanical control \nrolling (TMCP), recrystalization control rolling (RCR), or any \nsimilar methods that ate intended to produce a set of properties \nthat are not normally achievable were they not employed. The \nterm as-rolled is to be distinguished from the established term \n70 \nplate-as-rolled that does not define the actual condition of a \nplate, but defines the singular product of a slab or ingot that has \nbeen hot-rolled \n3.1.2 coil-hot-rolled steel in coil form for processing into \nfinished plates. \n3.1.3 exclusive-when used in relation to ranges, as for \nranges of thicknesses in the tables of permissible variations in \ndimensions, the term is intended to exclude only the greater \nvalue of the range. Thus, a range from 60 to 72 in. [1500 to \n1800 mm] exclusive includes 60 in. [1500 mm], but does not \ninclude 72 in. [1800 mm]. \n3.1.4 heat treatment terms-see 3.1.11, and Terminology \nA941. \n3.1.5 hot forming-a forming operation producing penna\u00ad\nnent deformation, performed after the plate has been heated to \nthe temperature required to produce grain refinement. \n3.1.6 hot-rolled (hot rolling)-for plates, the process de\u00ad\nscribed for a plate that has been rolled from a slab or ingot \nwhose starting temperature is suitably above the recrystalliza\u00ad\ntion temperature of the metal to be rolled. \n3.1.6.1 Discussion-Hot-rolled may be used in conjunction \nwith any rolling process to more effectively describe a specific \ncondition, for example; hot-rolled as-rolled; hot-rolled control\u00ad\nrolled, etc. \n3.1.7 manufacturer-the organization that directly controls \nthe conversion of steel ingots or slabs, by hot rolling, into \nplate-as-rolled or into coil; and for plates produced from \nplate-as-rolled, the organization that directly controls, or is \nresponsible for, one or more of the operations involved in \nfinishing the plates. Such finishing operations include leveling, \ncutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, heat treat\u00ad\nment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for shipment, \nand certification. \n3.1.7.1 Discussion-The finishing operations need not be \ndone by the organization that did the hot rolling of the plate. \nFor plates produced from coil, see also 3.1.2. \n3.1.8 mill edge-the normal edge produced by rolling be\u00ad\ntween horizontal finishing rolls. A mill edge does not conform \nto any definite contour. Mill edge plates have two mill edges \nand two trimmed edges. \n3.1.8.1 Discussion-Mill edge plates may at times be side\u00ad\ntrimmed on one or both sides at the discretion of the manu\u00ad\nfacturer. \n3.1.9 plate identifier-the alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric \ndesignation used to identify the plate. \n3.1.10 plates-flat hot-rolled steel, ordered to thickness or \nweight and typically to width and length, commonly available \nby size as follows: \nWidth, in. [mm] \nOver 8 [200] \nOver 48 [1200] \nThickness, in. [mm] \nover 0.229 [6.0 mm and over] \nover 0.179 [4.6 mm and over] \n3.1.10.1 Discussion-Steel plates are available in various \nthickness, width, and length combinations dependent upon \nequipment and processing capabilities of various manufactur\u00ad\ners and processors. Historic limitations of a plate based upon \ndimensions (thickness, width, and length) do not take into ",
