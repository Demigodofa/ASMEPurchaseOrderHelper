Terminology \n3.1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: \n3.1.1 Steel Types: \n3.1.2 carbon steel, n-designation for steel when no mini\u00ad\nmum content is specified or required for aluminum, chromium, \ncobalt, columbium, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, tungsten, \nvanadium, zirconium, or any element added to obtain a desired \nalloying effect; when the specified minimum for copper does \nnot exceed 0.40 %; or when the maximum content specified for \nany of the following elements does not exceed the percentages \nnoted: manganese 1.65, silicon 0.60, or copper 0.60. \n3 The last approved version of this historical standard is referenced on \nwww.astm.org. \n4 Available from Standardization Documents Order Desk, DODSSP, Bldg. 4, \nSection D, 700 Robbins Ave., Philadelphia, PA 19111-5098, http:// \nwww.dodssp.daps.mil. \n3.1.2.1 Discussion-In all carbon steels small quantities of \ncertain residual elements unavoidably retained from raw ma\u00ad\nterials are sometimes found which are not specified or required, \nsuch as copper, nickel, molybdenum, chromium, and so forth. \nThese elements are considered as incidental and are not \nnormally determined or reported. \n3.1.3 high-strength, low-alloy steel, n-specific group of \nsteels in which higher strength, and in some cases additional \nresistance to atmospheric corrosion or improved formability, \nare obtained by moderate amounts of one or more alloying \nelements. \n3.1.4 Product Types: \n3.1.5 hot-rolled sheet, n-manufactured by hot-rolling slabs \nin a continuous mill to the required thickness and can be \nsupplied in coils or cut lengths as specified. \n( 1) Hot-rolled carbon steel sheet is commonly classified by \nsize as follows: \nWidth, in. \nAll WidthsA \nCoils and Cut Lengths \nThickness, in. \n0.027 to 0.230, excl \nA Hot-rolled sheet in coils and cut lengths less than 12 in. in width must have cut \nedges. Hot-rolled material with mill edges 12 in. and less in width is considered \nhot-rolled strip. \nWidth, mm \nAll WidthsA \nCoils and Cut Lengths \nThickness, mm \n0.7 to 6.0, excl \nA Hot-rolled sheet in coils and cut lengths less than 300 mm. in width must have \ncut edges. Hot-rolled material with mill edges 300 mm and less in width is \nconsidered hot-rolled strip. \n(2) Hot-rolled high-strength low-alloy steel sheet is com\u00ad\nmonly classified by size as follows: \nWidth, in. \nAll WidthsA \nCoils and Cut Lengths \nThickness, in. \n0.031 to 0.230, excl \nA Hot-rolled sheet in coils and cut lengths less than 12 in. in width must have cut \nedges. Hot-rolled material with mill edges 12 in. and less in width is considered \nhot-rolled strip. \nWidth, in. \nAll WidthsA \nCoils and Cut Lengths \nThickness, mm \n0.8 to 6.0, excl \n-A Hot-rollecl-sheetin coils and-cut lengths-less than 300-mm-i11 wiatlcl must-have-cut -\nedges. Hot-rolled material with mill edges 300 mm and less in width is considered \nhot-rolled strip. \n979 \nNoTE 2-The changes in width limits with the publication of A568/ \nA568M - 06a result in a change in tensile testing direction for material \nfrom 0.180 in. [4.5 mm] to 0.230 in. exclusive [6.0 mm exclusive] over \n48 in. [1200 mm] wide. Material formerly tested in the transverse \ndirection will be tested in the longitudinal direction. This is expected to \nresult in some changes in reported properties. The purchaser is advised to \ndiscuss this change with the supplier. \n3.1.6 cold-rolled sheet, n-manufactured from hot-rolled \ndescaled coils by cold reducing to the desired thickness, \ngenerally followed by annealing to recrystallize the grain \nstructure. If the sheet is not annealed after cold reduction it is \nknown as full hard with a hardness of 84 HRB minimum and \ncan be used for certain applications where ductility and flatness \nare not required. \n( 1) Cold-rolled carbon sheet is commonly classified by size \nas follows: ",
