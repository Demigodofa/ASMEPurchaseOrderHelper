When only one part is produced, it shall \nbe hardness tested as required. The purchaser is permitted to \nverify that the requirement has been met by testing at any \nlocation on any part provided such testing does not render the \npart useless. \n9.6.2 When the reduced number of tension tests permitted \nby 9.5.1 is applied, additional hardness tests shall be made on \nparts or samples as defined in 9.2 distributed throughout the \ncharge. At least eight samples shall be checked from each batch \nload and a least one check/h shall be made from a continuous \nrun. When the furnace charge is less than eight parts, each part \nshall be checked. If any hardness test result falls outside the \nprescribed limits, the entire lot of parts shall be reheat treated \nand the requirements of 9.5.1 shall apply. \n9.7 Fatigue Tests-When specified in the order, the fatigue \nstrength of austenitic stainless steel components intended for \nservice above 1000 \u00b0F [540 \u00b0C] shall be determined in \naccordance with Section S18. \n10. Corrosion Testing \n10.1 Corrosion testing is not required by this specification. \n10.2 Austenitic stainless steels shall be capable of meeting \nthe intergranular c01rnsion test requirements described in \nSection Sll. \n10.3 When required by the purchaser, the stainless steels \nshall be tested in the final heat treated condition for pitting or \ncrevice corrosion resistance according to the procedures de\u00ad\nscribed in Section S12. \n10.4 Austenitic-ferritic stainless steels shall be capable of \nmeeting the test requirements described in Section S13. \n11. Product Analysis \n11.1 The purchaser is permitted to make a product analysis \non parts supplied to this specification. Samples for analysis \nshall be taken from midway between the center and surface of \nsolid parts, midway between the inner and outer surfaces of \nhollow parts, midway between the center and surface of \nfull-size prolongations, or from broken mechanical test speci\u00ad\nmens. The chemical composition thus determined shall con\u00ad\nform to Table 1 with the tolerances as stated in Table 4. \n12. Reheat Treatment \n12.1 If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform to \nthe requirements specified, the manufacturer is permitted to \nreheat treat the paits and repeat the tests specified in Section 9, \nbut not more than twice. \n13. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion \nProtection \n13.1 The requirements of Specification A961/A961M apply \nto hot isostatically pressed finished parts. \n13.2 In addition to the requirements of Specification A961/ \nA961M, the following requirements apply: \n13.2.1 The parts shall be free of machining burrs, and \nmachined surfaces, other than surfaces having special \nTABLE 4 Product Analysis Tolerances for Stainless SteelsA \nTolerance Over \nLimit or Maximum of the Maximum \nElements Specified Range, % Limit or Under \nthe Minimum \nLimit \nCarbon 0.030, incl 0.005 \nover 0.030 to 0.20 incl 0.01 \nManganese to 1.00, incl 0.03 \nover 1.00 to 3.00, incl 0.04 \nover 3.00 to 6.00 0.05 \nover 6.00 to 10.00 0.06 \nPhosphorus to 0.040, incl 0.005 \nSulfur to 0.030, incl 0.005 \nSilicon to 1.00, incl 0.05 \nover 1.00 to 5.00, incl 0.10 \nChromium over 10.00 to 15.00, incl 0.15 \nover 15.00 to 20.00, incl 0.20 \nover 20.00 to 30.00, incl 0.25 \nNickel to 1.00, incl 0.03 \nover 1.00 to 5.00, incl 0.07 \nover 5.00 to 10.00, incl 0.10 \nover 10.00 to 20.00, incl 0.15 \nover 20.00 to 30.00, incl 0.20 \nover 30.00 to 40,00, incl 0.25 \nMolybdenum to 0.20 incl 0.01 \nover 0.20 to 0.60, incl 0.03 \nover 0.60 to 2.00, incl 0.05 \nover 2.00 to 7.00, incl 0.10 \nTitanium all ranges 0.05 \nColumbium+tantalum all ranges 0.05 \nTantalum to 0.1 o, incl 0.02 \nCobalt 0.05 to 0.20, incl 0.01 8 \nNitrogen to 0.19 incl 0.01 \nover 0.19 to 0.25 0.02 \nover 0.25 to 0.35 0.03 \nover 0.35 to 0.45 0.04 \nover 0.45 to 0.60 0.05 \nColumbium 0 0.05 to 0.20, incl 0.01 \nAluminum to 0.05 incl 0.01 \nVanadium to 0.10 incl 0.01 \nover 0.1 O to 0.25 incl 0.02 \nCerium 0.03 to 0.08 -0.005 \n+0.01 \nTungsten to 1 .00, incl 0.04 \nCopper to 0.50, incl 0.03 \nOver 0.50 to 1.00, incl 0.05 \nOver 1.00 to 3.00, incl 0.10 \nOver 3.00 to 5.00, incl 0.15 \nA This table does not apply to heat analysis. \n8 Product analysis limits for cobalt under 0.05 % have not been established and \nthe producer should be consulted for those limits. \n\u00b0The terms Niobium (Nb) and Columbium (Cb) are alternate names for the same \nelement. \nrequirements, shall have a surface finish not to exceed Ra 250 \nmicroinch [6.3 micrometre] (arithmetic average) roughness \nheight. \n14.
