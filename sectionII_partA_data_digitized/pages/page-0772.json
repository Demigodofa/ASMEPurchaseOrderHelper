Scope \n1. 1 This specification covers austenitic ductile iron castings, \nwhich are used primarily for their resistance to heat, conosion, \nand wear, and for other special purposes. \n1.2 Austenitic ductile iron, also known as austenitic nodular \niron or austenitic spheroidal iron, is characterized by having its \ngraphite substantially in a spheroidal form and substantially \nfree of flake graphite. It contains some carbides and sufficient \nalloy content to produce an austenitic structure. \n1.3 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in \neach system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each \nsystem shall be used independently of the other. Combining \nvalues from the two systems may result in nonconformance \nwith the standard. \n1.4 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2. Referenced Documents \n2.1 ASTM Standards: \nA247 Test Method for Evaluating the Microstructure of \nGraphite in Iron Castings \nA370 Test Methods and Definitions for Mechanical Testing \nof Steel Products \nE8/E8M Test Methods for Tension Testing of Metallic Ma\u00ad\nterials \nElO Test Method for Brinell Hardness of Metallic Materials \n722 \nE30 Test Methods for Chemical Analysis of Fenoalloys \nE59 Practice for Sampling Steel and Iron for Determination \nof Chemical Composition \nE351 Test Methods for Chemical Analysis of Cast Iron-All \nTypes \n3. Ordering Information \n3.1 Orders for material to this specification shall include the \nfollowing information: \n3.1.1 ASTM designation, \n3.1.2 Type of austenitic ductile iron required (see 6.1), \n3.1.3 Heat treatment options (see 4.3 - 4.6), \n3.1.4 DELETED \n3.1.5 Size and number of test bars required (see 9.1 - 9.4 \nand 10.1), \n3.1.6 Special tests, if required (see 12.1), \n3.1.7 DELETED \n3.1.8 Different preparation for delivery requirements, if \nneeded (see 15.1). \n4. Manufacture \n4.1 Melting may be done in any furnaces that produce \ncastings meeting the chemical and mechanical requirements \noutlined in this specification. These include cupolas, air \nfurnaces, electric furnaces, crucible furnaces, and so forth. \nNodularizing and inoculation practice shall be optional with \nthe foundry to produce a microstructure in accordance with 1.2 \nand Test Method A24 7. \n4.2 Austenitic ductile iron castings may be supplied in \neither the as-cast or the heat-treated condition. \n4.3 By agreement between the manufacturer and the \npurchaser, the castings may be stress relieved by heating to \n1150 to 1200 \u00b0F [620 to 650 \u00b0C] for not less than 1 h and not \nfor more than 2 h per inch [25 mm] of thickness in the thickest \nsection. Heating and cooling shall be uniform and shall not be \nmore than 400 \u00b0FAl [220 \u00b0CA1] for castings less than 1 in. \n[25 mm] in maximum thickness and shall be not more than \n400 \u00b0FAl [220 \u00b0CA1] divided by the maximum section thick\u00ad\nness in inches [25 mm] for thicker castings.
