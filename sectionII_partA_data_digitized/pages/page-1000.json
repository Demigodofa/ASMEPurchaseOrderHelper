Rejected lots may be screened and resubmitted \nfor visual and dimensional examination. All defective items \nshall be replaced with acceptable items prior to lot acceptance. \n28.1.4 Sampling for Chemical Analysis-One sample for \nchemical analysis shall be selected from each of two pipes \nchosen from each lot. A lot shall be all material poured from \none heat. \n28.1.5 Sampling for Tension and Bend Test-One sample \nshall be taken from each lot. A lot shall consist of all pipe of the \nsame outside diameter and wall thickness manufactured during \nan 8-h shift from the same heat of steel, and heat treated under \nthe same conditions of temperature and time in a single charge \nin a batch type furnace, or heat treated under the same \ncondition in a continuous furnace, and presented for inspection \nat the same time. \n28.1.6 Hydrostatic and Ultrasonic Tests-Each pipe shall be \ntested by the ultrasonic (when specified) and hydrostatic tests. \n28.1.7 Pipe shall be free from heavy oxide or scale. The \ninternal surface of hot finished ferritic steel pipe shall be \npickled or blast cleaned to a free of scale condition equivalent \nto the CSa2 visual standard listed in SSPC-SP6. Cleaning shall \nbe performed in accordance with a written procedure that has \nbeen shown to be effective. This procedure shall be available \nfor audit. \n28.1.8 In addition to the marking in Specification A450/ \nA450M, each length of pipe \u00bc in. outside diameter and larger \nshall be marked with the following listed information. Marking \nshall be in accordance with FED-STD-183 and MIL-STD-792. \n(a) Nominal Pipe Size Schedule and Length (b) Heat or lot \n----------->c\u00b7dentifi.eatien;'lumber. \n28.1.9 Pipe shall be straight to within the tolerances speci\u00ad\nfied in Table 3. \n28.1.10 When specified, each pipe shall be ultrasonically \nexamined in accordance with MIL-STD-271, except that the \nnotch depth in the calibration standard shall be 5 % of the wall \nthickness or 0.005 in., whichever is greater. Any pipe which \nproduces an indication equal to or greater than 100 % of the \nindication from the calibration standard shall be rejected. \n28.1.11 The pipe shall be free from repair welds, welded \njoints, laps, laminations, seams, visible cracks, tears, grooves, \nslivers, pits, and other imperfections detrimental to the pipe as \ndetermined by visual and ultrasonic examination, or alternate \ntests, as specified. \n28.1.12 Pipe shall be uniform in quality and condition and \nhave a finish conforming to the best practice for standard \nquality pipe. Surface imperfections such as handling marks, \nstraightening marks, light mandrel and die marks, shallow pits, \nand scale pattern will not be considered injurious if the \nimperfections are removable within the tolerances specified for \nwall thickness or 0.005 in., whichever is greater. The bottom of \nimperfections shall be visible and the profile shall be rounded \nand faired-in. \n28.1.13 No weld repair by the manufacturer is permitted. \n28.1.14 Preservation shall be level A or commercial, and \npacking shall b\u00a2 level A, B, or commercial, as specified. Level \nA preservation and level A or B packing shall be in accordance \nwith MIL-STD-163 and commercial preservation and packing \nshall be in accordance with Practices A 700 or Practice D3951. \n29.
