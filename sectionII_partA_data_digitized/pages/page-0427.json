This \nmay be particularly important when the alloy cladding involves the use of \nwelded components in the explosion bonded clad manufacturing process. \nIt is incumbent on the purchaser to make the clad manufacturer aware of \nany such restrictions or applications at time of order. \n4.2 In addition to the basic requirements of this specification \nand the backing steel specification, certain supplementary \nrequirements are available when additional control, testing, or \nexamination is required to meet end use requirements. The \npurchaser is referred to the listed supplementary requirements \nin this specification and to the detailed requirements in \nSpecification A20/A20M. \n4.3 If the requirements of this specification are in conflict \nwith the requirements of Specification A20/A20M, the require\u00ad\nments of this specification shall prevail. \n5. Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 Process: \n5.1.1 The steel shall be made by the open-heaiih, electric\u00ad\nfumace, or basic-oxygen processes, or by secondary processes \nwhereby steel made from these primary processes is remelted \nusing, but not limited to electroslag remelting or vacuum-arc \nremelting processes. \n5.1.2 The alloy-cladding metal may be metallurgically \nbonded to the base metal by any method that will produce a \nclad steel that will conform to the requirements of this \nspecification. \n5.1.3 For explosively bonded products, the alloy cladding \nmetal may be comprised of two or more separate alloy plates \nor sheets completely welded together to fonn a single fabri\u00ad\ncated component. \n5.2 Heat Treatment-Unless otherwise specified or agreed \nupon between the purchaser and the manufacturer, all plates \nshall be furnished in the normalized, tempered, normalized and \ntempered, or quenched and tempered condition as permitted by \nthe backing steel specification. Stress relieving of the compos\u00ad\nite plate by heating subcritically is permitted, provided the \ntemperature is 75\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) or more below the minimum \ntempering temperature (when tempered). \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The composite plate shall conform to any desired \ncombination of alloy-cladding metal and base metal as de\u00ad\nscribed in 6.2 and 6.3 and as agreed upon between the \npurchaser and the manufacturer. \n6.2 Alloy Cladding Metal-The alloy-cladding metal speci\u00ad\nfied shall conform to the requirements as to chemical compo\u00ad\nsition prescribed for the respective chromium steel in Specifi\u00ad\ncation A240/A240M. \n6.3 Base Metal-The base metal shall be carbon steel or \nlow-alloy steel conforming to the ASTM specifications for \nsteels for pressure vessels or other as agreed by the purchaser \nand the manufacturer. The base metal shall conform to the \nchemical requirements of the specification to which it is \nordered. \n7. Mechanical Properties \n7.1 Tensile Requirements: \n7 .1.1 The tensile properties shall be determined by a tension \ntest of the composite plate for clad plates that meet all of the \nfollowing conditions. \n(I) The nominal composite gage is less than or equal to \n1 \u00bd in. (38 mm). \n(2) The specified minimum tensile strength of the base \nsteel is less than or equal to 70 000 psi ( 485 MPa). \n( 3) The specified minimum yield strength of the base steel \nis less than or equal to 40 000 psi (275 MPa). \nThe tensile properties thus determined shall be not less than \nthe minimum and not more than 5000 psi (35 MPa) over the \nmaximum prescribed in the specification for the base steel \nused. All other tensile test requirements of the specification for \nthe base steel shall be met. \n7 .1.2 The tensile properties shall be determined by a tension \ntest of the base steel only for clad plates that meet one of the \nfollowing conditions. The properties thus determined shall \nmeet all of the tensile test requirements for the base steel. \n(I) The composite gage is greater than 1 \u00bd in. (38 nnn). \n(2) The specified minimum tensile strength of the base \nsteel is greater than 70 000 psi (485 MPa). \n(3) The specified minimum yield strength of the base steel \nis greater than 40 000 psi (275 MPa). \n7 .1.3 If the cladding is for corrosion allowance only, the \ncladding need not be included in the tensile test. The tensile \nproperties thus determined shall meet the base steel require\u00ad\nments. \n7 .2 Tests for strength of the bond, when required, must be \nspecified by the purchaser and shall consist of one of the \nfollowing. \n7.2.1 Shear Strength-When required by the purchaser, the \nminimum shear strength of the alloy cladding and base metals \nshall be 20 000 psi (140 MPa). The shear test, when specified, \nshall be made in the manner indicated in Fig. 1. The minimum \ncladding thickness for.shear testing shall be 0.075 in. (1.9 mm) \nexclusive as ordered. Testing for shear strength for clad plates \nwith minimum cladding thickness of 0.075 in. (1.9 mm) or less \nshall be permitted upon agreement between the purchaser and \nthe manufacturer. \n375 \n7.2.2 Bond Strength-As an alternative to the shear strength \ntest provided in 7.2.1, or when agreed upon by the purchaser \nand the manufacturer, or both, three bend tests shall be made \nwith the alloy cladding in compression to determine the quality \nof the bond. These bend tests shall be made in the manner of \nthe tension tests indicated in Fig. 2 and shall be bent through an ",
