3. Terminology 
3 .1 Definitions of Terms Specific to This Standard: 
3.1.1 A lot shall consist of 200 ft [60 m] or fraction thereof 
of pipe from the same heat of steel. 
3.1.2 The description of a lot may be further restricted by 
use of Supplementary Requirement S14. 
4. Ordering Information 
4.1 The inquiry and order for material under this specifica-
tion should include the following information: 
4.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number oflengths), 
4.1.2 Name of material (steel pipe, electric-fusionwelded), 
4.1.3 Specification number, 
4.1.4 Grade and class designations (see 1.3), 
4.1.5 Size (inside or outside diameter, nominal or minimum 
wall thickness), 
4.1.6 Length (specific or random), 
4.1.7 End finish (11.4), 
4.1.8 Purchase options, if any (see 5.2.3, 11.3, 14.1 and 
Sections 16, 20.1, 21, 22 of Specification A530/A530M), and 
4.1.9 Supplementary requirements, if any (refer to Sl 
through S15). 
5. Materials and Manufacture 
5.1 Materials-The steel plate material shall conform to the 
requirements of the applicable plate specification for pipe 
grade ordered as listed in Table 1. 
5.2 Welding: 
5.2.1 The joints shall be double-welded, full-penetration 
welds made in accordance with procedures and by welders or 
welding operators qualified in accordance with the ASME 
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section IX. 
5.2.2 The welds shall be made either manually or automati­
cally by an electric process involving the deposition of filler 
metal. 
5.2.3 The welded joint shall have positive reinforcement at 
the center of each side of the weld, but not more than 1/s in. [3 
mm]. This reinforcement may be removed at the manufactur­
er's option or by agreement between the manufacturer and 
purchaser. The contour of the reinforcement shall be smooth, 
and the deposited metal shall be fused smoothly and uniformly 
into the plate surface. 
5.2.4 When radiographic examination in accordance with 
9.1 is to be used, the weld reinfor~ement shall be governed by 
the more restrictive provisions of UW-51 of Section VIII of 
the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code instead of 5.2.3 of 
this specification. 
5.3 Heat Treatment-All classes other than 10, 11, 12 and 
13 shall be heat treated in furnace controlled to ± 25 °F [15 
°C] and equipped with a recording pyrometer so that heating 
records are available. Heat treating after forming and welding 
shall be to one of the following: • 
5.3.1 Classes 20, 21, 22, and 23 pipe shall be uniformly 
heated within the post-weld heat-treatment temperature range 
indicated in Table 2 for a minimum of 1 h/in. [0.4 hr/cm] of 
thickness or 1 h, whichever is greater. 
5.3.2 Classes 30, 31, 32, and 33 pipe shall be uniformly 
heated to a temperature in the austenitizing range and not 
exceeding the maximum normalizing temperature indicated in 
Table 2 and subsequently cooled in air at room temperature. 
5.3.3 Classes 40, 41, 42, and 43 pipe shall be normalized in 
accordance with 5.3.2. After normalizing, the pipe shall be 
reheated to the tempering temperature indicated in Table 2 as a 
minimum and held at temperature for a minimum of ½ h/2n. 
[0.2 hr/cm] of thickness or ½ h, whichever is greater, and air 
cooled. 
5.3.4 Classes 50, 51, 52, and 53 pipe shall be uniformly 
heated to a temperature in the austenitizing range, and not 
exceeding· the maximum quenching temperature indicated in 
Table 2 and subsequently quenched in water or oil. After 
quenching the pipe shall be reheated to the tempering tempera­
ture indicated in Table 2 as a minimum and held at temperature 
for a minimum of ½ h/2n. [0.2 hr/cm] of thickness or ½ h, 
whichever is greater, and air cooled.
