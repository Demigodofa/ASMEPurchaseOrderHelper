and Precipitation-Heat Treated 
manufacturer only when Supplementary Requirement S57 of 
Specification A961/A961M is specified. 
9. Surface Finish, Appearance, and Corrosion Protection 
9.1 Forgings and finished parts shall conform to the require­
ments of Specification A961/A961M. 
10. Retests 
10.1 If any test specimen shows flaws or defective 
machining, it may be discarded and another specimen substi­
tuted. 
11. Rework and Retreatment 
11.1 If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform to 
the requirements specified, the manufacturer may reheat treat 
the forgings represented, and shall retest to the applicable 
requirements. 
11.2 Individually tested forgings meeting all requirements 
shall be acceptable. 
11.3 Repair by Welding-Weld repairs shall be permitted 
(see Supplementary Requirement S58 of Specification A961/ 
A961M) at the discretion of the manufacturer with the follow­
ing limitations and requirements: 
11.3.1 Repair by welding shall be made using welding 
procedures and welders qualified in accordance with ASME 
Section IX of the Code. The weld procedure qualification test 
shall also include impact tests of the weld metal and heat­
affected zone. All impact test specimens shall have the longi­
tudinal axis transverse to the weld and the base of the notch 
534 
normal to the weld surface. Weld specimens shall have the 
notch in weld metal and heat-affected zone specimens shall 
have the notch in the heat-affected zone. The specimens shall 
be as large as permitted by the weldment thickness. Where 
full-size specimens can be obtained and where there is suffi­
cient weldment thickness, the weld specimen shall be taken 
with one side of the specimen within 1/16 in. [l.6 mm] of the 
weld surface. Heat-affected zone impact test specimens shall 
be taken at the same depth and locations applicable to the 
forging in 7.1.3.1 and 7.1.3.2. When forgings are thermally 
treated after repair welding, the weld procedure test plate shall 
be subjected to the same thermal treatment. The mechanical 
properties of the weld procedure qualification test shall con­
form to Section 7. 
11.3.2 Defects shall be completely removed by chipping or 
grinding to sound metal as verified by magnetic particle, or 
liquid penetrant inspection prior to welding. 
11.3.3 For Grade LFl forgings, and LF2 forgings that are to 
be only stress-relieved after repair welding, the weld metal 
shall be deposited using carbon steel electrodes E 7015, E 
7016, or E 7018, complying with AWS A 5.1. For Grade LF2 
forgings in all other conditions of post-weld heat treatment, the 
weld metal shall be deposited using low-alloy steel electrodes 
E 7015-Al; E 7016-Al, or E 7018-Al complying with AWS 
5.5; for Grade LF3 forgings the weld metal shall be deposited 
using low-alloy steel electrodes E 8016-C2 or E 8018-C2 
complying with AWS A 5.5; for Grades LF5, LF9, and LF787 
forgings, the weld metal shall be deposited using low-alloy 
steel electrodes E 8016-C 1 or E 8018-C 1 complying with AWS
