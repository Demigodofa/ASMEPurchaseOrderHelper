Scope \n1.1 This specification covers two classes of fit-up and \nalignment quality straight-seam single- or double-welded aus\u00ad\ntenitic steel pipe intended for high-temperature and general \ncorrosive service. \nNom 1-When the impact test criterion for a low-temperature service \nwould be 15 ft-lbf [20 J] energy absorption or 15 mils [0.38 mm] lateral \nexpansion, some of the austenitic stainless steel grades covered by this \nspecification are accepted by certain pressure vessel or piping codes \nwithout the necessity of making the actual test. For example, Grades 304, \n304L, and 347 are accepted by the ASME Pressure Vessel Code, Section \nVIII Division 1, and by the Chemical Plant and Refinery Piping Code, \nANSI.B31.3 for service at temperatures as low as -425 \u00b0F [-250 \u00b0C] \nwithout qualification by impact tests. Other AISI stainless steel grades are \nusually accepted for service temperatures as low as -325 \u00b0F [-200 \u00b0C] \nwithout impact testing. Impact testing may, under certain circumstances, \nbe required. For example, materials with chromium or nickel content \noutside the AISI ranges, and for material with carbon content exceeding \n0.10 %, are required to be impact tested under the rules of ASME Section \nVIII Division 1 when service temperatures are lower than -50 \u00b0F [-45 \u00b0C] \n1.2 Grades TP304H, TP304N, TP316H, TP316N, TP321H, \nTP347H, and TP348H are modifications of Grades TP304, \nTP316, TP321, TP347, and TP348, and are intended for \nhigh-temperature service. \n1.3 Two classes of pipe are covered as follows: \n1.3.1 Class SW-Pipe, single-welded with no addition of \nfiller metal and \n1.3.2 Class DW-Pipe, double-welded with no addition of \nfiller metal. \n1.4 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for \npipe where a greater degree of testing is desired. These \nsupplementary requirements call for additional tests to be made \nand, when desired, one or more of these may be specified in the \norder. \n1.5 Table 1 lists the dimensions of welded stainless steel \npipe as shown in ANSI B36.19. Pipe having other dimensions \nmay be furnished provided such pipe complies with all other \nrequirements of this specification. \n1.6 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the \"M\" \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \n1.7 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n2.
