Materials and Manufacture \n5.1 Melting Practice - The steel shall be made by one \nor more of the following primary processes: open-hearth, \nbasic-oxygen, or electric-furnace. The primary melting \nmay incorporate separate degassing or refining and may \nbe followed by secondary melting using electroslag remelt\u00ad\ning or vacuum-arc remelting. Where secondary melting is \nemployed, the heat shall be defined as all of the ingots \nremelted from a single primary heat. \n5.2 Deoxidation: \n5.2.1 Unless otherwise specified, the steel shall be \nrimmed, capped, semi-killed, or killed at the producer's \noption. \n5.2.2 When required, the purchaser may specify the \nrequired deoxidation practice, dependent upon strength \ngrade specified, purchaser's methods of fabrication, and \nend use requirements. Killed steels can be produced to \ncoarse or fine austenitic grain size ( Supplementary Require\u00ad\nment Sl). \n5.3 Condition - Unless otherwise specified, the bars \nshall be furnished as-rolled and not pickled, blast cleaned, \nor oiled. At the producer's option, bars may be cleaned \nfor inspection. \n6. Chemical Composition \n6.1 The steel shall conform to the chemical require\u00ad\nments specified in Table 2. \n6.2 Leaded Steel - When required, lead may be speci\u00ad\nfied as an added element. When lead is specified as an \nadded element, a range from 0.15 to 0.35 % inclusive shall \nbe furnished. Such a steel is identified by adding the letter \nL after the grade designation, for example 60L [415L]. \n6.3 Copper-Bearing Steel - When required copper may \nbe specified as an added element. Copper-bearing steel is \nidentified by stating \"copper-bearing\" on the purchase \norder. \n6.4 When tension tests are waived in accordance with \n7 .1.1.2, chemistry consistent with the mechanical proper\u00ad\nties desired shall be applied. \n7. Mechanical Properties \n7.1 Tension Tests \n7.1.1 Requirements: \n7.1.1.1 The material as represented by the test \nspecimen shall conform to the applicable requirements in \nTable 1. \n7.1.1.2 Shapes less than 1 in. 2 [645 mm 2 ] in cross \nsection and bars (other than flats) less than\u00bd in. [12.5 mm] \nin thickness or diameter need not be subject to tension \ntests by the manufacturer. \n7.1.1.3 For material over\u00be in. [19 mm] in thick\u00ad\nness or diameter, a deduction of 0.25% from the percentage \nof elongation in 8 in. [200 mm] specified in Table 1 shall \nbe made for each increase of \u00bd 2 in. [0.8 mm] in the specified \nthickness or diameter above\u00be in. [19 mm]. \n7.1.1.4 For material under 1fo in. [8 mm] in thick\u00ad\nness or diameter, a deduction of 2.00% from the percentage \nof elongation in 8 in. [200 mm] specified in Table 1 shall be \nmade for each decrease of \u00bd 2 in. [0.8 mm] in the specified \nthickness or diameter below 3/i 6 in. [8 mm]. \n7.1.1.5 For Grades 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 [310, \n345, 380, and 415) for material over 2 in. [50 mm] in \nthickness or diameter, a deduction of 1.00% from the per\u00ad\ncentage of elongation in 2 in. [50 mm] specified in Table 1 \nshall be made for each 1 in. [25 mm] of specified thickness \nor diameter or fraction thereof over 2 in. [50 mm] in \nthickness or diameter. \n7.1.1.6 For Grades 70, 75, 80, and 90 [485, 515, \n550 and 620] for material over 2 in. [50 mm] in thickness \nor diameter, a deduction of 1.00% from the percentage of \nelongation in 2 in. [50 mm] specified in Table 1 shall be \nmade for each 1 in. [25 mm] of specified thickness or \ndiameter, or fraction thereof, over 2 in. [50 mm] in diameter \nor thickness, to a maximum deduction of 3%. \n7.1.2 Test Specimens: \n7.1.2.1 Test specimens shall be prepared for test\u00ad\ning from the material in its as-rolled condition unless other\u00ad\nwise specified (see Supplementary Requirements). The \ntension specimen may be aged as described in Test Meth\u00ad\nods and Definitions A 370. \n7.1.2.2 Test specimens shall be taken longitudi\u00ad\nnally and may be tested in full thickness or section, or they \nmay be machined to the dimensions shown in Fig. 4 or \nFig. 5 of Test Methods and Definitions A 370. If test speci\u00ad\nmens are selected conforming to the dimensions of Fig. 5, \nthey shall be machined from a position midway between \nthe center and the surface of the bar. \n7.1.2.3 Test specimens for shapes and flats may \nbe machined to the form and dimensions shown in Fig. 4 \nof Test Methods and Definitions A 370 or with both edges \nparallel. Test specimens for material over 1\u00bd in. [40 mm] \n1115 ",
