Repair \n8.1 Castings shall not be repaired by plugging, welding, \nbrazing, impregnation, or any other means. \n9. Sampling \n9.1 Test coupons will be obtained from the casting. The \nlocation in the casting from which the test coupons are \nobtained and the number obtained from each location shall be \nagreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. \n9.2 Metallographic samples shall be obtained from the same \nlocation as the mechanical test coupons. \n9.3 Nondestructive examination methods for estimating mi\u00ad\ncrostructure may be used to supplement the destructive exami\u00ad\nnation sampling plan. \n9.4 Sampling for chemical analysis shall be in accordance \nwith Practice E 59. \n9 .4 .1 The chemical analysis for total. carbon shall be made \non either chilled cast pencil-type specimens or thin wafers \napproximately 1/32 in. [0.8 mm] thick cut from test coupons. \n10. Number of Tests and Retests \n10.1 The number of tension tests and the number of micro\u00ad\nstructural examinations shall be agreed upon between the \nmanufacturer and purchaser. \n10.2 If any tension test specimen shows obvious defects, it \nmay be discarded and another from the same coupon may be \ntested. \n11. Test Methods \nn .1 Conduct the tension test in accordance with Test \nMethods E 8. \n11.2 Detemune the yield strength using one of the following \nmethods: \n11.2.1 The 0.2 % offset method, or \n11.2.2 Extension under load method where the yield \nstrength may be determined as the stress producing an elonga\u00ad\ntion under load of 0.330 %, that is, 0.0066 in. [0.165 mm] in a \ngage length of 2 in. [50 mm]. \n11.3 Determine the percent of each graphite nodule type by \nmanual coating, semi-automatic, or automatic image analysis \nmethods. The manual count method shall prevail when the \nresults of other methods differ. Magnification shall be at 100 X. \n11.4 Spectrometric methods may be used for chemical \nanalysis. Should a dispute arise concerning chemical compo\u00ad\nsition, use Test Methods E 351 and E 30 for referee methods. \n12. Records \n12.1 Records of the chemical composition, mechanical \nproperties, and the metallographic examination shall be sys\u00ad\ntematically made and maintained. \n13. Inspection \n13.1 Unless otherwise specified in the contract or purchase \norder, the manufacturer shall perform all of the tests and \ninspections required by the specification. \n13.2 AH tests and inspections shall be made at the place of \nmanufactLu-e or a mutually agreed upon location. \n13.3 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have \nentry at all times, while work on the contract of the purchaser \nis being performed, to all parts of the manufacturer's works \nthat concern the manufacture of the material ordered. The \nmanufacturer shall afford the inspector all reasonable facilities \nto satisfy that the material is being furnished in accordance \nwith these specifications. The inspector representing the pur\u00ad\nchaser shall not interfere unnecessarily with the operation of \nthe works. \n14. Certification \n14.1 The manufacturer's certification shall be furnished to \nthe purchaser stating the material was manufactured, sampled, \ntested, and inspected in accordance with this specification \n(including the year of issue) and was found to meet the \nrequirement(s). In addition, a test report shall be included with \nthe certification giving the results of all tests performed \nincluding chemical analysis. \n15. Product Marking \n15.l The casting shall be identified and shall be marked in \naccordance with instructions issued by the purchaser. \n1373 ",
