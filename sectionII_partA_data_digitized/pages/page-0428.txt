NoTE 1-When necessary, it is permissible to use a murower specimen, 
but in such a case the reduced po1tion shall be not less than I in. in width. 
NoTE 2-Punch marks for measuring elongation after fracture shall be 
made on the flat or on the edge of the specimen and within the parallel 
section; either a set of nine punch marks 1 in. apart, or one or more sets 
of 8-in. punch marks may be used. 
NoTE 3-The dimension t is the thickness of the test specimen as 
provided for in the applicable material specifications.

angle of 180° to the bend diameters provided for in either 
Specification A6/ A6M or Specification A20/ A20M, Appendix 
X4 or equivalent, as applicable. At least two of the three tests 
shall show not more than 50 % separation on both edges of the 
bent portion. Greater separation shall be cause for rejection. 
7.3 Methods and practices relating to mechanical testing 
required by this specification shall be in accordance with the 
Test Methods and Definitions of A370. 
8. Number of Tests and Retests 
8.1 One or more tension tests, as required by the specifica­
tions for the base metal and, when specified, one shear test or 
three bond bend tests shall be made representing each plate as 
rolled. Each specimen shall be in the final condition of heat 
treatment required for the plate, including any SPWHT if 
required. 
8.2 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws, it may be discarded and another specimen 
substituted. 
9. Test Specimens 
9.1 The tension test specimens from plate shall conform to 
the requirements prescribed in the specifications for the base 
metal. 
9.2 Bend test specimens for the alternative bond strength 
tests shall be taken at right angles to longitudinal axis of the 
plate. 
9.3 When required by the purchaser, the shear test specimen 
should be taken near a corner of the plate, parallel to its 
longitudinal axis, or other location that is representative of the 
final product. 
9.4 For plates 1 ½ in. (38 mm) and under in thickness 
tension test specimens shall be full thickness of the material 
except as specified in 7.1.2 and 7.1.3. 
9.5 For plates over 1 ½ in. (38 mm) in thickness, tension 
tests shall be of the form shown in Fig. 3 and shall be of all 
base steel conforming to the requirements of the specification 
for the base steel.

9.6 The bend test specimen used for bond strength determi­
nation shall be 1½ in. (38 mm) wide by not more than¾ in. 
(19 mm) in thickness and shall be machined to the form and 
dimensions shown in Fig. 2, or may be machined with both

NoTE I-The gage length and fillets shall be as shown, but the ends 
may be of any shape to fit the holders of the testing machine in such a way 
that the load shall be axial. The reduced section shall have a gradual taper 
from the ends toward the center, with the ends 0.003 to 0.005 in. larger in 
diameter than the center.
