2.3 SAE Standard: 
J429 Mechanical and Material Requirements For Externally 
Threaded Fasteners 
3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for externally threaded fasteners (including nuts 
and accessories) under this specification shall include the 
following: 
3.1.1 ASTM designation and year of issue, 
3.1.2 Name of product, bolts or studs; and bolt head style, 
that is, hex or heavy hex, 
3.1.3 Grade, that is, A, or·B. If no grade is specified, Grade 
A is furnished. 
3.1.4 Quantities (number of pieces by size including nuts), 
3 .1.5 Fastener size and length, 
3.1.6 Washers-Quantity and size (separate from bolts), 
3.1.7 Zinc Coating-Specify the zinc-coating process re-
quired, for example, hot-dip, mechanically deposited, or no 
preference (see 4.5). 
3.1.8 Other Finishes-Specify other protective finish, if 
required. 
3.1.9 Specify if inspection at point of manufacture is re­
quired, 
3.1.10 Specify if certified test report is required (see 8.2), 
and 
3.1.11 Specify additional testing (8.3) or special require­
ments. 
3.1.12 For establishment of a pait identifying system, see 
ASME Bl8.24. 
4. Materials and Manufacture 
4.1 Steel for bolts and studs shall be made by the open­
hearth, basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace process. 
4.2 Bolts shall be produced by hot or cold forging of the 
heads or machining from bar stock. 
4.3 Heat Treatment: 
4.3.1 Cold headed fasteners with head configurations other 
than hex having a minimum head height less than or equal to 
.5 D (D is nominal diameter) shall be stress relief annealed at 
a minimum temperature of 875°F. 
4.3.2 Stress relieving of hex head fasteners and those with 
minimum head heights greater than .5 D shall be at the 
manufacturer's option. 
4.4 Bolt and stud threads shall be rolled or cut. 
4.5 Zinc Coatings, Hot-Dip and Mechanically Deposited: 
4.5.1 When zinc-coated fasteners are required, the pur-
chaser shall specify the zinc-coating process, for example hot 
dip, mechanically deposited, or no preference. 
4.5.2 When hot-dip is specified, the fasteners shall be 
zinc-coated by the hot-dip process in accordance with the 
requirements of Specification F2329. 
4.5.3 When mechanically deposited is specified, the fasten­
ers shall be zinc-coated by the mechanical-deposition process 
in accordance with the requirements of Class 55 of Specifica­
tion B695. 
4.5.4 When no preference is specified, the supplier may 
furnish either a hot-dip zinc coating in accordance with 
Specification F2329, or a mechanically deposited zinc coating 
in accordance with Specification B695, Class 55. Threaded 
components (bolts and nuts) shall be coated by the same 
zinc-coating process and the supplier's option is limited to one 
process per item with no mixed processes in a lot. 
5. Chemical Composition 
5 .1 Grade A and B bolts and studs shall have a heat analysis 
conforming to the requirements specified in Table 1 based on 
the steel producer's heat analysis. 
5.2 The purchaser shall have the option of conducting 
product analyses on finished bolts in each lot, which shall 
conform to the product analysis specified in Table l. 
5.3 In case of conflict or for referee purposes, the product 
analysis shall take precedence. 
5.4 Bolts and studs are customarily furnished from stock, in 
which case individual heats of steel cannot be identified. 
5.5 Application of heats of steel to which bismuth, sele­
nium, tellurium, or lead has been intentionally added shall not 
be permitted for Grade B bolts and studs. 
5.6 Chemical analyses shall be performed in accordance 
with Test Methods, Practices, and Terminology A751. 
6. Mechanical Properties 
6.1 Grades A and B bolts and studs shall conform to the 
hardness specified in Table 2. 
6.2 Grade A and B bolts and studs 1 ½ in. in diameter or less, 
other than those excepted in 6.4, shall be tested full size and 
shall conform to the requirements for tensile strength specified 
in Table 3. 
441 
6.3 Grade A and B bolts and studs larger than 1 ½ in. in 
diameter, other than those excepted in 6.4, shall preferably be 
tested full size and when equipment of sufficient capacity is 
available and shall conform to the requirements for tensile 
strength specified in Table 3. When equipment of sufficient 
capacity for full-size bolt testing is not available, or when the 
length of the bolt makes full-size testing impractical, machined 
specimens shall be tested and shall conform to the require­
ments specified in Table 4.
