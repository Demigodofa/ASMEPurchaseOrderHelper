A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. \nA superscript epsilon(,:) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval. \n1. Scope* \n1. 1 This specification 2 covers seamless and straight-seam \nwelded ferritic/austenitic steel pipe intended for general corro\u00ad\nsive service, with particular emphasis on resistance to stress \ncorrosion cracking. These steels are susceptible to embrittle\u00ad\nment if used for prolonged periods at elevated temperatures. \n1.2 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for \npipe when a greater degree of testing is desired. These \nsupplementary requirements call for additional tests to be made \nand, when desired, one or more of these may be specified in the \norder. \n1.3 Appendix Xl of this specification lists the dimensions of \nwelded and seamless stainless steel pipe as shown in ANSI \nB36.19. Pipe having other dimensions may be furnished \nprovided such pipe complies with all other requirements of this \nspecification. \n1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units \nare to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the \nSI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each \nsystem may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each system \nshall be used independently of the other. Combining values \nfrom the two systems may result in non-conformance with the \nstandard. The inch-pound units shall apply unless the M \ndesignation of this specification is specified in the order. \nNorn 1-The dimensionless designator NPS (nominal pipe size) has \nbeen substituted in this standard for such traditional terms as nominal \ndiameter, size, and nominal size. \n1.5 This international standard was developed in accor\u00ad\ndance with internationally recognized principles on standard\u00ad\nization established in the Decision on Principles for the \nDevelopment of International Standards, Guides and Recom\u00ad\nmendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical \nBarriers to Trade (TBT) Committee. \n1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee AO! on Steel, \nStainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee \nAOl.10 on Stainless and Alloy Steel Tubular Products. \nCurrent edition approved March I, 2024. Published March 2024. Originally \napproved in I 981. Last previous edition approved in 2023 as A 790/ A 790M - 23. \nDOI: 10.1520/A0790_A0790M-24. \n2 For ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code applications see related Specifi\u00ad\ncation SA-790 in Section II of that Code. \n2.
