When \"Tensile Properties Required\" is \nspecified in the purchase order, round tubing shall conform to \nthe tensile requirements and not necessarily the hardness limits \nshown in Table S5.1. For grades of round tubing not shown in \n861 \nTable S5.l, and for all square and rectangular tubing, tensile or \nhardness limits shall be upon agreement between the manufac\u00ad\nturer and the purchaser. \nS5.2 Number of tests and retests shall be as follows: one \ntension test per lot shall be made (See Note Sl) and 1 % of all \ntubes per lot but in no case less than 5 tubes shall be tested for \nhardness. If the results of the mechanical tests do not conform \nto the requirements shown in the table, retests shall be made on \nadditional tubes double the original number selected, each of \nwhich shall conform to the specified requirements. \nNoTE S 1-A lot shall consist of all tubes, before cutting to length, of the \nsame size and wall thickness which are produced from the same heat of ",
