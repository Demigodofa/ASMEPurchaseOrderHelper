The chemical composition thus deter\u00ad\nmined shall conform to the requirements specified. \n7.2.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of \ntwo additional billets or tubes shall be made. Both retests, for \nthe elements in question, shall meet the requirements of the \nspecification; otherwise all remaining material in the heat shall \nbe rejected or, at the option of the producer, each billet or tube \nmay be individually tested for acceptance. Billets or tubes that \ndo not meet the requirements of the specification shall be \nrejected. \n8. Grain Size \n8.1 Grain size shall be as given in Table 3, as determined in \naccordance with Test Methods E112. \n8.2 Grain size determinations, to demonstrate compliance \nwith 8.1, shall be made on one end of one finished tube from \neach lot. See 15.1. \n9. Mechanical Properties \n9.1 Tensile Requirements: \n9.1.1 The material shall conform to the requirements as to \ntensile properties given in Table 4. \n9.1.2 Table 5 gives the computed minimum elongation \nvalues for each V32-in. [0.8-mm] decrease in wall thickness. \nWhere the wall thickness lies between two values shown in \nTable 5, the minimum elongation value shall be determined by \nthe following equations. For Grades T23, T24, T91, T92, T115, \nT122, Tl28, T911, T921, and S44400: E = 32t + 10.00 [E = \n1.25t + 10.00]. For Grade T36: E = 32t + 5.0 [E = 1.25t + 5.0]. \nFor grade T93: E = 32t + 9.00 [E = l.25t + 9.00]. For all other \nferritic alloy grades: E = 48t + 15.00 [E = l.87t + 15.00]. \nwhere: \nE = elongation in 2 in. [50 mm], %, and \nt = actual thickness of specimen, in. [mm]. \n9 .1.3 One tension test shall be made on a specimen from one \ntube for lots of not more than 50 tubes. Tension tests shall be \nmade on specimens from two tubes for lots of more than 50 \ntubes. See 15.2. \n9.2 Hardness Requirements: \n9 .2.1 The material shall conform to the hardness require\u00ad\nments given in Table 4. See 15.2. \n9.2.2 Brinell, Vickers, or Rockwell hardness tests shall be \nmade on specimens from two tubes from each lot. See 15.2. \n9 .3 Flattening Test-One flattening test shall be made on \nspecimens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used \nfor the flaring test, from each lot. See 15.1. \n9.4 Flaring Test-One flaring test shall be made on speci\u00ad\nmens from each end of one finished tube, not the one used for \nthe flattening test, from each lot. See 15.1. \n9.5 Mechanical property requirements do not apply to \ntubing smaller than Vs in. [3.2 mm] in inside diameter or \nthinner than 0.015 in. [0.4 mm] in thickness. \n10. Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test \n10.1 Each tube shall be subjected to the nondestructive \nelectric test or the hydrostatic test. The type of test to be used \nshall be at the option of the manufacturer, unless otherwise \nspecified in the purchase order. \n11. Forming Operations \n11.1 Tubes, when inserted in a boiler or tube sheet, shall \nstand expanding and beading without showing cracks or flaws. \nSuperheater tubes when properly manipulated shall stand all \nforging, welding, and bending operations necessary for appli\u00ad\ncation without developing defects. See Note 1. \nNOTE I-Certain of the ferritic steels covered by this specification will \nharden if cooled rapidly from above their critical temperature. Some will \nair harden, that is, become hardened to an undesirable degree when cooled \nin air from high temperatures, particularly chromium-containing steels \nwith chromium of 4 % and higher. Therefore, operations that involve \nheating such steels above their critical temperatures, such as welding, \nflanging, and hot bending, should be followed by suitable heat treatment. \n12. Repair by Welding \n12.1 Repair welding shall be performed in conformance . \nwith Specification A1016/A1016M. \n12.2 All repair welds in T91 shall be made with one of the \nfollowing welding processes and consumables: SMAW, A5.5/ \nA5.5M E90XX-B9; SAW, A5.23/A5.23M EB9 + neutral flux; \nGTAW, A5.28/A5.28M ER90S-B9; and FCAW A5.29/A5.29M \nE91Tl-B9. In addition, the sum of the Ni+Mn content of all \nwelding consumables used to weld repair T91 Types 1 and 2 \nshall not exceed 1.0 %. \n12.3 All repair welds in T92, T93, T911, and T122, shall be \nmade using welding consumables meeting the chemical re\u00ad\nquirements for the grade in Table 1. \n13. Permissible Variations from the Specified Wall \nThickness \n13.1 Permissible variations from the specified minimum \nwall thickness shall be in accordance with Specification \nA1016/A1016M. \n13.2 Permissible variations from the specified average wall \nthickness shall be \u00b1 10 % of the specified average wall \nthickness for cold formed tubes and, unless otherwise specified \nby the purchaser, shall be in accordance with Table 6 for hot \nformed tubes. \n287 \n14. Surface Condition \n14.1 Ferritic alloy cold-finished steel tubes shall be free of \nscale and suitable for inspection. A slight amount of oxidation \nis not considered scale. \n14.2 Ferritic alloy hot-finished steel tubes shall be free of \nloose scale and suitable. for inspection. \u2022 \n14.3 Stainless steel tubes shall be pickled free of scale. \nWhen bright annealing is used, pickling is not necessary. \n14.4 Any special finish requirement shall be subject to \nagreement between the supplier and the purchaser. \n15. Sampling \n15.1 For flattening, flaring, and grain size\u00b7requirements, the \nterm lot applies to all tubes, prior to cutting, of the same size\u00b7 \n(see 4.1.7) that are produced from the same heat of steel.When ",
