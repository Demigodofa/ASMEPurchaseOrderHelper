Manufacture \n4.1 Steelmaking Practice-The steel shall be killed and \nshall conform to the fine austenitic grain size requirement of \nSpecification A20/ A20M. \n4.2 The plates shall be produced by the thermo-mechanical \ncontrol process. \n5. Chemical Composition \n5.1 The chemical composition on heat analysis shall con\u00ad\nform to the requirements given in Table 1, except as otherwise \nprovided in Supplementary Requirement S 17 of Specification \nA20/ A20M when that requirement is involved. \n5.2 If a product analysis is made on a sample taken from the \nstandard location (see Specification A20/A20M), the results of \nthe analysis shall not deviate from the limits for the heat \nanalysis by more than the values given in Table 2. \n6. Mechanical Requirements \n6.1 If the plates are to be subjected to warm forming or \npost-weld heat treatment, the test coupons shall be subjected to \nheat treatment to simulate such fabrication operations. (See \n3.2.1 and Specification A20/ A20M, Supplementary Require\u00ad\nment S3.) \n6.2 Tension Test Requirements-The plates as represented \nby the tension-test specimens shall conform to the require\u00ad\nments given in Table 3. \n6.2.1 Number and Location of Test Coupons-Two tension \ntests shall be made from each plate-as-rolled. One test coupon \nshall be taken from a comer of the plate on each end. \n6.3 Notch Toughness Test Requirements: \n6.3.1 Except for Grade G, longitudinal Charpy V-notch tests \nshall be made in accordance with Specification A20/A20M. \n6.3.2 For Grades A, B and C, unless the test temperature and \nabsorbed energy requirements are specified in the purchase \norder, the tests shall be conducted at -40\u00b0F [-40\u00b0C] and the \naverage absorbed energy for each set of three full size \nspecimens shall be 15 ft-lb [20J] or more. \n6.3.3 For Grade D, unless the test temperature and the \nlateral expansion requirements are specified in the purchase \norder, the tests shall be conducted at -40\u00b0F [-40\u00b0C] and the \nlateral expansion for each specimen shall be 0.015 in. [0.4 mm] \nor more. \n6.3.4 For Grades E and F, unless the test temperature and \nabsorbed energy requirements are specified in the purchase \norder, the tests shall be conducted at -40\u00b0F [-40\u00b0C] and the \naverage absorbed energy for each set of three full size \nspecimens shall be 20 ft\u00b7lb [27 J] or more. \n6.3.5 For Grade G, transverse Charpy V-notch tests shall be \nmade in accordance with Specification A20/A20M. Unless the \ntest temperature is specified in the purchase order, the tests \nshall be conducted at -320\u00b0F [-195\u00b0C]. Each specimen shall \nhave a lateral expansion opposite the notch of not less than \n0.D15 in. [0.38 mm], up to a plate thickness of 1.25 in. [31.75 \nmm] inclusive; and 0.019 in. [0.48 mm] at a plate thickness of \n2.0 in. [50 mm]. Values of lateral expansion for plate thick\u00ad\nnesses between 1.25 in. [31.75 mm] and 2.0 in. [50 mm] shall \nbe determined by linear interpolation. \n7. Marking \n7 .1 In addition to the marking required in Specification \nA20/ A20M, each plate shall be legibly stamped with the letters \n\"TMC\" following the stamped specification designation. \n8. Keywords \n8.1 pressure containing parts; pressure vessel steel; steel \nplates; steel plates for pressure vessel applications \n1357 ",
