ENot more than one specimen from a set may be below this value. 
6.5 Orientation-For upset disk forgings, the longitudinal 
axis of all test specimens shall be oriented in the tangential or 
radial direction. For all other forgings, the longitudinal axis of 
the specimens shall be oriented in the direction of maximum 
working of the forging, or as agreed between manufacturer and 
purchaser. 
6.6 Number of Tests: 
6.6.1 For forgings weighing 1000 lb [455 kg] or less, as heat 
treated but not exceeding 80 in. [2030 mm] in length, exclud­
ing test material, one tension test and one set of impact tests 
(three specimens) shall be taken to represent each heat in each 
heat-treatment charge. This testing shall be repeated at the 
opposite end of the same test forging, if the heat-treated length 
excluding test material exceeds 80 in. [2030 mm]. When heat 
treatment is performed in continuous-type furnaces with suit­
able temperature control and equipped with recording pyrom­
eters so that complete heat-treatment records are available, a 
heat-treatment charge shall be considered as any continuous 
run not exceeding 8 h in duration. 
6.6.2 Forgings weighing over 1000 lb [455 kg] but not over 
5000 lb [2270 kg] as heat treated and not over 80 in. [2030 
mm] in length excluding test material, one tension test and one 
set of three impact tests shall be removed from each forging. 
When the length of the forging exceeds 80 in. [2030 mm] this 
testing shall be repeated at the opposite end of the forging. 
6.6.3 Forgings exceeding 5000 lb [2270 kg] and not over 80 
in. [2030 mm] in length, excluding test material, shall have one 
tension test and one set of three impact tests removed from 
each of two locations, 180° apart. For forgings with lengths 
exceeding 80 in. [2030 mm] this testing shall be repeated at the 
opposite end of the forging. Supplementary Requirement S6 is 
applicable for forgings intended for use under the rules of 
Section VIII, Division 3 of the ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code. 
7. Nondestructive Examination Requirements 
7.1 Ultrasonic Examination: 
7.1.1 Forgings shall be ultrasonically examined in accor­
dance with the procedures of Practice A388/A388M. 
7.1.1.1 Straight-Beam Examination: (a)Unless otherwise 
specified, the back-reflection method of tuning shall be used in 
accordance with Practice A388/A388M. 
(b) In addition to the reportable conditions of Practice 
A388/A388M, indications exceeding the resultant back­
reflection shall be recorded. 
(c) A forging shall be unacceptable when one or more 
reflections are present producing indications accompanied by a 
complete loss of back-reflection, not attributable to nor asso­
ciated with the geometric configuration. For this purpose, a 
back-reflection of less than 5 % of full screen height shall be 
considered complete loss of back-reflection. 
7.1.1.2 Angle-Beam Examination: (a) Calibration notches 
shall be cut into the inside diameter and outside diameter 
surfaces in accordance with Practice A388/A388M. 
(b) A forging that contains a discontinuity which results in an 
indication exceeding the amplitude of the reference line is 
subject to rejection. 
(c) The report of the ultrasonic test shall be in compliance 
with Practice A388/A388M. 
(d) Additional nondestructive examination or trepanning 
may be employed to resolve questions of interpretation of 
ultrasonic indications. The manufacturer shall accept respon­
sibility for injurious defects that will not be removed in final 
machining. 
7 .2 Magnetic Particle Examination: 
7 .2.1 Each forging shall be examined by magnetic particle 
methods described in Practice A275/A275M. Acceptance and 
rejection standards shall be as follows: Only indications with 
major dimensions greater than ½6 in. [1.6 mm] shall be 
considered relevant. The following relevant indications are 
unacceptable: 
7.2.1.1 Any linear indications greater than 1/16 in. [1.6 mm] 
long for materials less than 5/s in. [16 mm] thick; greater than 
1/s in. [3.2 mm] long for materials from 5/s in. to under 2 in. [50
