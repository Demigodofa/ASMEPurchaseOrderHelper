6. Chemical Composition 
6.1 Heat Analysis: 
6.1.1 A chemical heat analysis in accordance with Specifi­
cation A961/A961M shall be made and conform to the 
requirements as to chemical composition prescribed in Table 1. 
Leaded steels shall not be permitted. 
6.2 Product Analysis: 
6.2.1 The purchaser may make a product analysis on prod­
ucts supplied to this specification in accordance with Specifi­
cation A961/A961M. 
7. Mechanical Properties 
7.1 Tension Tests: 
7.1.1 Requirements-The material shall conform to require­
ments for tensile properties in Table 2. 
7 .1.1.1 The test specimen shall be obtained from a rough or 
finished forging, or prolongation thereof. For forgings under 
10 000 lbs, at time of heat treatment, it may be obtained from 
separately forged test blanks from the same heat of steel as the 
production forgings. The test blank shall be reduced by forging 
in a manner similar to that for the products represented, and 
shall receive approximately the same hot working and reduc­
tion and the same heat treatment as the finished products 
represented. The test material shall be treated in the same 
furnace at the same time as the forging it represents, subject to 
the requirements of 7 .1.2.1. 
7 .1.1.2 The test specimen shall represent all forgings from 
the same heat and heat-treatment load whose maximum thick­
nesses do not exceed the thickness of the test forging or blank 
by more than ¼ in. [6 mm]. 
7 .1.2 Number of Tests-One tension test at room tempera­
ture shall be made in accordance with 7 .1.1.2 from each heat in 
each heat-treatment load. 
7 .1.2.1 If heat treatment is performed in either a continuous 
or a batch-type furnace controlled within ±25 °F [±14 °C] of 
the required heat-treatment temperature and equipped with 
recording pyrometers so that complete records of heat treat­
ment are available and if the same heat-treating cycles are used 
on the forgings represented by the tension test, then one tension 
test from each heat shall be required, instead of one tension test 
from each heat in each heat treatment load in accordance with 
7.1.1.2. 
7 .1.3 Test Locations and Orientations-The test specimen 
shall be removed from the heaviest section of the forging or 
test blank, at locations described in 7.1.3.1, 7.1.3.2, 7.1.3.5 or 
as close to these locations as practical, subject to forging size 
and geometry. 
7.1.3.1 For forgings or test blanks having a maximum 
heat-treated thickness, T, of 2 in. [50 mm] or less, the 
longitudinal axis of the test specimen shall be taken at 
mid-thickness and its mid-length shall be at least 2 in. [50 mm] 
from all other heat treated surfaces, exclusive of the T 
dimension surfaces. (This is normally referred to as V2 T by 2 
in. [50 mm]). See Fig. 1 for test specimen location in separately 
forged test blanks. 
7.1.3.2 For forgings or test blanks having a maximum 
heat-treated thickness, T, greater than 2 in. [50 mm]:
