SA-962/SA-962M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
S58.4 All bolting that are not of the correct material grade 
shall be rejected. 
S58.5 The method of bolting marking after examination 
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. 
S59. Pressure Equipment Directive-Mechanical Testing 
S59.1 Charpy impact testing shall be done at the lowest 
scheduled operating temperature, but not higher than 20 °C [68 
OF]. 
S59 .2 The frequency of impact testing shall be the same as 
that specified in the product specification for the tension test, 
with three individual Charpy test specimens for each required 
tension test. 
S59.3 The minimum individual energy for the Charpy 
impact test shall be 20 ft-lb [27 J]. 
S59.4 The minimum elongation in the tension test shall be 
measured on a gauge length of five times the diameter of the 
test specimen, and shall not be less than 14 %. 
S59.5 Impact and tension test results shall be included in the 
product certification. 
S60. Heat Treat Charts 
S60.1 The supplier shall provide heat treat charts as a part of 
the order documentation. 
S61. Hardness Testing 
S61.l Each piece of bolting shall be hardness tested and 
found to meet the requirements of the product specification or 
this standard, as applicable. A minimum sample consisting of 
10 % of the pieces in each lot shall be tested using an 
indentation method in accordance with Test Methods and 
Definitions A370 when inch-pound units are specified or to the 
applicable track of Test Methods A1058 if SI units are 
specified. Each piece in the sample shall meet the hardness 
requirements. The balance of the lot may be tested using either 
the indentation method per Test Methods and Definitions A370 
when inch-pound units are specified or to the applicable track 
of Test Methods A1058 if SI units are specified or electromag­
netic sorting in accordance with Practice E566. If any piece in 
the sample is outside of the specified hardness requirements, 
then the lot shall be rejected and either reprocessed and 
resampled, or tested 100 % by indentation hardness methods. 
S62. Ultrasonic Examination of Bolting in Sizes Greater 
than 2 in. [50 mm] in Cross Section 
S62.1 All bolting with a major cross section greater than 2 in. 
[50 mm] shall be subjected to ultrasonic inspection (UT) prior 
to threading. 
S62.2 Ultrasonic inspection shall be carried out using 
L-wave transducers in the radial direction. 
S62.3 Search units shall not exceed 1 in.2 [645 mm 2 ] in area 
and shall have a nominal frequency of 2 or 2¼ MHz. 
S62.4 Inspection sensitivity shall be established using a first 
back reflection set at 80 % of full screen height (FSH). 
S62.5 Indications whose amplitude exceeds 20 % FSH and 
those which cause the back reflection signal amplitude to 
decrease to 40 % or less FSH are not acceptable. 
S63. Phosphorus and Sulfur Maximums 
S63.1 The phosphorus and sulfur content of carbon and low 
alloy steels shall be 0.025 % max. 
S64. Product Inspection 
S64. l Sampling for dimensional, thread fit and visual 
inspection of product shall be performed in accordance with 
ASME B18.18 Category 2. 
S65. Product Inspection 
S65.l Sampling for dimensional, thread fit and visual 
inspection of product shall be performed in accordance with 
ASME Bl8.18 Category 3. 
S66. Marking for Lot Traceability 
S66.1 In addition to the requirements stated in Section 20, 
bolting components (purchaser to designate whether bolts or 
nuts or other specific items apply) shall be individually hard 
marked with a traceability code that provides full traceability to 
the lot, with a lot as defined in 3.1.10 for fasteners. The 
traceability code shall be defined by the bolting manufacturer 
and shall be reported on the certification. 
S67. Eddy Current Inspection 
S67 .1 Eddy current examination shall be applied to 100 % of 
the lot in accordance with a defined practice approved by the 
purchaser. Reject levels for linear indications shall be based on 
the alarm response from a surface notch with a maximum depth 
of 0.012 in. [0.030 mm] in a calibration bar. 
S68. Ultrasonic Inspection 
S68.l Ultrasonic examination shall be applied to 100 % of 
the lot in accordance with a defined practice approved by the 
purchaser. Reject levels for linear indications shall be based on 
the alarm response from a surface notch with a maximum depth 
of 0.012 in. [0.030 mm] in a calibration bar. 
S69. Sampling For Hardness Testing 
S69.1 Finished components or blanks from each heat treat­
ment charge shall be subjected to hardness testing. The number 
of samples tested shall meet the requirements of Guide F1470, 
Table 3, Sample Size B. 
S70. Maximum Hardness for Carbon and Alloy Steel 
S70.1 The maximum hardness of components shall not 
exceed 32 HRC [302 HBW]. 
S71. Passivation of Stainless Steel Bolting 
S71.1 Stainless Steel Bolting components shall be passivated 
in accordance with Practice A380/A380M or Specification 
A967 / A967M at the option of the manufacturer or shall be 
electropolished.
