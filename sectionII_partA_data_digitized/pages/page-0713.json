However, reference \nmarks for measurement of elongation should nevertheless be spaced at the indicated gage length. \n(3) The gage length and fillets shall be as shown, but the ends may be of any form to fit the holders of the testing machine in such a way that \nthe load shall be axial. If the ends are to be held in grips it is desirable, to make the length of the grip section great enough to allow the \nspecimen to extend into the grips a distance equal to two thirds or more of the length of the grips. \nFIG. 7 TEST COUPONS FOR MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF DUCTILE IRON \n663 \n[44mm] \n3/ain. \n[10 mm] \n1 r \n[70mm] \nSection A-A \nE \nE \nN \n~ \nC E \n~ E \nr--N :e.
