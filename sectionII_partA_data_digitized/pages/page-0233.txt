2.3 American National Standards Institute Standard: 
B 16.25 Buttwelding Ends 
B 36.10 Welded and Seamless Wrought Steel Pipe 
3. Ordering Information 
3.1 Orders for electric-fusion arc-welded pipe under this 
specification shall contain information concerning as many of 
the following items as are required, to describe the desired pipe 
adequately: 
3.1.1 Quantity (feet, metres, or number of lengths), 
3.1.2 Name of material (electric-fusion (arc)-welded pipe), 
3.1.3 ASTM Specification A134 or A134M and year date, 
3.1.4 Grade (if applicable) of steel from which the pipe shall 
be made (Section 4), 
3.1.5 Size (inside or outside diameter and nominal wall 
thickness), and 
3.1.6 Length (specified or random). 
3.2 The purchaser shall have the option to order additional 
requirements, including, but not limited to the following: 
3.2.1 Specific straightness requirements (see 12.3), 
3.2.2 End finish (Section 14), 
3.2.3 Hydrostatic Test Pressure (Section 11), 
3.2.4 Protective coating (Section 20), 
3.2.5 End use of pipe, and 
3.2.6 Other special or supplementary requirements, if any. 
4. Material 
4.1 The steel from which the pipe is made shall conform to 
Specifications A36/A36M, A283/A283M, A285/A285M, 
AlOll/AlOllM, A1018/A1018M, or to other ASTM specifi­
cations for equally suitable weldable material, as specified. For 
purposes of marking and certification, when required, the pipe 
grade of material shall be established by the A xxx plate 
specification designation and plate grade, when applicable. 
5. Manufacture 
5.1 The longitudinal edges of the steel shall be shaped to 
give the most satisfactory results by the particular welding 
process employed. The steel shall then be properly formed and 
may be tacked preparatory to welding. The weld shall be made 
by automatic means (except tack welds) and shall be of 
reasonably uniform width and height for the entire length of the 
pipe. By agreement between the purchaser and the 
manufacturer, manual welding by qualified procedure and 
welders may be used as an equal alternate under this specifi­
cation. 
5.2 All longitudinal seams, spiral seams, and shop girth 
seams shall be butt-welded. 
6. Number of Production Weld Tests 
6.1 One weld test specimen specified in Section 8 shall be 
made from each lot of 3000 ft [900 m] of pipe or fraction 
thereof of each size and wall thickness. 
6.2 If any test specimen shows defective machining or 
develops flaws not associated with the welding, it may be 
discarded and another specimen substituted. 
6.3 Each length of pipe shall be subjected to the hydrostatic 
test specified in Section 11, unless otherwise specified in 11.3. 
7. Retests 
7.1 If any specimen tested in accordance with Section 10 
fails to meet the requirements, retests of two additional 
specimens from the same lot of pipe shall be made, each of 
which shall meet the requirements specified. If any of the 
retests fail to conform to the requirements, test specimens may 
be taken from each untested pipe length at the manufacturer's 
option. Each specimen shall meet the requirements specified, 
or that pipe shall be rejected. 
8. Test Specimens of Production Welds 
8.1 The weld-test specimens for the reduced-section tension 
test shall be taken perpendicularly across the weld and from the 
end of the pipe or, alternatively, from flat test pieces of material 
conforming to the requirements in the specifications used in the 
manufacture of the pipe. The alternative weld-test specimens 
shall be welded with the same procedure and by the same 
operator and equipment, and in sequence with the welding of 
the longitudinal joints in the pipe. The test pieces shall have the 
weld approximately in the middle of the specimen. The 
specimens shall be straightened cold, and shall be tested at 
room temperature. 
8.2 Reduced-section tension-test specimens shall be pre­
pared in accordance with Fig. A2.3 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370, Annex A2 Steel Tubular Products. 
9. Qualification of Welding Procedure 
9.1 The welding procedure shall be qualified in accordance 
with the American Welding Society Standard Qualification 
Procedure 5 or ASME Section IX of the Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code as agreed to between the manufacturer and the 
purchaser using the tests and test values specified in 9.2 and 
9.3. Thicknesses less than 3/s in. [10 mm] shall be qualified for 
each wall thickness of pipe manufactured. Thicknesses 3/s to ¾ • 
in. [10 mm to 19 mm], inclusive, shall be qualified in 3/s-in. 
[10-mm] thickness. 
181 
9.2 Two reduced-section tension specimens (transverse 
weld) made in accordance with Fig. A2.3 of Test Methods and 
Definitions A370, with the weld reinforcement removed, shall 
show a tensile strength not less than 100 % of the minimum 
specified tensile strength of the base material used. 
9.3 Two face-bend test specimens shall be prepared in 
accordance with Section A2.5.l.7 of Test Methods and Defi­
nitions A370 and shall withstand being bent 180° in a jig 
substantially in accordance with Fig. A2.15.3 of Test Methods 
and Definitions A370. The bend test shall be acceptable if no 
cracks·or other defects exceeding 1/s in. [3 mm] in any direction 
be present in the weld metal or between the weld and the pipe
