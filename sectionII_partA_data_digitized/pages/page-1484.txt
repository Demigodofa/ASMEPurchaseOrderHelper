SA-965/SA-965M ASME BPVC.II.A-2025 
Specification for 
Steel Forgings, Austenitic, for Pressure and High 
Temperature Parts 
1. Scope 
1.1 This specification covers austenitic stainless steel forg­
ings for boilers, pressure vessels, high temperature parts, and 
associated equipment. 
1.2 Supplementary requirements are provided for use when 
additional testing, inspection, or processing is required. In 
addition, supplementary requirements from Specification 
A788/A788M may be specified when appropriate. 
1.3 This specification includes the austenitic steel forgings 
that were a part of Specification A336/A336M. 
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units 
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in 
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to 
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be 
used independently of the other, and values from the two 
systems shall not be combined. 
1.5 Unless the order specifies the applicable "M" specifica­
tion designation, the material shall be furnished to the inch­
pound units. 
1.6 This standard does not purport to address all of the 
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the 
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro­
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter­
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use. 
1.7 This international standard was developed in accor­
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard­
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the 
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom­
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical 
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
