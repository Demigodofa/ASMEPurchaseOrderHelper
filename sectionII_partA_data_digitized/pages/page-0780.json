Scope \n1.1 This specification covers quenched and tempered steel \nhex cap screws, bolts, and studs having a minimum tensile \nstrength of 120 ksi for diameters 1.0 in. and smaller; 105 ksi for \ndiameters over 1.0 in. to 1 \u00bd in.; and 90 ksi for diameters 1 \u00be \nin. to 3.0 in. inclusive. The term \"fasteners\" in this specification \ndenotes hex cap screws, bolts, and studs. \n1.2 The fasteners are intended for general engineering use. \n1.3 The fasteners are furnished in diameters \u00bc to 3.0 in. \ninclusive. They are designated by type denoting chemical \ncomposition as follows: \nType \nType I \nType 2 \nType 3 \nDescription \nPlain carbon steel, carbon boron steel, alloy \nsteel, or alloy boron steel \nWithdrawn 2003 \nWeathering steel \n1.4 Terms used in this specification are defined in Termi\u00ad\nnology Fl 789 unless otherwise defined in this specification. \n1.5 The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded \nas the standard. The values given in parentheses are provided \nfor information purposes only. \n1.6 This standard does not purport to address all of the \nsafety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the \nresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro\u00ad\npriate safety and health practices and determine the applica\u00ad\nbility of regulatory limitations prior to use. \n730 \n2.
