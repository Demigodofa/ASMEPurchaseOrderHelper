HARDNESS PROPERTIES \nX3.1 Table X3. l lists the typical hardness values. \nTABLE X3.1 Typical Hardness Values \nNorn 1-The hardness values shown are at the time of shipment. \nNorn 2-Tests for hardness shall be conducted in accordance with the \nrequirements of Test Methods EIS. \nNorn 3-The hardness values are Rockwell B scale as measured or \nconverted from the appropriate Rockwell scales. \nNorn 4-The typical hardness values apply to the full range of steel \u2022 \nsheet thickness. Hardness tends to increase as the steel sheet thickness \ndecreases. \nNorn 5-Hardness testing is commonly nsed to assess the relative \nfmmability of various designations of uncoated steel sheet. This assess\u00ad\nment done by many users is recognized to be only an approximation of the \nrelative formability and therefore cannot be used as a specification \nrequirement. \nDesignation \nCS Type A \nCS Type B \nCS Type C \nDS \nHardness-Rockwell B Scale \n75 or less \n75 or less \n75 or less \n65 or less \nSUMMARY OF CHANGES \nCommittee AO 1 has identified the location of selected changes to this standard since the last issue \n(AlOll/AlOllM- 18a) that may impact the use of this standard.
