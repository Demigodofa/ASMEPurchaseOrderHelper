Al.2.1 Carbon and alloy steel bars and bar-size shapes, due \nto their relatively small cross-sectional dimensions, are cus\u00ad\ntomaiily tested in the longitudinal direction. In special cases \nwhere size permits and the fab1ication or service of a part \njustifies testing in a transverse direction, the selection and \nlocation of test or tests are a matter of agreement between the \nmanufacturer and the purchaser. \nAl.3.3 When tension tests are specified, the practice for \nselecting test specimens for hot-rolled and cold-finished steel \nbars of vaiious sizes shall be in accordance with Table Al.I, \nunless otherwise specified in the product specification. \nAl.4 Bend Test \nAl.3 Tension Test \nAl.3.1 Carbon Steel Bars-Carbon steel bars are not com\u00ad\nmonly specified to tensile requirements in the as-rolled condi\u00ad\ntion for sizes of rounds, squares, hexagons, and octagons under \n\u00bd in. (13 mm) in diameter or distance between parallel faces \nnor for other bar-size sections, other than flats, less than 1 in.2 \n(645 mm 2 ) in cross-sectional area. \nAl.4.1 When bend tests are specified, the recommended \npractice for hot-rolled and cold-finished steel bars shall be in \naccordance with Table Al.2. \nAl.5 Hardness Test \nAl.5.1 Hardness Tests on Bar Products (flats, rounds, \nsquares, hexagons, and octagons) are conducted on the surface \nafter a minimum removal of 0.015 in. to provide for accurate \nTABLE A1.1 Practices for Selecting Tension Test Specimens for Steel Bar Products \nNam 1-For bar sections where it is difficult to determine the cross-sectional area by simple measurement, the area in square inches may be calculated \nby dividing the weight per linear inch of specimen in pounds by 0.2833 (weight of 1 in.3 of steel) or by dividing the weight per linear foot of specimen \nby 3.4 (weight of steel 1 in. sqnare and 1 ft long). \nThickness, in.
