3. Ordering Information 
3.1 See Specification A960/A960M. 
4. General Requirements 
4.1 Product furnished to this specification shall conform to 
the requirements of Specification A960/A960M, including any 
supplementary requirements that are indicated in the purchase 
order. Failure to comply with the general requirements of 
Specification A960/A960M constitutes non-conformance with 
this specification. In case of conflict between the requirements 
of this specification and Specification A960/ A960M, this 
specification shall prevail. 
5. Material 
5.1 The starting material for fittings shall be fully killed 
steel, consisting of forgings, bars, plates, sheet, and seamless or 
fusion welded tubular products with filler metal added and 
shall conform to the chemical requirements in Table 1. The 
steels shall be made using recognized melting practices neces­
sary to produce steels that shall meet the impact requirements 
of this specification. 
6. Manufacture 
6.1 Forging or forming operations shall be performed by 
hammering, pressing, piercing, extruding, upsetting, working, 
bending, fusion-welding, or machining, or by a combination of 
two or more of these operations. The forming procedure shall 
be so applied that it will not produce injurious defects in the 
fittings. 
6.2 All welds, including welds in tubular products from 
which fittings are made, shall be (1) made by welders, welding 
operators and welding procedures qualified under the provi­
sions of ASME Section IX, (2) heat treated in accordance with 
Section 7 of this specification, and (3) nondestructively exam­
ined throughout the entire length of each weld in accordance 
with Section 15 of this specification. The radiography of welds 
shall be done either prior to or after forming at option of 
manufacturer. Personnel performing NDE examinations shall 
be qualified in accordance with SNT-TC- lA. 
6.3 The welded joints of the fittings shall be finished in 
accordance with the requirements of Paragraph UW-35 (a) of 
Section VIII, Division 1 of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code. 
6.4 All butt-weld tees manufactured by cold-forming meth­
ods shall be liquid penetrant or magnetic particle examined by 
one of the methods specified in Supplementary Requirement 
S52 or S53 of Specification A960/A960M. This examination 
shall be performed after final heat treatment by NDE personnel 
qualified under the provisions of SNT-TC- lA. Only the side­
wall areas of the tee need be examined. This area is defined by 
a circle that covers the area from the weld bevel of the branch 
outlet to the centerline of the body or run. Internal and external 
surfaces shall be examined when size permits accessibility. 
After the removal of any cracks, the tees shall be re-examined 
by the original method. Acceptable tees shall be marked with 
the symbol PT or MT, as applicable, to indicate compliance. 
6.5 Stubends may be produced with the entire lap added by 
the welding of a ring, made from plate or bar of the same alloy 
grade and composition, to the outside of a straight section of 
pipe, provided the weld is double welded, is a full penetration 
joint, satisfies the requirements of 6.2 for qualifications and 
radiography and 7 .1 for post weld heat treatment.

7. Heat Treatment 
7.1 All fittings shall be furnished in the normalized, normal­
ized and tempered, annealed, or quenched and tempered 
condition. All welding shall be completed prior to the austen­
itizing heat treatment. 
7 .2 The full thickness of the material from which impact test 
specimens are to be obtained shall be heat treated with a 
furnace charge as specified in 10.4.2 or 10.4.3. 
7 .3 After forming, the fittings shall be allowed to cool below 
the lower critical before applying one of the heat treatments 
listed in 7.1. 
7.4 When specified in the order, the test specimens shall be 
subjected to a simulated post-weld heat treatment before 
testing. The simulated post-weld heat treatment used shall be
