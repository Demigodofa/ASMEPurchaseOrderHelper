,,,Half-Standard Flatness,,,,
NoTE I-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Along the Length-The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and the permitt,,,,,,,
variation from a flat surface along the length shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 3700 mm in length, or in a,,,,,,,
3700 mm of longer plates.,,,,,,,
NoTE 2-Permitted Variation From a Flat Surface Across the Width-The permitted variation from a flat surface across the width shall not exceed t,,,,,,,
tabular amount for the specified width.,,,,,,,
NoTE 3-When the longer dimension is under 900 mm, the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed 10 mm in each direction. Wh,,,,,,,
the larger dimension is from 900 to 1800 mm, incl., the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount for the specifi,,,,,,,
width but in no case less than 10 mm.,,,,,,,
NOTE 4--This table and these notes cover the permitted variations from a flat surface for circular and sketch plates, based upon the maximu,,,,,,,
dimensions of such plates.,,,,,,,
NoTE 5-Permitted variations in waviness do not apply.,,,,,,,
NoTE 6-Plates must be in a horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured.,,,,,,,
