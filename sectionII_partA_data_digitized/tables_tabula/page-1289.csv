homogenized or not, shall be given a solution treatment,,,,sis shall be agreed upon by purchaser and producer.
in accordance with 5.2.2 and unless ordered in the solution­,,,,

ordered condition (Table 2).,,,,7. Repair by Welding
5.2.1 Homogenization heat treatment shall consist,,,,7.1 Repairs shall be made only in one of the following
of heating the castings and test material to a minimum of,,,,conditions: homogenized, solution annealed, Hl 100,
1900°F [1040°], holding for a minimum of 11/z,h,,and,,Hl 150, Hl 150M, Hl 150DBL, or stress relieved at 1150°F
cooling to below 90°F [30°C].,,,,± 25°F [620°C ± 15°C] for a minimum of 4 h.
5.2.2 Solution annealing heat treatment shall consist,,,,7 .2 Castings welded in one of the aged conditions noted
of heating the castings and test material to 1925°F ± 50°F,,,,in 7 .1 shall be post weld heat treated by the same aging
[1050°C ± 30°C], holding the 30 min/in. [1.2 min/mm] of,,,,treatment used prior to welding, or, where necessary to
section but not less than 30 min, and cooling to below,,,,meet mechanical property requirements, shall be solution
90°F [30°C].,,,,annealed and aged after welding. Castings welded in the
5.2.3 Temperature used for precipitation hardening,,,,stress-relieved condition shall receive the specification heat
