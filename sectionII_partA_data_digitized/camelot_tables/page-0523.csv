8 Typical  steel  compositions used for this  grade include 4140,  4142,  4145,  4140H,  4142H,  and  4145H.,
° For the L7M grade, a minimum carbon content of 0.28 % is permitted provided that the required tensile properties are met in the section sizes involved; the use of AISI,
4130 or 4130H is allowed.,
° Class  1 are made from  solution-treated  material.  Class 1 A products (BSA,  B8CA,  B8MA,  B8PA,  B8FA,  and  B8TA)  are solution-treated  in  the finished  condition.  Class,
