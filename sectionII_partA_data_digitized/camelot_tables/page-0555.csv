Xl.1  Under the circumstances stated in 15 .4, the impact,pipe, the required reduction in test temperature is computed
test  temperatures  specified  in  Table  6  must  be  lowered.,by taking the difference between the temperature reduction
The following examples are offered to describe the applica,values shown in Table 7 for  the actual pipe thickness  and
tion of the  provisions  of 15.4.,the  specimen  width used.

notch of the  largest subsize  specimen obtainable is  0.160,ing to the actual pipe thickness is 10°F [5°C]; the difference
