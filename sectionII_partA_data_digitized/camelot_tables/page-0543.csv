Xl.  DETERMINATION  OF TEMPERATURE REDUCTIONS,
Xl.l  Under  the  circumstances  stated  in  14.1.2,  the  impact,required  reduction  in  test  temperature  is  computed  by  taking
test  temperatures  specified  in  Table  4  must  be  lowered.  The,the difference between the temperature reduction values shown
following  examples  are  offered  to  describe  the  application  of,in Table 6 for the actual pipe thickness and the specimen width
the provisions  of 14.1.2.,used.
Xl.1.1  When subsize specimens are used (see 10.1) and the,Xl.1.2.l  For example,  if the pipe were 0.262 in.  [6.67  mm]
width  along 
the  notch  of  the  subsize  specimen  in  80 %  or,thick and the width along the Charpy specimen notch was 3.33
greater of the actual wall  thickness of the original material, the,mm (1/3  standard size), the test temperature would have to  be

Xl.1.1.l  For  example,  if the  actual  wall  thickness  of pipe,
,corresponding  to  the  subsize  specimen  is  35  °F  [19  °C];  the
was  0.200  in.  [5.0  mm]  and  the  width  along  the  notch  of the,
