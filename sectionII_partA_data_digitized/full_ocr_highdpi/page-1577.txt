—- X3. HARDNESS PROPERTIES

. X3.1 Table X3.1 lists the typical hardness values. :

TABLE X3.1 Typical Hardness Values

Notre 1—The hardness values shown are at the time of shipment. |

Note 2—Tests for hardness shall be conducted in accordance with the

requirements of Test Methods E18.

Note 3—The hardness values are Rockwell B scale as measured or

converted from the appropriate Rockwell scales.

Note 4—The typical hardness values apply to the full range of steel”

sheet thickness. Hardness tends to increase as the steel sheet thickness

decreases.

aa Note 5—Hardness testing is commonly used to assess the relative ,

a formability of various designations of uncoated steel sheet. This assess-

ment done by many users is recognized to be only an approximation of the ;

. : relative formability and therefore cannot be used as a specification :
requirement.

Designation Hardness-Rockwell B Scale :

CS Type A 75 or less :

CS Type B 75 or less ;

CS Type C 75 or less ;

DS 65 or less |
