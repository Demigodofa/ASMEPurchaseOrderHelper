Nore 1—Cross-sectional area may be calculated by multiplying A and t. |
Notse 2—The dimension f¢ is the thickness of the test specimen as provided for in the applicable material specifications.
Note 3——The reduced section shall be parallel within 0.010 in. and may have a gradual taper in width from the ends toward the center, with the ends
not more than 0.010 in. wider than the center.
Note 4—The ends of the specimen shall be symmetrical with the center line of the reduced section within 0.10 in.
Note 5—Metric equivalent: 1 in. = 25.4 mm.
Note 6—Specimens with sides parallel throughout their length are permitted, except for referee testing, provided: (a) the above tolerances are used;
(b) an adequate number of marks are provided for determination of elongation; and (c) when yield strength is determined, a suitable extensometer is used.
If the fracture occurs at a distance of less than 2A from the edge of the gripping device, the tensile properties determined may not be representative of
the material. If the properties meet the minimum requirements specified, no further testing is required, but if they are less than the minimum requirements,
discard the test and retest.
Note 7—Specimen 5 is intended for testing specimens removed from an in-service product. Specimen 5 shall not be used for conformance testing of
( new product. Acceptance criteria for elongation values obtained from 1 in. gauge length specimens shall be determined by agreement between the
, responsible parties.
