SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS |

The following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the

purchase order or contract. __ :

S1. Thickness Tolerances

S1.1 See Tables $1.1-S1.6. | :

i TABLE $1.1 Thickness Tolerances for Hot-Rolled Sheet (Carbon and Structural Steel Only)—%-in. (Cut Edge) and %-in. (Mill Edge) :
\ Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut Lengths, Including Pickled)
- Nore 1—Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than *%% in. from a cut edge and not less than %4 in. from a mill edge. This table '
does not apply to the uncropped ends of mill edge coils. |

Note 2—Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in.

[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm]. cL

Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements. :

Note 3—This table was used to construct Table 4 by multiplying the values in this table by 0.75 and rounding to 3 decimal places using standard ASTM

practice. :

Note 4—The thickness of material <1 in. wide shall be measured at mid-width. ;

4 The specified thickness range captions apply independent of whether the ordered thickness is stated as a nominal or minimum. ;

® The tolerances provided in the table are based on minimum thickness (tolerance over, no tolerance under). For nominal thickness, the tolerance is divided equally over

and under. :
