4 The permitted variations in length for split tees or angles are the same as those
applicable to the section from which the tees or angles are split.
® The above permitted variations in depth of tees or angles include the permitted |
variations in depth for the beams or channels before splitting. Permitted variations |
. in dimensions and straightness, as set up for the beams or channels from which .
these tees or angles are cut, apply, except . !
straightness = 2 mm x length in metres ,

the difference in perpendicular distance between opposite faces, measured at the .
same transverse cross section. :
