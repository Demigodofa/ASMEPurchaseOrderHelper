<— ~ TABLE 15 Thickness Tolerances for Cold-Rolled Sheet (All Designations)“ —1-in. Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut Lengths)
: Note 1—Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than 1 in. from a side edge.

Note 2—Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in.

[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm].

Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements. :

Nore 3—The thickness of material <2 in. wide shall be measured at mid-width. |
