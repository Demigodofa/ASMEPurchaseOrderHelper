TABLE A1.7 Permissible Camber for Carbon Steel Sheared or _—
' Gas-Cut Rectangular Plates all Thicknesses |
Norte 1—Camber, as it relates to plates, is the horizontal edge curvature ,
in the length, measured over the entire length of the plate in the flat
position. |
Maximum permissible camber, in. = % in. x (number of feet of length/5)

TABLE A1.9 Permissible Variations from Flatness for Carbon Steel Plates ,
Norte 1—Flatness Variations for Length—The longer dimension specified is considered the length, and variation in flatness along the length shall not .
exceed the tabular amount for the specified width in plates up to 12 ft in length, or in any 12 ft of longer plates. ;
Note 2——Flatness Variations for Width—The flatness variation across the width shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width. ,
| Nore 3—When the longer dimension is under 36 in., the variation in flatness along the length and across the width shall not exceed % in. in each
direction. When the longer dimension is from.36 to 72 in., inclusive, the flatness variation shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount for the specified |
| width, but in no case less than /% in. )
Nots 4—The tolerances given in this table apply to plates that have a minimum specified tensile strength not over 60 ksi or comparable chemistry or
hardness. For plates specified to a higher minimum tensile strength or comparable chemistry or hardness, the limits given in the table are increased to |
1% times the amounts in the above table. |
Note 5—This table and notes cover the flatness tolerances of circular and sketch plates, based on the maximum dimensions of those plates. :
Note 6—Plates shall be in a horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured. ,
