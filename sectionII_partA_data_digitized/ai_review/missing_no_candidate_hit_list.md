# Missing No-Candidate Hit List

These items were marked **`missing_no_candidate`** because no matching note/table definition was found in `spec_corpus/` within the allowed anchors.

**Verification method:** open the spec PDF listed, go to the **approx. spec-local page** (computed as `globalPageIndex - specRangeStart + 1`), and verify whether the referenced NOTE/TABLE exists nearby.

> Tip: PDF page numbering can drift (covers/TOC). If the page is off, check ±3 pages and/or search the PDF for the reference string.
