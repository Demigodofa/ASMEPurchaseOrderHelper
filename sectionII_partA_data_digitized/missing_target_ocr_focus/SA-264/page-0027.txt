_ TABLE 13 Permitted Variations From a Flat Surface for Standard Flatness Carbon Steel Plates
Note 1—When the longer dimension is under 36 in., the permitted variation from a flat surface shall not exceed % in. When the longer dimension
is from 36 to 72 in., incl, the permitted variation from a fiat surface shall not exceed 75 % of the tabular amount for the specified width, but in no case .
less than % in. | :
Note 2—These permitted variations apply to plates that have a specified minimum tensile strength of not more than 60 ksi or comparable chemical :
composition or hardness. The limits in this table are increased 50 % for plates that have a higher specified minimum tensile strength or comparable
chemical composition or hardness.
Note 3—This table and these notes cover the permitted variations from a flat surface for circular and sketch plates, based upon the maximum
dimensions of such plates.
Note 4—-Where “...” appears in this table, there is no requirement. |
, Note 5—-Plates must be in a horizontal position on a flat surface when flatness is measured.

length shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width for plates up to 12 ft in length, or in any 12 ft for longer plates.
® Permitted Variation from a Flat Surface for Width—The permitted variation from a flat surface across the width shall not exceed the tabular amount for the specified width.
