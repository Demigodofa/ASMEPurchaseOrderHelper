SA-178/SA-178M (ASTM A178/A178M)

11. Mechanical Tests Required

11.1 Flattening Test:

11.1.1 For Grade A, one flattening test shall be made on
specimens from each of two tubes from each lot (Note 2) or
fraction thereof, and from each 2000 ft [600 m] or fraction
thereof of safe-end material.

11.1.2 For Grades C and D, one flattening test shall be made
on specimens from each of two tubes from each lot (Note 2) or
fraction thereof.

11.2 Flange Test:

11.2.1 For Grade A, one flange test shall be made on
specimens from each of two tubes from each lot (Note 2) or
fraction thereof, and from each 2000 ft [600 ml] or fraction
thereof of safe-end material.

11.2.2 For Grades C and D, one flange test shall be made on
specimens from each of two tubes from each lot (Note 2) or
fraction thereof. The width of the flange shall not be less than
75 % of that specified in Specification A450/A450M.

11.3 Crush Test—For Grade A, when required by the
purchaser, one crush test shall be made on specimens from
each of two tubes from each lot (Note 2) or fraction thereof,
and from each 2000 ft [600 m] or fraction thereof of safe-end
material.

11.4 Tension Test—For Grades C and D, one tension test
shall be made on specimens from each of two tubes from each
lot. The term lot for tension test requirements applies to all
tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall
thickness, which are produced from the same heat of steel.
When final heat treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall
include only those tubes of the same size and the same heat
which are heat treated in the same furnace charge. When the

ASME BPVCG.ILA-2025

final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, a lot shall
include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the
same furnace, at the same temperature, time at heat, and
furnace speed.

11.5 Reverse Flattening Test—One reverse flattening test
shall be made on each 1500 ft [450 m] of finished tubing.

11.6 Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test—Each
tube shall be subjected to either the hydrostatic or the nonde-
structive electric test. The purchaser may specify which test is
to be used.

12. Forming Operations

12.1 When inserted in the boiler, tubes shall withstand
expanding and beading without showing cracks or flaws, or
opening at the weld. When properly manipulated, superheater
tubes shall withstand all forging, welding, and bending opera-
tions necessary for application without developing defects.

13. Product Marking

13.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification
A450/A450M, the letters “ERW” shall be legibly stenciled on
each tube, or marked on a tag attached to the bundle or box in
which the tubes are shipped.

13.2 The manufacturer’s name or symbol may be placed
permanently on each tube by rolling or light stamping before
normalizing. If a single stamp is placed on the tube by hand,
this mark should not be less than 8 in. [200 mm] from one end
of the tube.

14. Keywords

14.1 boiler tube; resistance welded steel tube; steel tube,
carbon; welded steel tube

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS

The following supplementary requirements may become a part of the specification when specified
in the inquiry or invitation to bid, and production order or contract. These requirements shall not be
considered, unless specified in the order and the necessary tests shall be made at the mill.

S1. Additional Testing of Welded Tubing for ASME Re-
quirements

S1.1 The weld seam of each tube shall be subjected to an
ultrasonic inspection employing Practices E273 or E213 with
the rejection criteria referenced in Specification A450/A450M.

$1.2 If Practice E273 is employed, a 100 % volumetric
inspection of the entire length of each tube shall also be
performed using one of the nondestructive electric tests per-
mitted by Specification A450/A450M.

$1.3 The test methods described in the supplement may not
be capable of inspecting the end portions of tubes. This
condition is referred to as end effect. This portion, as deter-
mined by the manufacturer, shall be removed and discarded.

$1.4 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification
A450/A450M, “S1” shall be added after the grade designation.
