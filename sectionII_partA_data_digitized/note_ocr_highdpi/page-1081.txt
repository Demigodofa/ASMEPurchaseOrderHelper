After annealing, cold-rolled sheet is generally given a light
skin pass to impart shape or may be given a heavier skin pass
or temper pass to prevent the phenomenon known as stretcher
straining or fluting, when formed. Temper passing also pro-
vides a required surface texture.

4.5 Temper Rolling:

4.5.1 Unless otherwise specified, cold-rolled sheet for ex-
posed applications shall be temper rolled and is usually
specified and furnished in the strain free condition as shipped

sitions are required for carbon steel, they shall be prepared in
accordance with Appendix X2.

5.1.2 Where the material is used for fabrication by welding,
care must be exercised in selection of chemical composition or
mechanical properties to assure compatibility with the welding
process and its effect on altering the properties.

5.2 Cast or Heat Analysis:
5.2.1 An analysis of each cast or heat of steel shall be made
by the steel manufacturer to determine the percentage of

(see Appendix X1).

4.5.2 Cold-rolled sheet for unexposed applications may be
specified and furnished “annealed last” or “temper rolled.”
“Annealed last” is normally produced without temper rolling
but may be lightly temper rolled during oiling or rewinding.
Unexposed temper-rolled material may be specified strain-free
or nonfluting. Where specific hardness range or limit or a
specified surface texture is required, the application is consid-
ered as exposed.

Note 3—Skin-passed sheet is subject to an aging phenomenon (see
Appendix X1). Unless special killed (nonaging) steel is specified, it is to

the user’s interest to fabricate the sheet as soon as possible, for optimum
performance.

5. Chemical Composition

5.1 Limits:
5.1.1 The chemical composition shall be in accordance with
the applicable product specification. However, if other compo-

elements specified or restricted by the-applicable-specification,

5.2.2 When requested, cast or heat analysis for elements
listed or required shall be reported to the purchaser or to his
representative. The steel manufacturer, or the hot roll
manufacturer, cold roll manufacturer, or processor, if different
from the steel manufacturer, is responsible for providing this
information to the purchaser or his representative as requested.

5.3 Product, Check, or Verification Analysis:

5.3.1 Non-killed steels such as capped or rimmed steels are
not technologically suited to product analysis due to the
nonuniform character of their chemical composition; therefore,
the tolerances in Table 2 do not apply. Product analysis is
appropriate on these types of steel only when misapplication is
apparent or for copper when copper steel is specified.

5.3.2 For steels other than non-killed (capped or rimmed),
product analysis may be made by the purchaser. The chemical
analysis shall not vary from the limits specified by more than
