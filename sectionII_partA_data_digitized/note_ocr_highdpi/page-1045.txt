ASME BPVG.IL.A-2025

6. Chemical Composition

6.1 The steel shall conform to one of the requirements as to
chemical composition as prescribed in Table 1.

6.2 When a grade is ordered under this specification, sup-
plying an alloy grade that specifically requires the addition of
any element other than those listed for the ordered grade in
Table 1 is not permitted.

7. Product Analysis

7.1 When requested in the purchase order, a product analy-
sis shall be made by the manufacturer or supplier from one tube
or billet per heat.

7.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of
two additional tubes or billets shall be made. Both retests for
the elements in question shall meet the requirements of this
specification; otherwise, all remaining material in the heat or
lot (Note 1) shall be rejected or, at the option of the producer,
each tube may be individually tested for acceptance. Tubes that
do not meet the requirements of this specification shall be
rejected.

Note 1—For tension and hardness test requirements, the term lot
applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same nominal diameter and wall
thickness which are produced from the same heat of steel. When final heat
treatment is in a batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of
the same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the same furnace
charge. When the final heat treatment is in a continuous furnace, a lot shall
include all tubes of the same size and heat, heat treated in the same furnace
at the same temperature, time at heat and furnace speed.

7.3 For referee purposes, Test Methods A751 shall be used.

8. Mechanical Properties

8.1 Tensile Properties—The material shall conform to the
requirements as to tensile properties prescribed in Table 2,
when pulled in full section.

8.2 Hardness Requirements—The tubes shall not exceed the
Rockwell Hardness shown in Table 3.
9. Permissible Variations in Dimensions (Fig. 1)

9.1 Permissible variations from the specified outside diam-

1.0-in. [25.4-mm] outside diameter nor +0.006 in. [0.15 mm]
for tubing 1.0 in. [25.4 mm] to 1.25 in. [31.7 mm] inclusive.
These tolerances do not apply to the bent portion of the
U-tubes. At the bent portion of a U-tube for R = 2 x D or
greater neither the major nor minor diameter of tube: shall
deviate from nominal by more than 10 %. If 1% D is specified,
tolerances could be greater.

9.2. Permissible variations from the specified minimum wall
thickness shall not exceed +20 % or —0. The wall thickness of
the tube in U-bent section shall be not less than value
determined by:

t, = T (2R)/(2R+D) (1)
where:
t = wall thickness after bending, in. [mm],
T = specified minimum tube wall thickness, in. [mm],
R = centerline bend radius, in. [mm], and
D = nominal outside tube diameter, in. [mm].
9.3 In the case of U-tubes, the length of the tube legs as

measured from the point of tangency of the bend and the tube
leg to the end of the tube leg shall not be less than specified, but
may exceed the specified values by the amount given in Table
4. The difference in lengths of the tube legs shall not be greater
than % in. [3 mm] unless otherwise specified.

9.4 The end of any tube may depart from square by not
more than the amount given in Table 5.

9.5 The leg spacing measured between the points of tan-
gency of the bend to the legs shall not vary from the value (2R
~ specified tube OD) by more than “1c in. [1.5 mm] where R is
the centerline bend radius.

9.6 The bent portion of the U-tube shall be substantially
uniform in curvature and not exceed +o in. [1.5 mm] of the
normal centerline radius.

10.1 Finished tubes shall be free from scale but may have a
superficial oxide film on the surfaces. A light oxide scale on the
outside and inside surfaces of U-bend shall be allowed for
tubes which have been heat treated.

10.2 Finished tubes shall be reasonably straight and have
smooth ends free from burrs. Tubes shall have a workmanlike
finish and shall be free of surface imperfections that cannot be
removed within the allowable wall tolerances. Removal of
surface imperfections such as handling marks, straightening
marks, light mandrel and die marks, shallow pits, and scale
pattern will not be required provided they are within the
allowable wall tolerances.

10.3 Finished tubes shall be coated both on the outside and
the inside diameter to prevent corrosion in transit. The type of
coating applied should be mutually agreed upon and specified
in the order.
