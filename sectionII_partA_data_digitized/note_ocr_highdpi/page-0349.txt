ASME BPVGILA-2025

7. Chemical Composition

7.1 The steel shall conform to the following requirements as
to chemical composition:

Carbon, max % 0.18
Manganese, % 0.27 to 0.63
Phosphorus, max, % 0.035
Sulfur, max, % 0.035

7.2 Supplying an alloy grade of steel that specifically
requires the addition of any element other than those listed in
7.1 is not permitted.

8. Product Analysis

8.1 When requested on the purchase order, a product analy-
sis shall be made by the supplier from 1 tube per 250 pieces;
when tubes are identified by heat, one tube per heat shall be
analyzed. The chemical composition thus determined shall
conform to the requirements specified.

8.2 If the original test for product analysis fails, retests of
two additional lengths of flat-rolled stock, or tubes shall be
made. Both retests, for the elements in question, shall meet the
requirements of the specification; otherwise all remaining
material in the heat or lot (Note 1) shall be rejected or, at the
option of the producer, each length of flat-rolled stock or tube
may be individually tested for acceptance. Lengths of flat-
rolled stock or tubes which do not meet the requirements of the
specification shall be rejected.

Nortz 1—A lot consists of 250 tubes.

9. Hardness Requirements

9.1 The tubes shall have a hardness number not exceeding
72 HRBW.

10. Mechanical Tests Required

10.1 Flattening Test—One flattening test shall be made on
specimens from each of two tubes from each lot (Note 1) or
fraction thereof.

10.2 Flange Test—One flange test shall be made on speci-
mens from each of two tubes from each lot (Note 1) or fraction
thereof.

SA-214/SA-214M

10.3 Reverse Flattening Test—One reverse flattening test
shall be made on a specimen from each 1500 ft [450 m] of
finished tubing.

10.4 Hardness Test—Brinell or Rockwell hardness tests
shall be made on specimens from two tubes from each lot. The
term lot applies to all tubes prior to cutting, of the same
nominal diameter and wall thickness which are produced from
the same heat of steel. When final heat treatment is in a
batch-type furnace, a lot shall include only those tubes of the
same size and the same heat which are heat treated in the same
furnace charge. When final heat treatment is in a continuous
furnace, a lot shall include all tubes of the same size and heat,
heat treated in the same furnace at the same temperature, time
at heat, and furnace speed.

10.5 Hydrostatic or Nondestructive Electric Test—Each
tube shall be subjected to either the hydrostatic or the nonde-
structive electric test. The purchaser may specify which test is
to be used.

11. Surface Condition

11.1 The finished tubes shall be free of scale. A slight
amount of oxidation shall not be considered as scale.

12. Product Marking

12.1 In addition to the marking prescribed in Specification
A450/A450M, the letters “ERW” shall be legibly stenciled on
each tube, or marked on a tag attached to the bundle or box in
which the tubes are shipped.

12.2 The manufacturer’s name or symbol may be placed
permanently on each tube by rolling or light stamping before
normalizing. If a single stamp is placed on the tube by hand,
this mark should not be less than 8 in. [200 mm] from one end
of the tube.

12.3 Bar Coding—In addition to the requirements in 12.1
and 12.2 bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identifi-
cation method. The purchaser may specify in the order a
specific bar coding system to be used.
