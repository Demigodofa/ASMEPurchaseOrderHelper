11. Permissible Variations in Length

11.1 Variations from the specified length shall not exceed
the amounts prescribed in Table 4.

12. Permissible Variations in Height of Flash on Electric-
Resistance-Welded Tubes

12.1 For tubes manufactured to this specification, the weld
flash on the outside of the tube shall be mechanically removed
by cutting prior to any subsequent cold work or sizing.

12.2 For tubes over 2 in. [50.8 mm] in outside diameter, or
over 0.135 in. [3.44 mm] in wall thickness, the flash on the
inside of the tubes shall be mechanically removed by cutting to
a maximum height of 0.010 in. [0.25 mm] at any point on the
tube.

12.3 For tubes 2 in. [50.8 mm] and under in outside
diameter and 0.135 in. [3.4 mm] and under in wall thickness,
the flash on the inside of the tube shall be mechanically
removed by cutting to a maximum height of 0.006 in. [0.15
mm] at any point on the tube.

13. Straightness and Finish

13.1 Finished tubes shall be reasonably straight and have
smooth ends free of burrs. They shall have a workmanlike
finish. Surface imperfections (see Note 1) may be removed by
grinding, provided that a smooth curved surface is maintained,
and the wall thickness is not decreased to less than that
permitted by this or the product specification. The outside
diameter at the point of grinding may be reduced by the amount
so removed.

Nore 1—An imperfection is any discontinuity or irregularity found in
the tube.

14. Repair by Welding

14.1 Repair welding of base metal defects in tubing is
permissible only with the approval of the purchaser and with
the further understanding that the tube shall be marked “WR”
and the composition of the deposited filler metal shall be
suitable for the composition being welded. Defects shall be
thoroughly chipped or ground out before welding and each
repaired length shall be reheat treated or stress relieved as
required by the applicable specification. Each length of re-
paired tube shall be tested hydrostatically as required by the
product specification.

Seamless, hot-finished All sizes He [5] 0 [0]

4 These permissible variations in length apply to tubes before bending. They apply

to cut lengths up to and including 24 ft [7.3 m]. For lengths greater than 24 ft [7.3
m], the above over-tolerances shall be increased by % in. [3 mm] for each 10 ft [3
m] or fraction thereof over 24 ft or ¥% in. [13 mm], whichever is the lesser.

SA-450/SA-450M

14.2 Repair welding shall be performed using procedures
and welders or welding operators that have been qualified in
accordance with ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code,
Section IX.

15. Retests

15.1 If the results of the mechanical tests of any group or lot
do not conform to the requirements specified in the individual
specification, retests may be made on additional tubes of
double the original number from the same group or lot, each of
which shall conform to the requirements specified.

16. Retreatment

16.1 If the individual tubes or the tubes selected to represent
any group or lot fail to conform to the test requirements, the
individual tubes or the group or lot represented may be
retreated and resubmitted for test. Not more than two reheat
treatments shall be permitted.

17. Test Specimens

17.1 Test specimens shall be taken from the ends of finished
tubes prior to upsetting, swaging, expanding, or other forming
operations, or being cut to length. They shall be smooth on the
ends and free of burrs and flaws.

17.2 If any test specimen shows flaws or defective
machining, it may be discarded and another specimen substi-
tuted.

18. Method of Mechanical Testing

18.1 The specimens and mechanical tests required shall be
made in accordance with Annex A2 of Test Methods and
Definitions A370 if inch-pound units are specified or to the
requirements described in the applicable track of Test Methods
A1058 if SI units are specified.

18.2 Specimens shall be tested at room temperature.

18.3 Small or subsize specimens as described in Test
Methods and Definitions A370 or Test Methods A1058 may be
used only when there is insufficient material to prepare one of
the standard specimens. When using small or subsize
specimens, the largest one possible shall be used.

19, Flattening Test

19.1 A section of tube not less than 2 in. [63 mm] in
length for seamless and not less than 4 in. [100 mm] in length
for welded shall be flattened cold between parallel plates in two
steps. For welded tubes, the weld shall be placed 90° from the
direction of the applied force (at a point of maximum bending).
During the first step, which is a test for ductility, no cracks or
breaks, except as provided for in 19.4, on the inside, outside, or
end surfaces shall occur in seamless tubes, or on the inside or
outside surfaces of welded tubes, until the distance between the
plates is less than the value of H calculated by the following
equation:
