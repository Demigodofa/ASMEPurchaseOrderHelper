Age-Hardening Alloy Steel Forgings for Pressure Vessel

Components’

This standard is issued under the fixed designation A859/A859M; the number immediately following thé designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.
A superscript epsilon (¢) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.

e! NOTE—MPa value was added in 1.2.2 editorially in April 2019.

1. Scope

1.1 This specification covers requirements for low-carbon
age-hardening nickel-copper-chromium-molybdenum-
columbium alloy steel forgings for pressure vessel compo-
nents.

1.2 Forgings under this specification are available as Grades
A or B. Grade A may be ordered in one or two classes as
follows:

1.2.1 Grade A Class 1—Normalized-and-precipitation-heat-
treated, providing a minimum yield strength of 55 ksi
[380 MPa] and a minimum tensile strength of 65 ksi
[450 MPa].

1.2.2 Grade A Class 2—Quenched-and-precipitation-heat-
treated, providing a minimum yield strength of 65 ksi
[450 MPa] and a minimum tensile strength of 75 ksi
[515 MPa].

1.2.3 Grade A was the original steel composition in this
specification.

1.3 Although the material is readily weldable, welding
procedures are of fundamental importance and must be such as
not to affect adversely the properties of the material, especially
in the heat-affected zone. It is presupposed that welding
procedures will be suitable for the material being welded.

1.4 Supplementary requirements, including those applicable
in Specification A788/A788M, are provided for use when
additional testing or inspection is desired. These shall apply
only when specified individually by the purchaser in the order.

1.5 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in
each system are not necessarily exact equivalents; therefore, to
ensure conformance with the standard, each system shall be
used independently of the other and values from the two
systems shall not be combined.

1 This specification is under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee A01 on Steel,
Stainless Steel and Related Alloys and is the direct responsibility of Subcommittee
A01.06 on Steel Forgings and Billets.

Current edition approved March 1, 2019. Published April 2019. Originally
approved in 1986. Last previous edition approved in 2014 as A859/A859M-04
(2014). DOI:10.1520/A0859_A0859M-04R19E01.

1.6 This specification is expressed in both inch-pound and
SI units. However, unless the order specifies the applicable
“M” specification designation [SI units], the material shall be
furnished to inch-pound units.

1.7 This international standard was developed in accor-
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
