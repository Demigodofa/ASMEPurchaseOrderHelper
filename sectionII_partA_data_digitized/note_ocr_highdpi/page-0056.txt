1.2 Annex AI lists permitted variations in dimensions and
mass (Note 1) in SI units. The values listed are not exact
conversions of the values in Tables 1 to 31 inclusive but are,
instead, rounded or rationalized values. Conformance to Annex
Al is mandatory when the “M” specification designation is
used.

Note 1—The term “weight” is used when inch-pound units are the
standard; however, under SI, the preferred term is “mass.”

1.3 Annex A2 lists the dimensions of some shape profiles.

1.4 Appendix X1 provides information on coil as a source
of structural products.

1.5 Appendix X2 provides information on the variability of
tensile properties in plates and structural shapes.

1.6 Appendix X3 provides information on weldability.

1.7 Appendix X4 provides information on cold bending of
plates, including suggested minimum inside radii for cold
bending.

1.8 This general requirements specification also covers a
group of supplementary requirements that are applicable to
several of the above product specifications as indicated therein.
Such requirements are provided for use where additional
testing or additional restrictions are required by the purchaser,
and apply only where specified individually in the purchase
order.
