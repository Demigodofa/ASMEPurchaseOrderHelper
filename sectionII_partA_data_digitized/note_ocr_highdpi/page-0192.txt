Specification for

ASME BPVC.ILA-2025

Pipe, Steel, Black and Hot-Dipped, Zinc-Coated, Welded and

Seamless

1. Scope

1.1 This specification covers seamless and welded black
and hot-dipped galvanized steel pipe in NPS % to NPS 26 [DN
6 to DN 650] (Note 1), inclusive, with nominal wall thickness
(Note 2) as given in Table X2.2 and Table X2.3. It shall be
permissible to furnish pipe having other dimensions provided
that such pipe complies with all other requirements of this
specification. Supplementary requirements of an optional na-
ture are provided and shall apply only when specified by the
purchaser.

Nore 1—The dimensionless designators NPS (nominal pipe size) [DN
(diameter nominal)] have been substituted in this specification for such
traditional terms as “nominal diameter,” “size,” and “nominal size.”

Nore 2—The term nominal wall thickness has been assigned for the
purpose of convenient designation, existing in name only, and is used to
distinguish it from the actual wall thickness, which may vary over or
under the nominal wall thickness.

1.2 This specification covers the following types and
grades:

1.2.1 Type F—Furnace-butt-welded, continuous welded
Grade A,

1.2.2 Type E—Electric-resistance-welded, Grades A and B,
and ;

1.2.3 Type S—Seamless, Grades A and B.

Nore 3—See Appendix X1 for definitions of types of pipe.

1.3 Pipe ordered under this specification is intended for
mechanical and pressure applications and is also acceptable for
ordinary uses in steam, water, gas, and air lines. It is suitable
for welding, and. suitable for forming operations involving
coiling, bending, and flanging, subject to the following quali-
fications:

1.3.1 Type F is not intended for flanging.

1.3.2 If Type S or Type E is required for close coiling or
cold bending, Grade A is the preferred grade; however, this is
not intended to prohibit the cold bending of Grade B pipe.

1.3.3 Type E is furnished either nonexpanded or cold
expanded at the option of the manufacturer.

1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each
system shall be used independently of the other. Combining
values from the two systems may result in non-conformance
with the standard.

1.5 The following precautionary caveat pertains only to the
test method portion, Sections 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, and 15 of this
specification: This standard does not purport to address all of
the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-
priate safety, health, and environmental practices and deter-
mine the applicability of regulatory requirements prior to use.

1.6 The text of this specification contains notes or footnotes,
or both, that provide explanatory material. Such notes and
footnotes, excluding those in tables and figures, do not contain
any mandatory requirements.

1.7 This international standard was developed in accor-
dance with internationally recognized principles on standard-
ization established in the Decision on Principles for the
Development of International Standards, Guides and Recom-
mendations issued by the World Trade Organization Technical
Barriers to Trade (TBT) Committee.
