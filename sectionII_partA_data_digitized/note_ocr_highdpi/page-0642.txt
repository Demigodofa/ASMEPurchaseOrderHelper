(Note 2)

Nore 1—The reduced section may have a gradual taper from the ends toward the center, with the ends not more than 1 % larger in diameter than the
center (controlling dimension).

Nore 2—If desired, the length of the reduced section may be increased to accommodate an extensometer of any convenient gauge length. Reference
marks for the measurement of elongation should, nevertheless, be spaced at the indicated gauge length.

Nore 3—The gauge length and fillets shall be as shown, but the ends may be of any form to fit the holders of the testing machine in such a way that
the load shall be axial (see Fig. 9). If the ends are to be held in wedge grips it is desirable, if possible, to make the length of the grip section great enough
to allow the specimen to extend into the grips a distance equal to two thirds or more of the length of the grips.

Nore 4—On the round specimens in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, the gauge lengths are equal to four times the nominal diameter. In some product specifications
other specimens may be provided for, but unless the 4-to-1 ratio is maintained within dimensional tolerances, the elongation values may not be comparable
with those obtained from the standard test specimen.

Nore 5—The use of specimens smaller than 0.250-in. (6.25 mm) diameter shall be restricted to cases when the material to be tested is of insufficient
size to obtain larger specimens or when all parties agree to their use for acceptance testing. Smaller specimens require suitable equipment and greater
skill in both machining and testing.

Nore 6—Five sizes of specimens often used have diameters of approximately 0.505, 0.357, 0.252, 0.160, and 0.113 in., the reason being to permit easy
calculations of stress from loads, since the corresponding cross sectional areas are equal or close to 0.200, 0.100, 0.0500, 0.0200, and 0.0100 in?,
respectively. Thus, when the actual diameters agree with these values, the stresses (or strengths) may be computed using the simple multiplying factors
5, 10, 20, 50, and 100, respectively. (The metric equivalents of these fixed diameters do not result in correspondingly convenient cross sectional area and
multiplying factors.)

10.1 The standard plate-type test specimens are shown in
Fig. 3. Such specimens are used for testing metallic materials

material having a nominal thickness of %16 in. (5 mm) or over.
When product specifications so permit, other types of speci-
mens may be used.

12.2 Fig. 4 also shows small size specimens proportional to
the standard specimen. These may be used when it is necessary
to test material from which the standard specimen or specimens
shown in Fig. 3 cannot be prepared. Other sizes of small round
specimens may be used. In any such small size specimen it is
important that the gauge length for measurement of elongation
