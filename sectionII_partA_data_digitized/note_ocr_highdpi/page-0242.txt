SA-135/SA-135M (ASTM A135/A135M)

(Note 6) and cut so as to make a tight joint when the pipe is
tested at the mill to the specified internal hydrostatic pressure.
The variation from the standard, when tested with the standard
working gauge, shall not exceed one and one-half turns either
way. Pipe shall not be rounded by hammering in order to get a
full thread. There shall be not more than two black threads for
¥%-in. [19.0-mm] taper among the perfect threads. Black
threads should not be confused with imperfect threads, such as
those torn, shaven, or broken.

Nore 6—A complete description of the American National Standard
Pipe Threads applicable to pipe, valves, and fittings is contained in ASME
B1.20.1; also “Screw-Thread Standards for Federal Services, 1942,”
National Bureau of Standards Handbook H 28, January, 1942, the perti-
nent data in both sources being identical.

13.3. Couplings—Each length of threaded pipe shall be
provided with one coupling manufactured in accordance with
Specification A865/A865M except that the coupling may be
wrought iron (Note 7). Threads shall be cut so as to make a
tight joint. Taper-tapped couplings shall be furnished on all
weights (masses) of threaded pipe NPS 22 [DN 65] and larger.

Note 7—For sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and smaller, it is commercial
practice to furnish straight-tapped couplings for standard-weight (mass)
(Schedule 40) pipe and taper-tapped couplings for extra-strong (Schedule
80) and double-extra-strong pipe. If taper-tapped couplings are required
for sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and smaller on standard weight (mass) (Schedule
40) pipe, line pipe in accordance with Specification 5L of the American
Petroleum Institute should be ordered, thread lengths to be in accordance
with ASME B1.20.1. Taper-tapped couplings for sizes NPS 2 [DN 50] and
smaller in standard weight (mass) may be used on mill-threaded standard
weight (mass) type of the same size.

13.4 Protective Coating:

13.4.1 After the pipe has been subjected to the hydrostatic
test, and if required by the purchaser, it shall be thoroughly
cleaned of all dirt, oil, grease, loose scale, and rust; then dried,
and given a protective coating of the kind and in the manner
specified by the purchaser. Pipe furnished to Schedule 10 shall
be normally shipped with a light coating of processing oil. If so
specified, the pipe can be given a mill coating or a special
coating.

14. Weld Repair
14.1 Welding Repair:

14.2 Defects in the pipe wall, provided their depth does not
exceed one third the specified wall thickness, shall be repaired
by electric welding. Defects in the welds such as sweats or
leaks, unless otherwise specified, shall be repaired or the piece
rejected at the option of the manufacturer. Repairs of this
nature shall be made by completely removing the defect,
cleaning the cavity, and then electric welding.

14.3 All repaired pipe shall be retested hydrostatically in
accordance with Section 10.

15. Sampling

15.1 Chemical Analysis:

15.1.1 Samples for chemical analysis shall be taken in
accordance with Test Method, Practices, and Terminology
A751. The number of samples shall be determined as follows:

190

ASME BPVC.ILA-2025

NPS Numbers of Samples Selected
Under 6 [DN 150] 2 from each lot of 400 pipes or fraction
thereof
6 [DN 150] to 20 [DN 2 from each lot of 200 pipes or fraction
500], incl thereof
Over 20 [DN 500] to 2 from each lot of 100 pipes or fraction
30 [DN 750], incl thereof

15.2 Tension Test:

15.2.1 One longitudinal tension test shall be made on one
length (Note 8) from each lot of 400 lengths or fraction thereof
of each size under NPS 8 [DN 200] and one transverse body
and one transverse weld tension test on one length from each
lot of 200 lengths or fraction thereof of each size NPS 8 to NPS
20 [DN 200 to DN 500] and on one length from each lot of 100
lengths or fraction thereof of each size over NPS 20 to NPS 30
[DN 500 to DN 750]. When taken from the skelp, the number
of tests shall be determined in the same manner as when taken
from the finished pipe.

Nor 8—Length is defined as the length as ordered, except that in the
case of orders for cut lengths shorter than double random, which is defined
as the length as rolled, prior to cutting to the required short lengths.

15.3 Flattening Test:

15.3.1 When pipe is produced in single length, the flattening
test specified in 9.1 shall be made on both crop ends cut from
each length of pipe. When pipe is produced in multiple lengths,
flattening tests are required on the crop ends from the front and
back ends of each coil and on two intermediate rings repre-
senting each coil.

15.4 Hydrostatic Test:

15.4.1 Each length of pipe shall be subjected to the hydro-
static test specified in Section 10.

16. Test, Retest, and Resampling

16.1 Chemical Analysis:

16.1.1 If the results of the analysis of either length of pipe
does not conform to the requirements specified in Section 7,
analyses of two additional lengths from the same lot shall be
made, each of which shall conform to the requirements
specified.

16.2 Tension Test:

16.2.1 The test specimens and the tests required by this
specification shall conform to those described in Test Methods
and Definitions A370, except that all specimens shall be tested
at room temperature.

16.2.2 The longitudinal tension test specimen shall be taken
from the end of the pipe, or by agreement between the
manufacturer and the purchaser may be taken from the skelp,
at a point approximately 90° from the weld, and shall not be
flattened between gauge marks. The sides of each specimen
shall be parallel between gauge marks. At the manufacturer
option, the tension test may be made on full section of pipe.

16.2.3 Transverse weld test specimens shall be taken with
the weld at the center of the specimen. Transverse body test
specimens shall be taken opposite to the weld. All transverse
test specimens shall be approximately 11 in. [38 mm] wide in
the gauge length and shall represent the full wall thickness of
the pipe from which the specimen was cut.
