16. Rejection

16.1 Each part that develops defects during shop working
operations or in service shall be rejected and the manufacturer
notified.

16.2 Samples representing material rejected by the pur-
chaser shall be preserved until disposition of the claim has been
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser.

17. Certification

17.1 In addition to the certification requirements of Speci-
fication A961/A961M, test reports shall be furnished to the
purchaser or his representative. Test reports shall provide the
following as applicable:

17.1.1 Type of heat treatment, Section 7 (Table 2).

17.1.2 Chemical analysis results, Section 6 (Table 1), re-
ported results shall be to the same number of significant figures
as the limits specified in Table 1 for that element.

17.1.3 Product analysis results, Section 11 (Table 4),

17.1.4 Tensile property results, Section 9 (Table 3), report
the yield strength and tensile strength, in ksi [MPa], elongation
and reduction in area, in percent,

17.1.5 Hardness results, 9.6 (Table 3)

17.1.6 Structural integrity test results, Section 8, and

17.1.7 Any supplementary testing required by the purchase
order.

18. Product Marking

18.1 In addition to marking requirements of Specification
A961/A961M, the following additional marking requirements
shall apply:

ASME BPVG.II.A-2025

18.1.1 Quenched and tempered martensitic stainless steel
parts shall be marked with the letters QT following the
specification designation.

18.1.2 Hot isostatically-pressed parts repaired by welding
shall be marked with the letter “W” following the specification
designation.

18.1.3 Hot isostatically-pressed parts meeting all require-
ments for more than one class or grade are permitted, at the
option of the producer, to be marked with more than one class
or grade designation, such as $30400/S30409, $30400/S30403,
etc.

18.2 Bar Coding—In addition to the requirements in 18.1,
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identification
method. The purchaser is permitted to specify in the order that
a specific bar coding system be used. The bar coding system, if
applied at the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent
with one of the published industry standards for bar coding. If
used on small parts, the bar code may be applied to the box or
a substantially applied tag.

SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS

The following supplementary requirements shall apply only when specified by the purchaser in the

contract or order.

S1. Macroetch Test

$1.1 A sample part shall be sectioned and etched to show
internal imperfections. The test shall be conducted according to
Test Method E340. Details of the test shall be agreed upon
between the manufacturer and the purchaser.

S2. Product Analysis

$2.1 A product analysis in accordance with Section 11 shall
be made from one randomly selected part representing each
size and type (See Note 3) of part on the order. If the analysis
fails to comply, each part in that lot, at the option of the
manufacturer, shall be checked and accepted if the analysis for
the part complies with the requirements, or the lot shall be
rejected. All results shall be reported to the purchaser.

S3. Tension Tests

$3.1 In addition to the requirements of Section 9, one
tension specimen shall be obtained from a representative part
from each production lot at a location agreed upon between the

manufacturer and the purchaser. The results of the test shall
comply with Table 3 and shall be reported to the purchaser.

S4. Magnetic Particle Examination

S4.1 All accessible surfaces of a finished martensitic, age
hardening, or austenitic-ferritic stainless steel part, shall be
examined by a magnetic-particle method. The method shall be
in accordance with Test Method A275/A275M. Acceptance
limits shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer and
purchaser.

S5. Liquid Penetrant Examination

$5.1 All accessible surfaces shall be examined by a liquid
penetrant method in accordance with Test Method E165/
E165M. Acceptance limits shall be agreed upon between the
manufacturer and the purchaser.

S6. Hydrostatic Testing

$6.1 A hydrostatic test at a pressure agreed upon between
the manufacturer and the purchaser shall be applied by the
manufacturer.
