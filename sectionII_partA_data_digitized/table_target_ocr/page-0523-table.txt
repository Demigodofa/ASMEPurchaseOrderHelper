4 The intentional addition of Bi, Se, Te, and Pb is not permitted except for Grade B8F, in which selenium is specified and required.
® Typical steel compositions used for this grade include 4140, 4142, 4145, 4140H, 4142H, and 4145H.
© For the L7M grade, a minimum carbon content of 0.28 % is permitted provided that the required tensile properties are met in the section sizes involved; the use of AISI
4130 or 4130H is allowed.
’ Class 1 are made from solution-treated material. Class 1A products (BBA, B8CA, B8MA, BSPA, B8FA, and B8TA) are solution-treated in the finished condition. Class
2 products are solution-treated and strain-hardened.
