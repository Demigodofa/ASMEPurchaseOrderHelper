. X3.1 Table X3.1 lists the typical hardness values.
TABLE X3.1 Typical Hardness Values :
Nors 1—The hardness values shown are at the time of shipment.
Nore 2—Tests for hardness shall be conducted in accordance with the :
requirements of Test Methods E18.
Note 3—The hardness values are Rockwell B scale as measured or :
converted from the appropriate Rockwell scales. .
Note 4—The typical hardness values apply to the full range of steel’ :
sheet thickness. Hardness tends to increase as the steel sheet thickness ‘
decreases. :
aa Note 5—Hardness testing is commonly used to assess the relative
a formability of various designations of uncoated steel sheet. This assess-
: ment done by many users is recognized to be only an approximation of the
relative formability and therefore cannot be used as a specification :
requirement.
Designation Hardness-Rockwell B Scale :
: CS Type A 75 or less ;
CS Type B 75 or less :
CS Type C 75 or less
DS 65 or less
