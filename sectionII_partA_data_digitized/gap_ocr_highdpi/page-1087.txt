Nore 2—Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in.
[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm].
Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements. =:
Nore 3—The thickness of material <2 in. wide shall be measured at mid-width.
