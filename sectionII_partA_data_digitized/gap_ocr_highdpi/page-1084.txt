TABLE 4 Thickness Tolerances for Hot-Rolled Sheet (Carbon and Structural Steel Only)—5-in. (Cut Edge) and 1-in. (Mill Edge) —— ;

: Minimum Edge Distance (Coils and Cut Lengths, Including Pickled)

Note 1—Thickness is measured at any point across the width not less than % in. from a cut edge and not less than 1 in. from a mill edge. This table
does not apply to the uncropped ends of mill edge coils.

Nore 2—Micrometers used for measurement of thickness shall be constructed with anvils and spindles having minimum diameters of 0.188 in.
[4.80 mm]. The tip of the spindle shall be flat, and the tip of the anvil shall be flat or rounded with a minimum radius of curvature of 0.10 in. [2.55 mm].
Micrometers with pointed tips are not suitable for thickness measurements.

Nore 3—The thickness of material <2 in. wide shall be measured at mid-width. :
