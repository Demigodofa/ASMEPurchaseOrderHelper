For example, Grades 304, \n304L, and 347 are accepted by the ASME Pressure Vessel Code, Section \nVIII Division 1, and by the Chemical Plant and Refinery Piping Code, \nANSI 831.3 for service at temperatures as low as -425 \u00b0F [-250 \u00b0C] \nwithout qualification by impact tests. Other AISI stainless steel grades are \nusually accepted for service temperatures as low as -325 \u00b0F [-200 \u00b0C] \nwithout impact testing. Impact testing may, under certain circumstances, \nbe required. For example, materials with chromium or nickel content \noutside the AISI ranges, and for material with carbon content exceeding \n0.10 %, are required to be impact tested under the rules of ASME Section \nVIII Division 1 when service temperatures are lower than -50 \u00b0F [-45 \noq, \n1.2 Grades TP304H, TP304N, TP316H, TP316N, TP321H, \nTP347H, and TP348H are modifications of Grades TP304, \nTP316, TP321, TP347, and TP348, and are intended for \nhigh-temperature service. \n1.3 Two classes of pipe are covered as follows: \n1.3.1 Class SW-Pipe, single-welded with no addition of \nfiller metal and \n1.3.2 Class DW-Pipe, double-welded with no addition of \nfiller metal. \n1.4 Optional supplementary requirements are provided for \npipe where a greater degree of testing is desired. These \nsupplementary requirements call for additional tests to be made \nand, when desired, one or more of these may be specified in the \norder. \n1.5 Table 1 lists the dimensions of cold-worked single- or \ndouble-welded stainless steel pipe. Pipe having other dimen-\nsions may be furnished provided such pipe complies with all \nother requirements of this specification. \n1.6 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units \nare to be regarded separately as standard.
